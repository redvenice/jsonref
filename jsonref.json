Each intimate encounter leaves her feeling physically and emotionally high, \u0027warm and glowing\u0027, something she puts down to the release of the hormone oxytocin.Janice Hiller supports her theory and agrees a regular sex life brings significant health benefits, for both women and men, by increasing pleasure chemicals and reducing those that cause stress. \u0027During sex our bodies release more oxytocin, the bonding and stress-reducing hormone, and dopamine, which is the reward, pleasure and drive chemical,\u0027 says Janice. \u0027It also reduces levels of the stress chemical, cortisol.\u0027Research on men, has shown that those who have regular orgasms are less likely to have heart attacks. There aren\u0027t really any downsides.\u0027Mismatched libidos were, however, a major issue for Helen Robinson, 56, who ended a long-term relationship a year ago partly due to her partner\u0027s interest in sex waning while her own ardour was undiminished.To avoid a repeat of this, instead of looking for another man her own age, Helen made her first foray into the world of online dating, with the deliberate intention of meeting men in their 30s, and even 20s.         Helen Carroll pictured with her husband Atef at their wedding. \u0027We don\u0027t need fluffy handcuffs or different clothes to keep things interesting,\u0027 says Carol. \u0027Sometimes it\u0027s over quickly, and sometimes it\u0027s not. That tends to depend on him and how tired he\u0027s feeling\u0027She believes that they are more likely to have libidos matching her own.The chef, from South London, makes it clear on her dating profile that she is interested in a sexual, not a committed, relationship, and often dates three men at a time, seeing them on different nights.\u0027Ideally I would have sex every day, three times a day when I\u0027m not working,\u0027 says Helen.\u0027When I first met my ex he was very similar to me, but, by the time we separated, I was lucky if he was up for it once a month.\u0027It makes you feel very vulnerable when you want a sexual connection with someone who no longer wants one with you.\u0027Sex is energising and fun — it can be wild, fierce, tender. Being desired is a delicious feeling but I think people wrongly assume that post-menopausal women aren\u0027t interested in sex because most of us moderate our behaviour to fit in with society\u0027s expectations.\u0027The men in my life now know they are not my one and only.\u0027But Helen is keen to stress that climbing into bed is not the only thing she wants to do on a date, many of which begin in an art gallery, or the pub, chatting about literature and cooking.Helen has been seeing one man for ten months, while other couplings have fizzled out, sometimes because the men are looking for a more serious relationship.But what, one wonders, do these young men see in a woman who, while still attractive and in good shape thanks to exercising five times a week, is in her sixth decade?\u0027I realise there\u0027s social stigma around this, so I often ask the men I date: \u0027What\u0027s attractive to you about being with an older woman?\u0027 \u0027 says Helen.\u0027I\u0027m told it\u0027s because fiftysomething women, like me, tend to be more confident about what we want, and are happy to say it, which men find very appealing.\u0027We\u0027re also less hung up on what people think about us.\u0027On the subject of judgment, what do Helen\u0027s friends make of her passion? \u0027Some of them are surprised and ask: \u0027Where do you find the energy?\u0027 \u0027 she says.\u0027I was embarrassed at first to tell them I was dating younger men, but they\u0027ve mostly said: \u0027That\u0027s great.\u0027 \u0027Still, Helen is sure that, ultimately, she will want another monogamous, long-term relationship, probably with someone close to her own age, with whom she is likely to have more in common.However, one thing is certain: next time around, Helen will ensure that, like Hayley and Carol, she settles down with a man whose sexual appetite remains as insatiable as her own.n Is your marriage full of midlife passion?

The most recent one on a Taliban website was dated June 2017.In the article, Haqqani said the \u0027long war has exacted a terrible cost from everyone\u0027.  The leader of a group known for masterminding some of the most deadly attacks during the war and the frequent use of suicide bombers also says he is \u0027convinced the killing and the maiming must stop\u0027.          Others also criticized the New York Times over the opinion piece                           One user shared screenshots from the FBI which shows Haqqani as one of America\u0027s most wanted          This image gives details about the Haqqani and what he\u0027s wanted for, including the January 2008 attach on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen \u0027For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war.\u0027We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. \u0027The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,\u0027 he wrote.   Haqqani repeats many Taliban talking points from the negotiations, including how women would have rights \u0027granted by Islam\u0027 - the problem being, as many observers have pointed out, the group\u0027s repressive interpretation of the faith.The Taliban banned women from education and work and only let them leave their homes in the company of a male relative. Overnight, women disappeared behind the all-enveloping burqa, their activities restricted to their homes. The Taliban have been conducting direct talks with the US since 2018 on a deal which would see Washington begin pulling troops out in return for security guarantees from the militants and a promise to begin peace talks with the government in Kabul.         Congressman Jim Banks said he is \u0027appalled\u0027 that the Times \u0027has given leader of the Haqqani network and leader in Taliban room in their editorial pages to espouse his views\u0027                                    The agreement could come as soon as February 29, though no date has yet been made public.But he also admitted that the group is \u0027aware of the concerns and questions\u0027 over any potential Taliban return to power.Many Afghans have voiced anger at being sidelined from the talks, and resistance to returning to life under the militants\u0027 repressive regime - though many others simply want security and for the violence to end.\u0027My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans,\u0027 Haqqani writes, adding that the Taliban was ready to agree on \u0027a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded\u0027.He also states that concerns about Afghanistan being used by foreign militant groups to \u0027threaten regional and world security\u0027 are \u0027inflated\u0027.The US invaded Afghanistan after the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by Al Qaeda, who were guests of the Taliban at the time.One of the promises believed to be included in the deal is for the Taliban to ban any foreign militant groups on Afghan soil.The Afghan presidential palace also reacted strongly to the article.\u0027It is sad that the (New York Times) has given their platform to an inidual who is on a designated terrorist list. He and his network are behind ruthless attacks against Afghans and foreigners,\u0027 Sediq Sediqqi, a palace spokesman, told Reuters.Deadly Bombing in Kabul Is One of the Afghan War’s Worst Strikes - The New York Times‘It’s a Massacre’: Blast in Kabul Deepens Toll of a Long War - The New York TimesGrounded and Gutted, Main Afghan Airline Struggles After Taliban Attack - The New York TimesOpinion | What We, the Taliban, Want - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"One year old doesnt time wait heads face birthday cake","story":"Share this article           The youngster takes a look around to check that she\u0027s not in trouble for her sickly sweet antics              The girl then es back into the cake for a second helping leaving her face caked in frosting"},{"url":null,"title":"Ministers dont want work Dominic Cummings shut says Tory Lord","story":"Share this article The camps in No10 and No11 were in a barely-concealed state of war for months, with increasingly brutal briefing.However, Lord Blencathra, who as David Maclean was a Home Office minister in John Major\u0027s government, hailed Mr Cummings as a \u0027mastermind\u0027.

Anton Kusters’ The Blue Skies Project is a study in stillness: a flat grid of 1,078 Polaroid images, each subtly different, their apparent ordinariness at odds with their immense symbolism. Over several years, Kusters photographed a small patch of blue sky above the site of every known second world war concentration camp in Europe. Each Polaroid is stamped with a row of numerals that correspond to the GPS coordinates of a camp and the number of people who perished there.I previously described the piece as “deeply meditative”, but now I am not sure. The formalism of the arrangement and the relative sameness of each image, alongside the subtle lighting and the long-form ambient soundscape by Ruben Samama, is certainly calming, but that is not quite the same thing.The painstaking research that went into the creation of the installation is, in itself, a profound act of memory. Likewise, the soundscape, which s the years that the death camps were active, each subterranean bleep you hear representing a death. The Polaroids, though, for all their quietness and temporal fragility, made me wonder about the limits of photography that the ever-prescient Benjamin instinctively sensed. They are, says Ulrich Baer in his catalogue essay, “an archive of the unseen”. Maybe so, but for that very reason, they seem almost weightless, their impact curiously muted. This could be to do with the context. The installation was previously exhibited in the solemn setting of the nearby Fitzrovia Chapel one wonders how much its resonance has been altered, even diminished, by its inclusion in a group show in a traditional gallery setting.For the activist-artist, Mohamed Bourouissa, whose work possesses an edgy contemporary resonance, the problem is a practical one. Of the four contenders, he suffers the most from the venue’s lack of space.Bourouissa has been nominated for his sprawling multimedia installation, Free Trade, a highlight of Les Rencontres d’Arles last summer. There, it occupied an entire top floor of a vast Monoprix supermarket, his use of surveillance cameras, 3D sculptures, footage shot on stolen mobile phones and grainy security shots of shoplifters an almost overwhelming evocation of contemporary global capitalism and its alienating effect on the marginalised youth of Parisian suburbs. Here, it is condensed into one half of a relatively modest gallery space and loses some of the freeform overload that made it such a viscerally immersive experience.Curator Anna Dannemann has worked hard to reconfigure the installation – visitors can conjure up a spectral Army of the Unemployed via an app as they negotiate the space – but the reduced scale means visitors only experience a fraction of its full force.The work of the other two contenders, though radically different in style, seems more suited to the small gallery setting. Mark Neville began shooting portraits of the residents of Guingamp, Brittany, in 2016 on the day that the UK voted to leave the EU. The region’s historical links to Britain date back to the various flows of immigration between the third and sixth centuries. As Neville’s photographs show, there is still something oddly British about the place and its people, whether in the traditional velvet waistcoats of the local hunters or the glimpse of a codified class system that separates the workers engaged in industrial-scale food production from the landed gentry.If Neville’s engagement with the local community amounts to a kind of sustained creative collaboration, the complexity of his undertaking also depends to a crucial degree on the information contained in a free booklet produced for the exhibition. In it, locals describe their jobs and articulate their concerns about the future of localism in an increasingly globalised world. Its subtext, though, is that images alone cannot convey the full intricacy of the region and its people.Clare Strand has made her name by grappling in her slightly madcap way with the limits of photography. Her installation The Discrete Channel with Noise revisits a pioneering 1930s attempt to telegraphically transmit images. Using black and white photographs from her personal collection, she recreated the analogue experiment, using smartphone technology. Her husband applied a numbered grid to each image, with each number denoting a tone of grey between black and white. He then transmitted the coded information to her over the telephone from the UK to Paris. Strand then used the same grid to make large-scale paintings based on the information she received.The original photographs, gridded in pencil, line one wall in the gallery, while the corresponding lego-like monochrome paintings loom large on two adjacent walls. A long row of much-used paintbrushes and encrusted tubs of paint are arranged in a vitrine as evidence of the hands-on labour involved in making the work. In an information age defined by the tyranny of the algorithm and the constant low-level anxiety induced by our often duplicitous information culture, it is an oddly relevant, if slightly bonkers, response.

A year ago Houchen reached a deal with Tata to transfer 1,420 acres, an area almost the size of Gibraltar and more than half of the developable land at the former Redcar Steelworks, to the Development Corporation.The latest announcement means the overwhelming majority of land at the former steelworks site is now under the control of the South Tees Development Corporation.Houchen said: “I am delighted that today we have reached an agreement with SSI to take back control of the site of the former Redcar steelworks.“Thanks to the agreement we have reached, we can move forward in breathing new life into an area that was devastated following the steelworks’ closure in 2015.“With the potential to create more than 20,000 jobs over the next two decades, today really marks the beginning of a new era.”“I am grateful to the representatives of SSI, and everyone involved in the negotiations, who have worked so hard over recent days to be able to get this over the line.“The journey to this point has not always been an easy or straight forward one, but through the hard work, dedication and commitment of all involved I am pleased we have been able to reach an agreement that works for all parties.”Win Viriyaprapakit, CEO of SSI, said: “Over the last three weeks, we have been in intensive talks with mayor Houchen and his team to deliver a solution that works for everyone involved, and I am pleased a deal has now been done.“I am also grateful for the Thai banks’ support and their good intentions for this regeneration of this region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6ce2ad44c3aba7ed5ee99015cd05426024fe9a/0_395_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fdad239e7034756006323e4a6ec6836","title":"bernie sanders russia putin kremlin","story":"Whereas recent US foreign policy has emboldened the Kremlin, Sanders actually understands how to undermine itHe may not be running, but Vladimir Putin is already a formidable presence in the 2020 US presidential campaign. From concerns about Russian aggression abroad to anxieties about electoral interference at home, Putin has become a question to which all presidential candidates are expected to have a strongly worded answer – particularly in the wake of Donald Trump’s failed impeachment, in which the Democratic party sought to make the case that “all roads lead to Putin”.The conventional wisdom in US foreign policy is that military competition is necessary to contain Putin and circumscribe the Russian sphere of influence. “The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia over there, and we don’t have to fight Russia over here,” said the Republican adviser Tim Morrison during the impeachment hearings – a quote then repeated by Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, in his opening argument.It is in this context that the rise of Bernie Sanders is raising fears inside the Democratic party establishment. Sanders has long been a leading advocate of military restraint, and he is campaigning on a platform of “responsible foreign policy” that promises to end America’s “endless war”. Despite speech after speech in which the senator decries Putin’s criminal authoritarianism, a narrative is now developing that his presidency would amount to a great gift to the Kremlin. “If I’m Russian, I go with Sanders this time around,” tweeted the former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.But most advocates of military competition fundamentally misunderstand the nature of Kremlin power – a misunderstanding that has led the US to fail, time and again, in its attempt to contain Putin. The promise of Sanders’ foreign policy platform is precisely that it turns the conventional wisdom on its head, showing how the US government can use domestic reform as a strategy to undermine Putin’s authoritarian aggression abroad.To make sense of this strategy, it is necessary to see the three pillars on which Putin’s regime rests. The first of these pillars is hydrocarbons: the vast reserves of oil and gas in Russia that deliver large revenues and deep political loyalties both within Russia and across Europe. Russian oil and gas output is currently at a record high 11.25m barrels per day, generating $44.4bn each year from countries such as Germany that have become heavily reliant on Russian gas exports.The second pillar of Putin’s power is corruption. Russia is today a kleptocracy, a political system that runs on kickbacks, bribes and pocketed public money for loyal oligarchs. Their dark money, of course, does not stay in Russia. Instead, it circulates through the vast international system of murky finance – into Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank, into London real estate and US shell companies – buying allegiance to the regime along the way.And the third pillar is propaganda: Putin and his allies actively seek to stir up conflict abroad in order to strengthen nationalist loyalties at home. From the very beginning of his tenure, Putin has fomented violence and aggression against Russia’s “enemies” – be they Chechen, Ukrainian or American – as a strategy to boost his own popularity.Far from attacking these pillars of Kremlin power, recent US foreign policy has served to strengthen them. The Barack Obama administration, for example, aggressively pursued a fossil fuels arms race against Russia, further entrenching the global addiction to hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, Obama presided over a flood of Russian oligarchs’ cash into the US, even as his secretary of state, Hillary Cinton, drew comparisons between Putin and Hitler.Sanders, by contrast, seeks to dismantle each of the three pillars at their base. Rather than deepening US dependence on oil and gas, he is promoting a Green New Deal with major provisions to support a green transition beyond US borders. By driving decarbonisation among US allies in Europe and around the world, Sanders promises to reduce Putin’s geopolitical leverage.Rather than ignoring the illicit financial system, Sanders is advocating a programme of “corporate accountability” to shut down tax havens, eliminate anonymous shell companies and strictly regulate the Wall Street banks that have facilitated the flow of kleptocrats’ cash all around the world.Finally, Sanders avoids the lazy cold war rhetoric about “the Russians” that helps boost Putin’s legitimacy back at home. Instead, his approach is infrastructural, attacking the nodes of the illicit finance network rather than the inidual “bad actors” operating within it.In short, Sanders is shifting away from the antiquated paradigm of “foreign policy” – with its clear demarcations of home and abroad and its appeals to a unified national interest – and towards “foreign politics”. He is targeting the global architecture of kleptocracy in which many US firms and passport holders are complicit, and building ties with social movements around the world that can serve as allies in the fight against state corruption.Progressives cannot afford to be naive in their approach to Putin. His efforts to consolidate a sphere of influence are unlikely to abate, regardless of the 2020 election outcome. But for all the Democratic party’s legitimate fears about Russian aggression, it cannot retreat to an outdated paradigm that approaches Russia as a question of military security alone.It should come as no surprise, therefore, that those who understand Putin’s kleptocratic system – such the leader of the Russian opposition, Alexei Navalny – are now rooting for Sanders. It is only by undermining that system, not competing with it, that the US can truly weaken Putin’s authoritarian grip, and make way for a new democratic movement to flourish in Russia.• Ben Judah is a fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC.

How could it just disappear?I have my first appointment of 2020 with my life coach. Apart from suggesting I take up the xylophone as a relaxing hobby, we look at how I might break my four-hour-a-day phone habit.My life coach agrees that I could get fit AND write my novel, if I stopped scrolling, checking, texting, listening to podcasts, Instagramming, tweeting and reading news all day.His phone is mostly inactive. He just turns it on twice a day to check his messages and speak to clients. The rest of the time it just sits in a drawer on aeroplane mode.“Experiment perhaps with going for a walk without it,” he says. I shudder involuntarily.At home, I Google where to buy a xylophone and find I have just lost an hour mindlessly scrolling. Hate self! Why so addicted to small powerful computer?Leave it in a drawer as I have to get enough sleep because tomorrow I’m going on TV and I want to look HOT and RESTED.Today I am on TV! I’m hardly ever on TV. But the people at Studio 10 want to interview me about detoxes and since I did an extreme one in 2014 I’m an expert.In the city I get my hair blow-dried and makeup done. “Give me a helmet!” I tell the stylist. “I am going on TV.” Hairdresser says nothing, so I say it again in case she didn’t hear. “Lots of spray please – it must be firm for TV!”Others are excited about TV. My parents, sister-in-law and three-year-old niece are gathering at my parents’ house to watch me at 10:30am.Windswept day in Melbourne. Hope helmet stays in place. Get cab to Channel Ten. They promised Cabcharges. Cab is expensive. Spent all money on hair.Run up to reception on level 4 to collect Cabcharges. Leave my laptop in cab as security to reassure driver I won’t do a runner. Cabbie is going to loiter on Toorak Road. I need to be quick. Rain! Laptop! Hair!Reception doesn’t have Cabcharges. Reception rings various people. Sends me to security. Security doesn’t have my name on the list. Who am I? What am I doing here? Why do I want Cabcharges? Reception rings someone called Matt.Matt takes his time (three minutes) to come to reception. Feel sick about driver being towed with my laptop. What if I never see laptop again? Matt has Cabcharges but looks confused.Who am I? What am I doing here? Have I got the wrong week? No! I don’t! Oh maybe I do? “You are not on television today,” he says. “You have made a mistake.”Matt says he’ll come to cab with me to sort out driver. Outside it’s raining. Hair is destroyed – but who cares. I am not on television any more. Must tell excited family or else they will watch Studio 10 all morning, confused, looking for daughter.Where is cab? It has my laptop in it. See cab – it is parked. Then it is … moving. I’m waving frantically – I start to run. I am running along Toorak Road – on the actual road – in the rain with flat hair (not good hair) and Matt is also running and the cab is driving and we catch it and Matt pays for the cab and goes back up to Channel Ten and I sit in a coffee shop across the road from the TV station and text my family (“wrong day, I’m not on telly”) and sit staring at the Channel Ten logo and try not to get upset about the 15 minutes I had good hair and only three people saw it.After catching up with my friend Chris, we split an Uber to Fitzroy, where I’m going to dinner and he’s going on a Tinder date.In the Uber I suddenly panic. “Where’s my phone?? I don’t have my phone!!”Chris has known me for nine years, and although he’s heard secondhand about me losing stuff, he hasn’t actually been there – in the eye of the storm.Immediately he’s ready, like a sniper.He starts ringing my phone. No sound.“I got sand in it and it doesn’t ring,” I explain.He grabs my backpack and starts unzipping all the areas and plunging his hand in trying to find the phone while also apologising for going through my bag, but I can see he’s actually panicked. I tip my handbag on to the seat, freaking out.Chris finds the phone in a weird side pocket.“What the hell is it doing there?”Chris literally slumps back in the seat and shakes his head. “It’s stressful to be you.”I have dinner with Osman Faruqi. He tells me not to worry about not being on television because there is always a chance something could go terribly wrong live on air, which would ruin my career and reputation. I could become some sort of infamous meme, and that is all I am known for for the rest of my life and it’s the top line of my obituary.“So it’s a good thing you didn’t get on TV.”After dinner, Os is going to a bar in the city. I’m going home. It is raining hard. My hair will be even flatter. Outside the pub someone is calling my name. The cries are coming from the ground. I look down and it’s Chris and his Tinder date, sitting on the ground under a ledge where the kegs are rolled. They are vaping in the rain.I’m so thrown by this (what are they doing here? Why are they sitting on the ground?) that I almost miss my Uber. Check phone. Check number plate. I say goodbye to Chris and say hello to Nick, my driver.On the journey home we talk about energy-efficient air conditioners. Nick is a great guy. Five stars.Twitter time! At home I search my bag and backpack and realise with a terrible, sick feeling my phone is missing. Like missing missing. Really missing.Find my phone is turned off. Uber driver can only be contacted by phone. But I have no phone!! DM Os on Twitter.“I lost my phone!”Os tries ringing it, but I tell him there’s no point because it got sand stuck in it in 2015 and doesn’t ring.“Are you on your laptop? Try that to see where it is. Otherwise give me your Apple ID and I can try to log in,” suggest Os.I get Os to phone Nick, the driver.“Hmm he says he can’t find it. Pulled over and had a good look. Maybe it’s in the pub? I don’t understand how you could have lost it between the pub and your house. You must’ve had it to call Uber.”I message Chris and tell him that my phone is really gone. If he’s still at the Napier could he have a look … on the ground?“This is absurd! You had it in hand when you left.”It is absurd. It was in my hands. It was 8:30pm and I’d been drinking mineral water.How could it have just disappeared?Distressed, I contemplate life without it. In the void, I see a xylophone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4386694bb142233cdc7cf86848018728b4161e/0_0_3072_1866/master/3072.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1971327c21257e9dcf339f2c1d797b23 1880w","title":"students join manchester university staff on the picket line","story":"Students in Manchester express solidarity with ‘overworked, underpaid’ staffEarly on Thursday morning, striking staff and supportive students braved wind, rain and hailstones to picket at the University of Manchester, demanding an end to unequal pay, unfair workloads, rising pension costs and the casualisation of work.Outside the Samuel Alexander building, Spanish lecturers Adriana Bausells and Rubén Peinado said the precariousness of pay and contracts had become the norm for their department, increasing their workloads and stymieing prospects for promotion.Peinado, 34, is on his fourth fixed-term contract in four years, which has seriously affected his income and economic security. “Every year I’m offered a contract renewal for only 10 months ‘to satisfy a temporary need in the department’. I get my last paycheque in June, then nothing until the end of September.“How do you say to your landlord that you have no job over the summer so can’t pay rent for two months? I go back to Spain, come back in September, then a few months in I’ll get a letter saying I’m no longer needed and the process starts again. It makes you feel really, really bad.” Bausells, 33, said she also had to move home three times in the last five years for this reason.“When it comes to teaching it makes it so hard to innovate, because you don’t know if you’ll see these students next year. Last year was my first time seeing students graduate and the feeling was amazing – I’ve seen them from first year through their final year. It’s a brilliant but rare opportunity nowadays.”Postdoctoral student Rebecca said the systemic casualisation of work and pay marginalised people from less privileged backgrounds. “It’s driving lots of people out of academia who can’t afford to be on temporary contracts and constantly looking for the next job, which is really bad for ersity.”She will be back on the job market next year looking for permanent lectureships that she’s unlikely to find. “I’ve spent 10 years training for a career in academia, but I’ve seen so many colleagues who couldn’t find permanent work have to leave the sector altogether.”Taking shelter by the Whitworth Building, students directed frustration towards university management. For third-year philosophy and politics student Orlando Phipps, this was his third consecutive term having lectures cancelled because of industrial action. “I’m here out of concern for my lecturers – they don’t take these decisions lightly – and to stand up to the financialisation of higher education.”Several staff members cited that by increasing pension costs, the Universities Superannuation Scheme was ignoring the recommendations of two joint expert panels that deemed it unnecessary.English and American studies professor Jackie Stacey said younger colleagues wouldn’t have a pension they could live on when they retire under the changes. She also found her workload unmanageable. “The volume of work is way too high and impossible to do in the hours that we’re paid for. University management has literally no idea what our day-to-day lives are like.”Monica Pearl, lecturer in 20th century American literature, added that work-life balance was non-existent. “For some of us, we’re on the picket lines in the morning but afterwards we might finally get to go to the dentist or get our eyes examined. I just couldn’t do those things during the semester, because I’m working all the time.”Daniela Caselli and John McAuliffe have both taught at the university for about 15 years and have seen a shift toward investing in regeneration of buildings, development of new parts of the campus and overseas expansion, rather than in staff, teaching and research.“We should work 37.5 hours a week, but it’s actually more like 60 or 70,” Caselli said. “We want to do our job well, but I feel constantly put in a position where I perform not at my best.”English literature lecturer Chris Vardy said the only way to secure a more permanent role was to do research on the side, which you’re not paid for, and “compounds the problem of workload more and more as I have to work far beyond the hours I’m paid for”.As the picket came to an end and with the rain finally letting up, Pearl added, “None of us wants to be on strike. It’s the last resort. It’s against our ethos as teachers. We want to teach – but we’re broken by the work conditions before us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca57c8b83b670c3d9c7ca2996e031894ff05bbc/0_106_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b41ce7ec4f643926cdea06ab4b4b4f6d","title":"thousands of university workers strike across uk","story":"Academic and support staff take action over pay, pensions and working conditionsUniversity workers have formed picket lines on campuses across the UK on the first day of the “biggest-ever wave of strikes” over higher education pay, pensions and working conditions.The University and College Union (UCU) reported that support from staff and students remained solid, despite the fact it will be the third time university staff have gone on strike in the last three years – most recently just before Christmas.UCU branches across the country posted pictures of lively picket lines at universities in Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, Essex, Newcastle and Cardiff among others, and there were messages of solidarity from politicians including the Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “Labour stands in solidarity with striking university workers today. They are on strike due to the failed marketised system created under the Tories.“They don’t do so lightly. Reasonable terms and conditions and fair pensions are the minimum they should expect, and their treatment is a stark contrast to the eye-watering pay packets of a few vice-chancellors.”Up to 50,000 lecturers, technicians, librarians and other academic and support staff at 74 universities will take part in a total of 14 days of strike action, staggered through February and March, which will potentially affect about 1.2 million students through lost lectures and tutorials. Many have expressed their support for staff, but are pushing for compensation from university managers.In south London, students sipping cups of “solidaritea” joined staff at Goldsmiths University of London on picket lines outside the Richard Hoggart building. “The workload is simply becoming unsustainable for many in the profession,” said Philippa Burt, a theatre and performance lecturer.Wearing a high-vis vest and brandishing leaflets, Burt said that while there were specific demands from the UCU, many had joined the picket lines because of concern about a general decline in working conditions. She said her timetable, under which she works six days a week but is only paid for four and a half, is typical across the profession.“We’ve seen pay cuts alongside an exponential growth in workload,” added another senior lecturer, who did not want to be named.Many of those on the Goldsmiths picket said the current strike, which follows an eight-day walkout shortly before Christmas, was the result of universities refusing to negotiate with the UCU. Employers, however, insist they have gone a long way to meet union demands.A UCEA spokesperson said: “It will take time for universities to find out exactly how many scheduled classes have not taken place on a given day. Feedback also points to mixed support and impact across the minority of UK universities affected by the strikes, and each university is of course focused on managing this period of disruption as best they can for their students.”One lecturer at Goldsmiths said: “They’ve consistently reneged on their promises and have failed to consult us every step of the way. And we’ll be here again in a few months if we have to be.”A theatre lecturer on the picket line, who did not want to be identified, disputed the employers’ claim earlier this week that pay increases and better working patterns were not financially viable. “The money always seems to be there for capital investment but never for the wellbeing of staff or students.”A fine-art lecturer with 15 years’ experience said she initially supported the protests in December because of the proposed increase in pensions contributions by staff, but that recent cuts and a reorganisation of her department had attracted others to the cause.“This is part of a wider move towards marketisation of higher education,” she said. “They’re taking away our autonomy and the result is that we’re working longer hours for less.”Zoe Sanders, a student in the art department, gave the lecturers her full backing. “Their demands for better working conditions are also demands for better learning conditions.”The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “We have been receiving news of solid support for the strikes across the UK. That support sends a clear message to universities that, instead of focusing on silly games and spinning in the run up to the walkouts, they should have been working with us to try and sort things out.“We have been clear that we are always ready to seriously discuss all the issues at the heart of the disputes. Students are understandably unimpressed at the intransigence of their university leaders and have made clear demands today that vice-chancellors and principals work harder to try and resolve the disputes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd9b41bbaf5c61bc029e4fe48485e5b8a48e474/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f5ea292485d37e9f08461ded47135cf","title":"ucl to ban intimate relationships between staff and students univesities","story":" finds only two other UK universities have a ban, with another introducing oneUniversity College London has become the first Russell Group university to introduce a ban on romantic and sexual relationships between lecturers and their students.UCL said the personal relationships policy would protect against potential abuses of power and conflicts of interest.The policy prohibits “close personal and intimate relationships between staff and students where the staff member has a direct responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s academic studies andor personal welfare”.It also obliges staff to declare a close personal or intimate relationship with any other student, who they do not directly supervise, within a month or face disciplinary action.The policy says staff should “maintain an appropriate physical and emotional distance from students”.Staff should try to “avoid creating special friendships with students, as this may be seen as grooming” should only contact students via official university channels and should try to avoid giving their personal mobile phone number, or meeting students outside the university.All other staff will also be required to disclose close personal or intimate relationships with other members of staff where the relationship may present a conflict of interest.The policy also prohibits staff from close and intimate relationships with “at risk” adults, which could include people with a disability, whether they are students or other staff, and with students or staff under 18.Kelsey Paske, the behaviour and culture change manager at UCL, said the ban was informed by “the need to recognise positions of power and power imbalances within higher education settings, and to help prevent abuses of power”. Paske added: “The decision to prohibit certain relationships was centred on protecting both students and staff.”Paske said the ban was inspired by those in place at Ivy League universities in the US, such as Princeton, Harvard and Yale.Rachel Watters, the women’s officer for the National Union of Students, said: “Given the public focus on sexual misconduct in higher education and elsewhere, we would hope and expect more universities to revise their policies in similar ways.”Only two other UK universities, Greenwich and Roehampton, have bans on sexual relationships between lecturers and their students, a  investigation has found. It is understood that another university is in the process of implementing a ban.The investigation, in which freedom of information requests were issued to 122 universities, found only seven members of staff had been disciplined by universities for relationships with students in the past five years.Although 97 universities have policies on relationships between staff and students, many only discourage them.Dr Anna Bull of the 1752 Group, which campaigns against sexual misconduct by university staff, said: “UCL’s new policy is the most stringent in the UK. If it is implemented as intended, it will help to enable a safer and more gender equal teaching and learning environment.”She said the lack of similar policies in other universities suggested they were “not taking seriously the risks associated with the power imbalances between staff and students”.Last month, Natasha Caruana, a lecturer at the University of the Arts London, said she had resigned from her previous university, the University for the Creative Arts, owing to concerns about inappropriate relationships between staff and students.“I stood up for what I knew was the correct and ethical way of behaving,” she wrote on Instagram. “There is a rich history of male academics having special friendships with female students … and it won’t change until more of us call it out and put pressure on universities to change their policies.” A spokesperson for the University for the Creative Arts said: “We wholeheartedly reject the picture as presented in the social media post. UCA has robust policies in place to protect the wellbeing of our students and staff. We have acted – and will continue to act – swiftly and decisively whenever we receive allegations of improper conduct.”A Department for Education spokesman said: “We take any form of harassment in universities extremely seriously, and expect universities to have robust policies and procedures.”A 2018 survey by the 1752 Group and the NUS found that four-fifths of students said they were uncomfortable with staff having relationships with students, which they described as “predatory”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a763fc457086892c97607e8e737f60471fdd424/0_34_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35212308eca10e00e8bb2885f468dd27","title":"miuccia prada pleated midi skirt is here to stay","story":"House’s show featured leg-baring strips of fabric in a strong narrative about women and powerThe pleated midi skirt - ubiquitous in modern wardrobes over the past decade - is not going anywhere for autumnwinter, according to Miuccia Prada. Her latest show, in Milan on Thursday, deconstructed the trend, however, with a selection of swishy, leg-baring calf-length skirts fashioned from silken tassels and chunky strips of fabric.“Basically the pleated skirt became fringing,” the designer said after her show, “because I wanted to use fringe as a symbol.”It was a cracking collection which came with a clear narrative about women and power. Those skirts were combined with severe grey suit jackets, shirts and ties - business at the top, cocktail hour at the bottom.Towards the end of the show the office-appropriate pieces, in grey, camel and black, were remade in tulle or embellished with crystals. Vivid coloured tights - grass green, sky blue and yolk yellow - peeked out as models strode forward. The final looks were silken suits decorated with graphic floral prints. The impression was of an army of corporate drones whose fabulous inner selves were bursting to reveal themselves.In line with the current movement towards longevity in trends it made a subtle departure from the previous season rather than rethinking it.Afterwards Prada explained that she wanted to use the collection to make a case for glamour as part of daytime dressing. “It is the quintessential cliche of what is considered femininity - sparkles, fringing, embroidery,” she said, arguing that when toughness and softness are combined, women are their strongest.The catwalk was dominated by a plywood sculpture of Atlas - the titan who in Greek mythology was condemned to hold up for heavens for all eternity. Certainly, Prada has a lot on her plate too. She is a fashion legend - the designer who has launched a thousand global trends - but in recent years the company’s financial performance has not matched its cultural impact.There have also been rumours swirling that Raf Simons - the acclaimed former creative director of Calvin Klein and Dior - might join the Prada group in some capacity which, trade publication Business of Fashion reports, Prada has declined to comment on.Earlier this month Prada reached a settlement with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The commission had been investigating the brand since 2018, when photographs of a series of figurines which recalled blackface imagery, taken in the front of Prada’s New York store, went viral on social media. Afterwards Prada apologised, withdrew the items and established a ersity council, with members including filmmaker Ava Duvernay.The agreement reached with the New York City Commission goes further, however, insisting all employees are given sensitivity training and requiring the installation of a ersity and inclusion officer to vet all designs “before they are sold, advertised or promoted in any way in the United States.” The decision could have ramifications for the industry at large – the commission is currently in talks with other brands, including Gucci, about similar missteps – and is a rare example of government intervention in a fashion brand’s practices.• This article was amended on 20 February 2020 to correct a bearingbaring homophone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60279cfb69c5c5da24657ae1173929915fbde2a7/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d86d40068ce12676fe82f1f6976cb42f","title":"why owning fewer clothes makes you a better dresser","story":"There is a sartorial magic to the kind of streamlined wardrobe made famous by Audrey Hepburn and Sade. Here’s how to master itThe capsule wardrobe has always been cool. The capsule wardrobe is Françoise Hardy and Sade. It is Audrey Hepburn and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. It is all the heady intoxication of fashion with no hangover of buyer’s remorse. It is a magic pill to streamline your wardrobe, so no more tying yourself in knots figuring out what to wear.OK, so here’s the thing: as we all agree a capsule wardrobe is such a great idea, why don’t we actually dress like this? I’ve never nailed it and I know a lot of very fabulous, cool, clever women and most of them haven’t either. But 2020 might just be the year that is going to change. Because capsule dressing is no longer the sensible option, the one you know you should commit to, if only you didn’t keep getting your head turned by newer, more daring, more exciting, more instantly desirable clothes. In 2020, capsule dressing is where the newest, most daring, most exciting, most instantly desirable fashion is happening.Sustainability is aspirational. Zoolanderish, yes, but also true. If sustainability means that we as a species get to continue living on this planet, then that seems to me to pretty much sum up our wishlist right now. A fabulous capsule wardrobe is the sustainable way – which is to say the modern way – to raise your fashion game. You can tell that sustainability has become glamorous because outfit repeating – which used to be something that normal people did all the time but fancy people wouldn’t be seen dead doing, sort of like getting the bus – has now become a badge of honour. Meghan Markle rewears dresses, Joaquin Phoenix sticks with one Stella McCartney tux through red carpet season.The tagline of Wardrobe NYC, the front row’s current favourite label, is “luxury without excess”. Founded by designer Josh Goot and fashion director Christine Centenera, Wardrobe NYC is “the ultimate wardrobe for those with shared values and aesthetic”, which translates as pared-down urban minimalism designed in New York and made in Italy. The aesthetic is radically minimalist, but the price tag is seriously upscale, with £1,500 buying you a four-piece wardrobe, delivered as a set of blazer, shirt, T-shirt and leggings – just choose from black or white, and click your size. (It’s like a HelloFresh box, but with everything you need to look cool rather than to make dinner.) A four-piece, pared-back, day-to-night wardrobe commanding a price point usually ruled by the fancy party dress speaks volumes about the status of the capsule wardrobe right now.With sustainability non-negotiable, we who love fashion are finding ways to tease our passion apart from overconsumption. As the world heats, capsule dressing looks cooler than ever. A streamlined wardrobe frees a little more of your time, your sanity – and the world’s resources. “A capsule wardrobe isn’t just quicker,” Hornby says. “It’s better.”  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

So it has proved with this bafflingly insipid, zestless, derivative film – a simperingly coy knock-off of The Devil Wears Prada without the sexiness and fun, and so wet that in the immortal words of Molesworth, you could shoot snipe off it.It is based on Joanna Rakoff’s 2014 memoir My Salinger Year, all about her temp job at the New York literary agency Harold Ober Associates in the 90s, when she was entrusted with the banal but also near-sacred task of dealing with the fan letters sent to the agency’s most famous and reclusive client: JD Salinger – sifting through them for dangerous weirdos, sending out the standard brush-off reply, and making sure that no one finds out his home address. Rakoff had her own privileged encounter with the great man, experiencing the global love he inspired and inspires, and got a new perspective on what it means to love writers, writing and reading. The story was first developed as a wry, witty piece for BBC Radio 4, then as a widely enjoyed book. Canadian film-maker Philippe Falardeau has adapted Rakoff’s book and directs.Margaret Qualley (the jailbait “Pussycat” who gets a ride from Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) plays Joanna, the wide-eyed ingenue with a college education who somehow blags a job at a top literary agency, working for the formidable Margaret, played by Sigourney Weaver – Salinger’s agent and intimate friend. Margaret is cantankerous, demanding, hilariously opposed to computers she is sometimes gently tolerant of Joanna and sometimes really mean. Joanna is given the Salinger fan-letter task, even heart-stoppingly taking his calls – and his correspondents’ earnest personal messages are wearyingly dramatised in monologues direct to camera. Joanna begins to wonder if she might break the rules and schoolmarmishly respond to one or two. Meanwhile, she has boyfriend worries and dares to visit Margaret at her home.The provincial-making-it-in-the-big-city genre is well established, but the influence of The Devil Wears Prada is so clear it almost begins to feel like a upscale homage. It suffers in comparison because The Devil Wears Prada is forthright and funny with Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep delivering fireworks. Perhaps Qualley and Weaver could have done the same with a sparkier script. But the all-important master-servant hero-worship dynamic is always stymied: erted on to the semi-unseen and necessarily unresponsive Salinger.The film is stuck with a kind of gaze-averting solemnity when it comes to the star of the show, who can never be seen, just glimpsed. This arguably reflects Joanna’s subservient relationship, but it means we never get any insight into Salinger beyond the thwarted-fan view and there is no real insight into her or Margaret either. The only way is up for Berlin 2020 now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01417c80784096ddf8ed5f314bb6175963b6acad/0_333_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d51374d5ddca4e551d98dad7e4d996dc","title":"the great snack divide should you eat three square meals a day or 17 tiny ones","story":"Scientists are split on how often we should eat. Personally, I always have food in my pockets – fine when it’s rice cakes, less so when it’s cheeseThat is what I have always done – what I like. There is some method behind it: I suspect rigid three-meal-a-day people of secretly enjoying the thrill of being hungry. There is something performative in their self-denial. I don’t know why this annoys me as much as it does, but it has resulted in me eating a lot of pork scratchings. Fasting, which is popular at the moment, suggests leaving a gap of some kind between one food adventure and the next, but I am not sure that eschewing food for as few as four or six hours counts as a fast.Nibbling worked fine for me as a sole trader, but then I produced young, who also did what I liked, which meant: “Eat whenever you are hungry, whatever time it is.” This has been going on for 12 years. Its upsides are straightforward: whenever you are hungry, you eat. But are there any downsides?There is a critical problem with variety. Cooking dinner is an undertaking, if only a 20-minute one. Even if we make the same things repeatedly, everyone does some basic cabin checks (in this analogy, the cabin is your stomach): did I have sausages last night? When did I last have a green vegetable? Is there more to life than pasta? It would defeat the object of a snack if you thought about it for even 20 seconds, so you always end up having the same thing. It is almost never an apple. It tends to be made of carbs, as they are the most portable. Let’s just admit it: it is always crisps. The furthest concession to health I will make is a sour cream and chive lentil twist – and that is a vanishingly rare event. It is so often a Pringle that I think I am Martha Stewart when I remember to buy Popchips. I have created such a strong crisp norm that anything not-crisps is considered a health food, even when it is a hash brown.Sweets fit uncomfortably into the snack arc, since they are obviously a treat, yet at the same time they are the size of a snack. So I have moulded what should be a big-ticket sugar item into yet another miniature in the minibar of snack life.People who snack never finish a full meal, which is annoying when you have cooked that meal, but not as bad as the ascent into adulthood, when you still snack constantly, but discover you can also manage a full meal. The only food you can eat constantly without ill effect is hay – and even then only if you are a rabbit.My pockets are always full of random food, which is fine when it is a rice cake, but not when it is cheese. A huge amount of plastic goes into the process of separating foods into snack sizes, which then ends up in my pocket as well. I walk around making a crinkling noise, as if I am wearing a cheap clown costume.Just as you would never put your whole mind to choosing a snack, so no one ever concentrates on eating one. This lowers the ceiling of eating pleasure – although I wonder how high that ceiling is in the first place when you are talking about a Pringle – and means that you eat too fast. There was a huge movement in the early 00s around chewing every mouthful 32 times (when I say “huge movement”, I mean “two articles”) this has ancient digestive benefits, its proponents said, breaking down the food so thoroughly at the start of its journey that the rest of your tract didn’t have to work so hard. It didn’t catch on, because it was boring and a bit bovine, but the space between 32 times and “inhaling your food while doing something else” is probably the one we should inhabit.There are times when we go paleo, but without the raw meat – technically, this makes it a pre-paleo diet – and live on nuts and berries, with the odd edamame bean. This feels great for the 15 minutes that it lasts. Overall, snacking is the most disruptive domestic issue I have encountered – and I am orced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a983be655af78b016f8a7fbd3235ffe78a523c08/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59b2db8dc0fda7d5021139bc15deaa8a","title":"anthony martial puts manchester united in driving seat against brugge","story":"Manchester United stuttered throughout this tepid affair yet still remain favourites to reach the last 16 at the expense of Club Brugge in next week’s return leg.Towards the end here snow fell, replacing the rain, on a night when each side was frozen in a deep below-par state. While Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side have the away goal, whether United possess the talent and skill to win this competition for a second time in four seasons is doubtful.“It was a difficult game against a well organised team in difficult conditions,” said the manager. “I don’t think it was one of the best games.”Solskjær made six changes for this second of three games in seven days, with Anthony Martial leading a 3-4-2‑1, while Philippe Clement’s side had the former Liverpool No 1 Simon Mignolet behind a 5-3-2.United’s win at Chelsea on Monday was the perfect way to commence the closing phase of the campaign following the winter break. The question, though, remained the same: might it finally initiate a formidable run of form that has been elusive since the beginning of Solskjær’s tenure. They started well, but that would prove a false augury in a half when United were largely dismal until the last 10 minutes.From kick-off Nemanja Matic hit Diogo Dalot with a diagonal along the right and his flick was collected inside Brugge’s area by Martial. Moments later United had a scare, though. Brandon Williams missed a challenge, enabling Emmanuel Bonaventure to advance towards Sergio Romero in the United goal. When the ball found Hans Vanaken, Brugge’s captain seemed certain to score, but Matic intervened and the danger fizzled out.United threatened again via a sequence that began with Victor Lindelöf and Dalot exchanging passes inside their half and featured a contribution from Luke Shaw before Andreas Pereira’s shot was saved by Mignolet low to his left. Now, the Brugge goalkeeper was about to have a prime role in United conceding.Matic overran the ball to give Brugge a goal-kick. Mignolet took this quickly, hitting a long delivery through the middle. This was collected by Bonaventure, who held off Williams and calmly lobbed the advancing Romero. United immediately claimed to the referee, Aleksei Kulbakov, that Mignolet had hit a moving ball but despite VAR being in use from this round on, the Belarusian was unmoved.Here was a test for United and one that might have become sterner if Mats Rits had not scuffed an attempt near Romero’s goal. United escaped but continued to be vulnerable whenever the home side attacked. Harry Maguire was caught out of position so Percy Tau dropped in behind and from the ensuing play Bonaventure broke the United ranks again. This time Romero saved his shot at a tight angle from close in.The home crowd was in raucous voice. When Shaw’s pass put Maguire under pressure close to his goal, the captain bought a foul by falling as Tau approached and the spectators were in uproar.Solskjær may have looked at Bruno Fernandes on the bench and decided his midfield poise was required. United were poor, embodied by Maguire scooping a regulation pass straight out. Yet from this error United equalised. Maxim De Cuyper aimed his throw-in at Brandon Mechele near halfway but the centre-back dozed, Martial stole the ball, swooped towards Mignolet and finished for a fine solo strike to follow his opener at Chelsea.Martial’s 14th of the season silenced the stadium aside from the travelling support and he came close to adding another. Once more his skill fashioned him space and he was unlucky to see a left-foot shot from a 20-yard angle rebound off Mignolet’s left post, the keeper’s fingertips saving his side.United started the second half brightly but as with the first faded. First, Juan Mata fed Dalot and his curving cross came close to creating a chance for Martial. Then Mata slipped in the Frenchman but when he should have shot he tried a return ball to the Spaniard and the move broke down.From here any quality seeped from the contest – each side proving bereft of a spark. On show was a hodgepodge of mistimed touches and passes.Solskjær put on Odion Ighalo, Fred and Fernandes for the last phase of the match and though no real upturn occurred in his brief cameo the last of these managed four shots – the most for United, which was indicative of how poor they were.“He made a difference in 10 minutes,” Solskjær said, after a night that will not be long remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809aec486184ee87d4f027400ff45937bfbec33e/79_104_3751_2251/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59e0dcb4c25817873e5861984bbc03d","title":"lacazette silences olympiakos match report europa league","story":"In Greece’s port city, Mikel Arteta could be forgiven for thinking his ship had come in. He had asked his young Arsenal players to block out the heat generated by the raucous, relentless atmosphere that makes this one of Europe’s most difficult venues for the uninitiated and their response, after an unnerving start, formed the latest step in the increasingly convincing revolution that is breathing life into a troubled campaign.Olympiakos had begun as if determined to blow their opponents away and, in doing so, stop Arsenal’s hopes of Champions League qualification in their tracks. Winning this competition seems, by some way, their best chance of returning to the top table but for 15 minutes they were rabbits in the headlights and the priority at that point was simply to stay in the tie. They did that with steadily increasing levels of assurance and then, nine minutes from time, scored a goal that may look especially significant by the end of May.It was tapped in by Alexandre Lacazette, whose return to some kind of form is a welcome footnote, but the conversation afterwards centred upon its architect. Bukayo Saka, a reluctant left-back who just happens to have the hallmarks of an exceptional one, had endured a frustrating night in possession or, more accurately, through the lack of it. His teammates had rarely picked out his bursts upfield but then, after doing superbly to keep a diagonal ball in play, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang spotted him darting inside and into space. The attribute that will, perhaps above all others, propel Saka to the top is his final ball this one was low, curving and weighted in such a way that Lacazette could not miss and the biggest compliment one can give is that such accuracy was entirely unsurprising.Saka turned 18 in September and would, all things equal, much rather be playing further forwards. But he has now made nine assists this season, more than any other Arsenal player, and his ability to break the lines at searing pace from deep must make the temptation to nurture him in the full-back role almost irresistible.“There’s a lot of highlights on him at the moment but he’s really humble,” Arteta said. “He’s a great kid and he’s very brave. He makes big decisions in the final third, he doesn’t hide and he’s got the vision and ability to execute in spaces that are really tight, which is a big gift.”The game had been begging for that moment of quality. Arteta was right to point out Arsenal were tormented in those early moments, suffering because “we did not do the things we talked about and the execution on the simple things was poor”.Olympiakos, who had held Spurs here before dropping out of the Champions League group stage, were intense and insistent even if those qualities did not translate into many clear chances.Mathieu Valbuena did force an early save from Bernd Leno, for whom a rare European outing was hard evidence of the importance Arteta has placed upon this competition, and then delivered a teasing cross that Giorgos Masouras headed off target at close quarters. Masouras was fortunate to be flagged marginally offside but the red and white waves kept crashing into Arsenal’s backline, Leno having to spare David Luiz an own goal while another impressive left-back, Kostas Tsimikas, caused problems with his own forward runs. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200220-55871-gnl.fw.20200220.jf.brugge.mp3 Yet there was always something in this for Arsenal, even if for most of the game it lay just out of view. Lacazette missed their best two first-half chances, failing to make contact with Aubameyang’s cross and then flashing wide when he should have buried a cutback from Gabriel Martinelli. They rarely looked composed enough in possession to create much more, even though Matteo Guendouzi – recalled after a disagreement with Arteta during the winter break – and the impressive Joe Willock began to cleave through midfield with increasing frequency before the interval.Much of the second half was best forgotten. Olympiakos’s sting had ultimately been drawn with relative ease although they had looked marginally the more likely winners in the moments before Lacazette’s goal, Valbuena finding his range from a succession of cheaply conceded set pieces and coming particularly close when forcing Leno to make a sprawling save from a 25-yard free-kick.Arteta was as pleased with a third consecutive clean sheet, an almost unthinkable prospect when he took over, as anything else. “We tell them they have to enjoy defending as well,” he said. “It’s a big part of the game and, like tonight, if you give simple balls away you’d better run back and get that ball back as quickly as possible. But they play with a big heart.”Had things been in even better working order at the other end, Arsenal might have extended their lead late on and virtually killed the tie. Lacazette was denied well by José Sá and Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who was briefly confronted by a home fan when he left the field in added time, headed against the bar.“The tie is completely open,” Arteta said and the possibility of a happy end to a seemingly accursed season has now exposed itself to Arsenal too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4473c4d72f3608c2217b892e31ebf33bc373b1e3/0_71_4968_2980/master/4968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f3480ec0cf36ab56e104e084f5335f9","title":"manchester city offer an olive branch now uefa holds all the power","story":"Now the City case has gone to Cas, Uefa has the chance to weigh in on the CFCB’s decision. Ferran Soriano’s change of tone gives it something to ponderManchester City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, mostly repeated the club’s previous forthright statements when he gave his interview to the club’s TV platform on Wednesday, but the content was different in one particular area. As expected, he denied as “simply not true” the finding that the club seriously breached financial fair play rules by overstating its Abu Dhabi sponsorships between 2012 and 2016, for which City have been handed a two-year Champions League ban and €30m (£25m) fine. But suddenly there were complimentary and diplomatic words for Uefa, contradicting City’s consistently ferocious anti-Uefa approach, and that provided a pointer to where the case is heading.In a very significant detail, as City appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas), the process changes now. For all City’s previous rhetoric against Uefa, the guilty finding and sanction were not in fact reached by Uefa itself, but by its club financial control body (CFCB), which administers FFP compliance.Following good governance practice to encourage independent application of the rules, the CFCB and its members have nothing to do with any other Uefa work, although by definition they have to be appointed by Uefa and are assisted clerically by its officials. The structure follows European governance models, with two separate panels to consider cases.The investigatory chamber (IC) examines clubs’ financial details, and brings charges if it considers them necessary. These charges are taken to the adjudicatory chamber (AC), composed of senior European lawyers, which acts like a first court, hearing the IC’s case and City’s defence, then reaching a ruling. The right of appeal to Cas is built in, so all CFCB members know their work can ultimately be independently reviewed and publicised. But at this point Uefa, the organisation itself, with its president Aleksander Ceferin, becomes involved it defends the rulings of its CFCB at Cas.City ignored that distinction between Uefa and its CFCB in their furious statement when the AC’s ruling was announced last Friday. The club’s hierarchy denounced Uefa itself: the process was “flawed” and “prejudicial”, and was all Uefa’s fault. “Simply put, this is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa.”Soriano reversed that in his comments five days later, noticeably highlighting the difference, saying the CFCB “is not Uefa”. He now blamed the “FFP chamber” – although he referred only to the IC, not the AC – claiming it was “less about justice and more about politics”. For Uefa itself, there was unexpected praise. “The experience with this FFP IC has been negative for us, more than what I would have imagined,” he said. “But this is not Uefa.“We are not talking about the whole of Uefa, which is an association of associations. I personally know many people that work at Uefa, very hard for the benefit of Uefa, but also for the benefit of the clubs of Uefa like ours, but also for the benefit of football. If the negative experience that we had and the way this process went is negative, it is negative also for them. Uefa is much bigger than this FFP chamber.”This is a major shift, from alleging Uefa was a biased prosecutor, judge and jury, to blaming the FFP chamber and pointing out the many good people he knows at Uefa – which of course he does given his long involvement at City and previously Barcelona.The reality is that the process, as it goes on appeal to Cas, has become political for the first time. Ceferin and his officials have responsibility for the case. When the IC decided to charge City, under the CFCB system the AC could not make a settlement it had to hear the charges and decide whether they were proven. The AC members who did find City guilty of “serious breaches” and imposed the severe sanction are very experienced European lawyers, of a similar seniority to any who will sit at Cas.They include the leading London barrister Charles Flint, a QC for 25 years, Christiaan Timmermans, former deputy director-general of the European Commission’s legal service then for 10 years a judge at the European Court of Justice, and the chairman, José Narciso da Cunha Rodrigues, a former Portuguese general prosecutor. City have not made it clear on what basis they allege that these distinguished legal figures prejudged the case for reasons of “politics” rather than a genuine examination of the evidence.Internal City emails published by Der Spiegel in November 2018, which prompted the CFCB investigation, did suggest that Mansour substantially paid the £67.5m sponsorship stated to be from the Abu Dhabi airline Etihad. However, as the AC’s ruling will not be published until Cas issues its decision, it is not known whether this formed part of the charges or guilty finding. When announcing the AC’s decision, Uefa said that City had been found to have “committed serious breaches of FFP regulations by overstating its sponsorship revenue”. It is not clear whether it was part of the CFCB’s case that Mansour put the money in, or just that it did not all come from Etihad.It lands on Uefa now to decide whether to fully support the CFCB’s findings and sanction, and argue at Cas that it must stand. Alternatively, it is open to Uefa for the first time to reach a settlement, drop some of the issues or seek a lighter punishment.Some observers point to two cases Uefa settled at Cas, and are wondering whether it might do the same with City. In March last year Uefa agreed with Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, who had appealed on a technical point about time limits, that the IC could not reinvestigate its sponsorships from Qatari organisations, despite the AC deciding it should. In June Uefa settled with Milan, which set aside the AC’s provisional two-season ban from Uefa competitions, agreeing instead that Milan would be excluded for just this season. Last season the club finished fifth in Serie A, so did not qualify for the Champions League.Others argue that the City decision is so firm, and the sanction so strong, that the credibility of Uefa’s processes, and FFP itself, will be fundamentally damaged if the ruling body does not defend them.Unlike the CFCB, Uefa has constant sporting, commercial and political involvement with the clubs, including City, as Soriano noted. That is why compliance processes are taken out of governing bodies’ core work. Ceferin’s major current concern is the very future of European club football, as top clubs push for an enlarged Champions League against the wishes of leagues, and Fifa seriously advances plans for an expanded Club World Cup.Over the next three or four months it will become clearer whether Uefa sees the City case as a duty which must solemnly be performed, a problem to be managed, or a fudged combination of both. At least Ceferin and his hard-working executives now have some praise from Manchester City to warm them as they consider it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad825c4b386348775b11f95f55679d299367914/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487cb9e1e3611dc2be49342c6a4ee09f","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Olivier Giroud could return to haunt José Mourinho, Norwich need Emi Buendia to shine and Newcastle face a crucial clash“It’s like going to a fight with a gun without bullets.” A manager’s post-match interview is a decent advertisement for the health of his team and the problem for José Mourinho is that his lament after Spurs’ toothless defeat to RB Leipzig will, most likely, apply to the rest of their fixtures this season. Saturday brings something of a level playing field, though, given Chelsea are hardly laden with attacking depth. Tammy Abraham is struggling to be fit and Frank Lampard may have to go again with Michy Batshuayi or, given his good display off the bench against Manchester United, Olivier Giroud. In a parallel universe, Chelsea signed the forwards they wanted in January and allowed Giroud to fill a gaping hole at Tottenham. Instead, nobody feels satisfied and both sides find themselves feeling the heat of rivals making ground beneath them in the race for Champions League places. What price Giroud popping up with the winner – just as he did in a north London derby in 2013 – and forcing Mourinho to bemoan his threadbare set of options again? NA• Chelsea v Tottenham (Saturday, 12.30pm – all times GMT)Watford sparked a mini-resurgence with victory over Manchester United just before Christmas. After four winless matches they could really use another. They could be boosted here by the return of record signing, Ismaila Sarr, whohas been restricted to 11 starts this season. Watford have won four of those, and look a side transformed when they can benefit from the Senegalese forward’s pace and directness on the right. The front three of Sarr, Gerard Deulofeu on the left and Troy Deeney in the middle looks capable of saving the club from relegation should they stay fit, but without any one of that trio the team looks immeasurably poorer.If Watford’s results in those 11 games were extrapolated over a full 38-game season, they would end up with 52 points if their results in 15 matches without him in the starting lineup were mirrored across a season they would finish with 23. SBExactly two months ago, Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti watched their new teams from the Goodison directors’ box and might have been forgiven slipping off to the nearest hostelry well before half-time. The goalless draw was comfortably one of this Premier League season’s worst games but it is not unrealistic to expect far more entertainment from Sunday’s rematch. While both Arsenal and Everton – who endured disastrous first halves of the season – remain deeply flawed, the statistics tell a tale. Between them, the new managers have lost only two of the 16 top-flight games. Both can now glimpse a European place previously out of the question and anyone who takes the three points this time will sense the wind in their sails. Ancelotti’s side, with three wins and two draws from the last five, are in the better form and have not had a Europa League tie in Greece to contend with. But Arsenal showed the right blend of defensive stability and attacking fluency against Newcastle and passing this test would suggest the Arteta revolution does have legs.

The Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has been forced to make 106 saves no one else is in triple figures Newcastle have made 716 clearances, more than 40 more than anyone else. Over their last 10 games Palace have one win and eight points, putting them 19th in the form table Newcastle have two wins (one of which was against Palace) and are 16th. In positive news, Newcastle’s forward line could be boosted by the returns from injury of Yoshinori Muto (seven appearances this season, no shots) and Dwight Gayle (ninetwo). SBThere are people – many of them adults – who deem those seeking to take over football at any cost more likely truth-tellers than an independent body of legal experts with access to relevant evidence. Such is football fandom and such is the loyalty that has been manipulated by multi-billionaires casting themselves as plucky outsiders. Such is politics that we are intimately familiar with the strategy, but these particular circumstances have now changed. It is eminently possible that repurposed outrage inspires an excellent team to become even better – what better way to stick it up Uefa than by winning the Champions League? – but equally possible that righteous indignation becomes distracting. With, er, all due respect to West Ham, a home game against them was unlikely to be revealing, but a visit to Leicester – without a league win over anyone but West Ham since New Year’s Day – will show us plenty about their immediate prospects. DHThere are few portents more troubling for a team than home defeat to West Ham, and that is exactly what happened to Southampton in mid-December to leave them third-bottom. But since then they have been superb, winning at Villa, Chelsea, Leicester and Palace as well as beating Spurs at home, a run which has taken them 12th. Nevertheless they remain just seven points above the relegation zone and they have now gone a month without a win. In Aston Villa, they will find a team not only desperate for points, but one fluid enough to pick the spaces in Southampton’s 4-2-2-2 formation. Saints have lost eight home games so far this season, more than any team in the league, and Ralph Hasenhüttl said this week that the pressure created by the crowd is difficult for his players. This was not wise, because if you offer people an excuse, there’s every chance they will accept it. He and they must acknowledge that no one is responsible for performances, apart from him and them. DHTwelve games left, and Bournemouth are two places and two points outside the bottom three. They have played six of their last seven games against the other members of the bottom six, a run which featured two wins and five defeats, and with their remaining matches including fixtures against eight of the top nine and none of the strugglers. Burnley, on the other hand, still have to play seven of the bottom eight and though they remain – on goal difference – in the bottom half they are just two points off eighth, five from sixth, and their main problem at the moment seems to be in keeping down talk of another European campaign. In Matej Vydra they have a striker who brought a miserable personal run to an end at Southampton last Saturday, his winner meaning he took part in a league victory for the first time this season – at the seventh attempt. SBWolves remainpoised for a tilt at the top four although it is worth pointing out that, since beating Manchester City in December, they have only won once in seven top-flight games. Norwich’s porous defence offers hope that they will put that right, and there is also the fact that Sunday’s visitors desperately require points. Daniel Farke’s team can hardly be accused of not “going for it” and it is hard to think of a more enterprising side that has languished seven points shy of safety at this stage. Their strength is to go hell for leather and that is why, having benched him for the last two games, Farke needs to recall Emi Buendia. The Argentinian can frustrate defensively but his creative gifts are impossible to ignore: he is a chance-creating machine, most measures placing him comfortably in the ision’s top five, and it is hardly his fault that teammates tend to miss a fair chunk of them. It is no exaggeration to say Buendia can weight a through-ball as well as anybody the shackles need to come off now and give Norwich hope of an unlikely escape – even if it also gives Wolves a greater chance of ending their mini barren run. NATo praise Sheffield United is now cliché, and there is no greater praise than that. So, rather than look at what they have done, it is incumbent upon us to look at what they can do: qualify for the Champions League. Currently, they lie sixth, two points off fourth, and the teams immediately above them meet on Saturday. Nor is that all. Chelsea are struggling Spurs, who’ve been sneaking results despite themselves, will be without their two best players until the end of season and so might Manchester United, who sit immediately below them. Which is to say that if Blades remain focused through a run-in that is far from daunting, they have every chance of securing the top-four or top-five finish that would not only rank as one of the great achievements of the Premier League era, but would restore some faith in its legitimacy as a concept. DHDavid Moyes was not wrong to point out, after West Ham’s passive 2-0 defeat at Manchester City, that goal difference could be decisive in the relegation battle. There is little to separate the teams placed between 16th and 19th, in particular, using that metric so it is certainly some consolation that the Hammers avoided a thrashing. But what if they had a bit of a go and asked questions of a side that could have been forgiven for feeling a little distracted? Points are what really matter and Moyes’s side are running out of opportunities. How will they meet the challenge of silencing Anfield by ending Liverpool’s pretensions to domestic invincibility? Realistically we can expect more of the same but it would be refreshing if West Ham decided to test their opponents’ nerve. The title may effectively be sewn up but the pressure to finish undefeated, and perhaps be the best top-flight side of all time, might start playing on the hosts’ minds as the prospect approaches. Liverpool have been far from their best over the past two games, so a competent opponent could yet end the dream.

There, the two comedy icons do what they like to do most these days: chat, eat dinner together and watch the long-running quiz show Jeopardy!“This is a great place because I got friendship, love and free food. Free eats are very important, you know,” says Brooks, as we wait for Reiner in his den. His voice is a little raspier than it once was, but that signature puckishness is fully intact.Brooks knows this home well because Reiner, 97, has lived in it for 60 years. Gene Kelly used to be his neighbour Kirk Douglas, 103, until last month, lived close by. Brooks – a mere whippersnapper of 93 – remembers when Reiner moved in because their friendship predates the house: they have been best friends for 70 years.“Robbie used to sit on the stairs, looking through the banisters, watching us do the 2000 Year Old Man. I’d say, ‘You should be sleeping!’ but he’d just sit there,” says Brooks. (Robbie is better known to those outside the inner Reiner circle as the film director Rob Reiner, Carl’s oldest child and still a baby at 72.)The 2000 Year Old Man is the revered comedy sketch Reiner and Brooks coined in the 1950s, in which Reiner – always playing the straight man – would interview Brooks, the titular old man, about his life. Despite coming from the same time and place as Jesus Christ, the 2000 Year Old Man talked an awful lot like a Jewish guy from 1950s Brooklyn: “I have over 42,000 children and not one of them ever visit me!” was a typical kvetch from Brooks. When Reiner asked what the plague was like, Brooks improvised back, “Too many rats, not enough cats.” Reiner and Brooks made five 2000 Year Old Man albums, winning a Grammy in 1998, and Brooks used to joke, when his films occasionally tanked, that he was living off his and Reiner’s comedy records.But the two friends started the routine as a private joke, something to amuse one another while they were sitting in this living room, and they still do it there today, to make one another laugh.Given that Brooks made Blazing Saddles, The Producers and Young Frankenstein, and Reiner directed The Jerk, Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid and The Man With Two Brains, while little Robbie Reiner on the staircase grew up to make This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, it’s pretty easy to argue that much of the best mid to late 20th-century American comedy emerged from the people currently and formerly in this house.Reiner now appears, notably frailer than Brooks, and walks in slowly with some assistance. “What’s happening here?” he asks uncertainly.“It’s the ! Rupert doesn’t own it, so they can write what they like,” says Brooks.“Oh good, I’m happy. But come close because I sometimes have problems hearing,” says Reiner as he settles into an armchair. Brooks and I huddle in on either side of him.“Now tell her how you met me,” says Brooks, making the kind of loving prompt a wife would give her ailing husband, urging him to tell the anecdotes he has told a thousand times, and hoping he’ll tell them a thousand more.“I remember it very well. It was 1950 …” begins Reiner. Some of his faculties may be fading, but his love of storytelling is undimmed.Brooks and Reiner were both born in New York, second-generation Jewish immigrants. America was made by immigrants, but it was these children of immigrants who helped to define Jewish-American comedy, with its mix of joyful silliness and whaddya-gonna-do shrugs.“My dad invented clocks that run on batteries and he thought: ‘I’m gonna make a fortune!’” says Reiner, pointing to a battery-operated clock on a side table, barely visible among the dozens of century-ning family photos. “But then the war started, the Germans took the patent and they flooded the market.”“So really, we lost the war,” says Brooks with (of course) perfect comic timing.Why do they think so many comedians were – and are –Jewish? “Well, back when we started there weren’t that many jobs for Jews. It was either the garment centre, sports or comedy,” says Brooks.“I think Jews were naturally funny because they were low on the totem pole, so they made fun of the people higher on the pole,” says Reiner.“Oh yeah, that’s good. Carl’s very quick. He’s going to be 98 in March and he’s quicker than anybody,” says Brooks.They met working on Sid Caesar’s TV variety show, Your Show of Shows. (Other writers who worked for Caesar included Neil Simon and, later, Woody Allen, both of whom also played no small part in the coining of Jewish-American comedy.)“I’ll never forget it. I came in one day and I heard this guy say: ‘I’m a Jewish pirate. You know what they’re charging for sails these days? $33.72 a yard! I can’t afford to rape and pillage any more!’ I thought, who is this guy?” says Reiner, eyes widening at the memory. “This guy is the funniest single human being on the planet.”“Oh, come on,” scoffs Brooks. “Maybe the third.”“Just look at the raft of movies he’s made, from Blazing Saddles onward!” continues Reiner.“Well, The Jerk ain’t so bad,” says Brooks, with a fond pat of his friend’s wrist.The two “got a kick out of one another right away”, Brooks says. “Also, our wives liked each other, which was lucky because we love one another.”“The best thing Mel ever did was marry a girl named Anne Bancroft,” says Reiner.“Yeah, I did,” says Brooks, with a happy smile but sad eyes.“From the first time he saw her, every place she went, he made sure he was there,” chuckles Reiner.“Yeah, I did,” Brooks repeats a little more quietly.Brooks’ first marriage had just ended when he happened to stop by a studio to watch the taping of a Perry Como TV special. It was 5 February 1961. Bancroft was rehearsing and it was love at first sight for Brooks. Unable to control himself, he shouted out, “Anne Bancroft, I love you!”“Who are you?” she replied, peering out into the dark.“I’m Mel Brooks!” he shouted back.“I got your record!” she replied.So it was the 2000 Year Old man that got him a date with Anne Bancroft? “Yeah, pretty much. We started hanging out every day and every night – we couldn’t be without each other. We were made for each other,” Brooks says.Bancroft died from cancer in 2005. It has been hard for Brooks, learning to live without her. There was a period, after a hernia operation, when he stopped going out. “I was stuck at home – emotionally, I mean. I was afraid to go out. But then I pushed forward because that’s what you have to do, and I went out,” he says. Naturally, one of the first places he went was Reiner’s house: “Eating with this guy? You can’t beat it.”Reiner’s home is smart but in no way showy, the way some Beverly Hills homes are. Instead of gilt and marble, the main decorating accents are family photos: every surface is covered with pictures of the Reiners, and the most prominently featured is Reiner’s late wife, Estelle.“That painting there? She did that. My wife was a very fine artist,” says Reiner, pointing to a strikingly beautiful painting on the wall.“And she was a terrific jazz singer. She taught Anne how to play the ukulele,” says Brooks.“Then Anne put her in her movie Fatso. It started a career for her,” says Reiner. She later made appearances in The Man With Two Brains (directed by her husband) and To Be Or Not to Be (directed by Brooks.) But Estelle Reiner’s film career peaked in 1989, thanks not to her friends or husband, but to her son. Rob Reiner cast her in When Harry Met Sally to say the immortal line, “I’ll have what she’s having.”“Yes, she was special,” agrees Reiner. Estelle died in 2008. The two had been married for 64 years.Despite eating in most nights, Brooks and Reiner maintain a social life busier than most people a third of their age: my date with them had to be changed once when they realised they had double booked me with Nathan Lane, and tonight I am being squeezed in just after a visit from Alan Alda. But when you’re in your 90s, your friendship group depletes suddenly. Just weeks before our meeting, the screenwriter Buck Henry died at the age of 89. As well as creating with Brooks the 1960s satirical detective TV show, Get Smart, he wrote The Graduate, which, of course, starred Bancroft.This sets Brooks to thinking about other friends who have passed away: Gene Wilder, of course, Zero Mostel long ago. But also the lesser-known Ronny Graham, who died almost 20 years ago and appeared in many of Brooks’ films.“We wanted to write a musical about Napoleon, but we only ever wrote one song,” says Brooks.“It’s a great song. Give her the lyrics!” says Reiner, but Brooks needs no prompting to perform.“Retreat, retreat! Drop your sword and run  The foe is near, we’re outta here – run!  Run away!  You run away, you live to fight another day! Retreat!” he sings, hitting some properly impressive high notes.“But I think there’s no question the people we miss most are our wives,” says Brooks, solemn again.In one of the running jokes in 2000 Year Old Man, Brooks explains his longevity, for which he credits, variously, avoiding fried foods and airplanes. Brooks and Reiner haven’t made it to 2000, but combined their ages almost add up to 200, so what is their secret?“Eating the food here,” Brooks replies immediately.“Being blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren. Have you ever met his son, Max?” asks Reiner, referring to Brooks and Bancroft’s only child, now an acclaimed writer.I say I have not.“You must! The word genius is thrown around, but this boy is a true genius. And he learned how to do so much himself!” says Reiner, marvelling at 47-year-old Max Brooks’ precocity.I tell Reiner I interviewed his son, Rob, two years ago.“Who?” he asks, having drifted off a little.“Rob Reiner, your son,” Brooks mock shouts into Reiner’s ear.But really, Reiner thinks the secret to a long life is “having something to do in the morning”, and these two men are proof of this maxim. Brooks has been busy recently with the screening of an HBO special about his life.“Do you have the DVDs?” he asks, and I assume he is referring to the special. But it turns out he means a box set he has just put out of Bancroft’s movies, determined her legacy is not forgotten. “I’ll make sure you get them,” he promises.Reiner, meanwhile, has just published his 19th and 20th books. Known as his “scrunch” books, they feature pictures of, in one, celebrities and, in the other, famous works of art, but scrunched up, and you have to guess who or what they are. Reiner himself is in it, and his name is given as “Estelle’s husband, Carl.” I thought the books were a bit mad when I saw them, but back at my hotel, I can’t stop playing Reiner’s scrunch game. Never doubt the entertainment nous of a man with nine Emmys (for Caesar’s Hour, The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mad About You) and a Grammy (for The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000) for comedy.Reiner and Brooks’ evening routine never changes: they sit and talk “about everything”, then have dinner in front of Reiner’s massive TV while they watch Jeopardy!. It seems like a pretty great life, and it is.“I don’t think I’ve ever had a better friend than Carl,” says Brooks.“My God, the thought of being without him – the world would be too bleak!” says Reiner, and Brooks’ face falls a little, as if he is envisaging all too clearly a world without Reiner.“Now, come on, Carl, let her ask some questions,” he says.I tell them I just like listening to them talk to one another.“But you might want to ask about something specific, and Carl will be ready, willing and able to answer anything,” says Brooks, buoying them both along.Reiner puts his hand on top of Brooks’. “Always,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right near a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. Mummy was happy cause my little sister got in for free! They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon, but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It’s a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs.

Plus: how Al Pacino lost the bloom of youthNews that Prince Harry and Meghan will cease their royal duties at the end of next month is now in, yet offers no letup in the backbreaking schedule of Windsors-related toss-giving demanded of all UK humans.On the one hand, we are told that all this may turn out to be a mortal blow for the royal family, though my feeling is the mere fact of “Charles III” has the potential to be rather more seismic. On the other hand, we have never seemed to care more about these people. Whatever happened to Prince Charles’s much vaunted plan for a slimmed-down royal family?Over the past fortnight, there has been extensive coverage of the orce of Peter Phillips, an event that perhaps mildly explains the trashy milk adverts Princess Anne’s son filmed for the Chinese market. One of these showed him as a shill for a state-owned dairy in the grounds of a palace-like stately home, gulping down milk as if his dignity depended on it, adorned by the slogan “British Royal Family Member Peter Phillips”. This generated a content frenzy, including such hilarities as the headline “PRINCESS DIANA’S CHEF SPOTS MAJOR ERROR IN PETER PHILLIPS’ MILK ADVERT.”Then, barely a week after the Phillips orce news, we were “rocked” on behalf of the Queen by news of “yet more family heartache”, with the orce of her nephew Viscount Linley and his wife Serena, a pair with the sort of general name recognition you might enjoy in one of the better witness protection programmes.At first glance, it might seem that these hugely arcane tours through the court and social outliers are just an easy way to get more Meghan into the SEO terms. But the sheer churn of it all suggests that interest in the royals is the highest it’s been in years. Whether or not people care to admit it, they are most drawn to the Windsors when they are having unhappy dramas. The relationship of royal watchers to the watched is hugely dysfunctional.Take Prince Andrew’s 60th birthday, which was yesterday. A year ago, this event would have got no coverage to speak of, though the party he’d have thrown to celebrate might have provided some bog standard Range Rover arrival shots of people you didn’t care about even in the 90s. But given The Unpleasantness, there have been acres of stuff written about the very absence of celebration, all sufficiently lapped up for further acres of it to be produced to meet demand. There was the week of drama over whether or not councils should have to fly their town hall flags to mark it the alleged “furore” over Westminster Abbey’s bells ringing for it further slavering over how very little there was to slaver over. A personal favourite was Buckingham Palace’s unnecessary decision to press release the duke’s own decision NOT to become a full admiral, which you sense would have been a wrench for Andy. It’s a much better 60th birthday present than whisky stones, an apron saying “Old Fart”, or a brain-training game.Over to the formal Buckingham Palace communiqué on the matter, which milked the upset for all it was worth: “By convention, the Duke of York would be in line for military promotion on his 60th birthday,” it began ominously. “Following the decision by His Royal Highness to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the Duke of York has asked the Ministry of Defence if this promotion might be deferred until such time that His Royal Highness returns to public duty.”Could be the 12th of never could be in his 90s, just in time to take advantage of the rising sea levels. Either way, you get the strong impression that the Windsors are still serving up exactly what people want. I’m struggling to imagine how they could have leaned in to it all any further, bar throwing Andrew’s 60th dinner at Pizza Express in Woking.Instead, Andrew’s bijou 60th gathering was held at Royal Lodge, home of the duke and his destranged wife, Duchess Fergie. According to reports, the number of invitees who found they were unavailable on the date grew so large that a second batch of invitations was sent out by Fergie’s assistant.The standout report into the matter was one in the Mail offering what its two authors called “a haunting insight” into the upcoming dinner. This opened with a throwback to the Queen’s 60th bash. “Click, click,” wrote the reporters of that event, really putting you inside the action. “Taking the pictures was her son, Andrew … He was 26. Friends recall him marvelling at his mother and wondering ‘what I’ll be like at 60’.” Well how very convenient for your article that they do. Or as the authors put it grimly: “Now we know.”Then again, the many “friends” of the Duke have been on hand since the Epstein story broke, and for the past few weeks have been chiefly concerned with furnishing non-details of the non-event of his holing up at home. “We call it being in the bunker”, confided one of these friends to the Mail this week, as though that were a terrifically abstruse term of art.So, yes, do expect much more news on all these developing stories in the months and years to come. For now, it is to be assumed that you are across the fact that Prince Andrew is hunkered down at home – what they call “being in the bunker” – with the weather “so wet that he has hardly been able to expel his frustrations on the golf course”. Perhaps that’s for the best. Were HRH to play a round, I can only picture him tailed by a helpful friend, who would mark any unfortunate foray into a sanded course hazard by solemnly informing other golfers: “We call it being in the bunker.”Now to news – perhaps not entirely unexpected – of the romantic status of movie legend Al Pacino. When the 79-year-old star took a tumble on the Baftas red carpet a few weeks ago, I did think his girlfriend, 40, looked slightly more disdainfully appalled than solicitous. But maybe the camera angles were deceptive.And yet, were they? It seems Meital Dohan broke up her two-year relationship with Pacino in the days immediately thereafter, leading to the actor’s solo appearance on the red carpet at the Oscars a week later. And that, ordinarily, would be that – except that madam has now granted a screamingly gracious interview to a magazine in her native Israel to mark the occasion.“It’s hard to be with a man so old, even Al Pacino,” Meital informs the publication. “The age gap is difficult, yes. I tried to deny it, but now he is already an elderly man, to be honest. So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”Even with all her love, there was only so much that could be done for the poor dotard and so on. As for what she got, materially, out of the two years they spent together, Meital also tends toward the candid. “He only bought me flowers. How can I say politely that he didn’t like to spend money?”I … don’t know how you can. Some other way than this way, arguably?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3088f24f8ba76329a396c4ab11749c17db5cd4/0_169_5224_3135/master/5224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae2559aa5fd3d957fe961a20005c2e7","title":"lawyers to seek asylum for julian assange in france","story":"Assange’s European defence team say it is their duty to raise case with Emmanuel MacronJulian Assange’s European defence team have said they will try to seek asylum for him in France. Hearings over Assange’s extradition from the UK to the US on spying charges are due to start next week in London.Éric Dupond-Moretti said the “fate and the status of all journalists” was at stake in Assange’s case. “We consider the situation is sufficiently serious,” he said, “that our duty is to talk about it” with the French president, Emmanuel Macron.He was one of a team of lawyers lined up at a Paris news conference to explain why they view the case against Assange as unfair, citing his poor health and alleged violations of his rights while in jail in London.French members of the team said they had been working on a “concrete demand” for Macron to grant Assange asylum in France, where he has children and where WikiLeaks had a presence at its founding.Baltasar Garzón, the Spanish coordinator of Assange’s team, reiterated his client’s plan to claim that the Trump administration offered him a pardon in return for saying Russia was not involved in leaking Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 US election campaign.Garzón said Assange was “pressured by the Trump administration” but resisted, and “the order was given to demand the extradition of Julian Assange”.The White House has firmly denied the claim. However, Garzón said that testimony and “documentary proof” of the claim would be offered to the court at the full hearing which opens on Monday.Assange, 48, spent seven years in Ecuador’s London embassy before being evicted and arrested in April 2019. Last November, Sweden dropped a sex crimes investigation against him because so much time had elapsed.Assange, who is Australian, has received backing from numerous quarters. The Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatović, added a voice of opposition on Thursday, citing concerns over Assange’s eventual treatment in a US prison and the impact on press freedoms were he to be extradited.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, visited Assange in prison on Thursday and said: “I think this is one of the most important and significant political trials of this generation – in fact longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfea5b95193d01da63f26323fce23a0207321cb7/0_1012_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b76b09b2fbab8a3f15d8520c0b55fa","title":"grimes miss anthropocene review 4ad","story":"(4AD)Notionally a concept album about the goddess of climate crisis, the Canadian’s fifth album is actually a compellingly chaotic statement about her own private lifeMiss Anthropocene has had a lengthy, difficult birth. As perhaps befits an album that was announced in 2017, then derailed by ferocious-sounding spats between artist and record company, rerecording, and rejigging of the track listing, it comes with a weighty concept attached. Miss Anthropocene is, Grimes says, a work based around the idea of anthropomorphising climate change into the figure of a villainous goddess (“she’s naked all the time and she’s made out of ivory and oil”) whose name is a conflation of “misanthrope” and the proposed scientific term for the current geological epoch, and who celebrates the imminent destruction of the world.This seems like a more original approach to the topic of global heating than the standard songwriter practice of finger-wagging. But the actual album, now that it’s here, gives the distinct impression of being a conceptual work in the same way that Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is a conceptual work: ie, that its maker came up with a big, overarching idea that they then more or less abandoned after a couple of songs.There are points on Miss Anthropocene when the whole naked-evil-climate-crisis-goddess-made-from-ivory-and-oil thing is in evidence. “This is the sound of the end of the world,” Grimes sings over a haze of noisy, shoegazey guitar on Before the Fever. “I got everything you want, I can make it feel so wet”. My Name Is Dark, meanwhile, is punctuated by screams, and Grimes snarls “imminent annihilation sounds so dope” in a 21st-century equivalent of the horrified relish with which some post-punk artists conjured scenarios of nuclear apocalypse.But for the most part, Miss Anthropocene seems inspired less by climate change than by recent events in the musician’s life. Already the kind of artist whose vast media footprint dwarfs the sales of her critically acclaimed albums – her biggest seller, 2012’s Visions, reached No 98 in the US – Grimes’s profile soared even further when she appeared in public on the arm of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In America, a country that may be even more given to pearl-clutching about what you might call indie ethics than the UK, news of their romance was greeted as if the lead singer of Idles had announced his engagement to Katie Hopkins.Perhaps understandably, Grimes took being held up as the living embodiment of contemporary nihilism owing to her romantic choices quite badly. “Love is the thing that’s fucking up my career,” she protested to one interviewer. “My reputation is at an all-time low,” she told another. It’s the response to her private life that seems to be at the root of Miss Anthropocene, which opens with a song in which Grimes imagines being dragged to some kind of netherworld on account of who she’s sleeping with. Industrial noise rages over pummelling bass, a leaden drum pattern thuds, her breathy vocals keep threatening to sound euphoric – beginning to spiral upwards as the song reaches its chorus before pulling back to somewhere darker and more discomfiting. If it’s a concept album at all, it’s about the toxicity of modern celebrity, not CO2 emissions.And on those terms, Miss Anthropocene works remarkably well: for all the sci-fi theorising, the emotions at its centre feel prosaic, realistic and affecting. By turns it is disorienting (the frantic Chinese vocals on Darkseid create the same mood of panicky confusion as Michi Hirota’s contributions to David Bowie’s It’s No Game) and defiant (“You want to make me bad and I like it like that,” she insists on Violence). But the defiance, the whole how-do-you-like-me-now? idea, isn’t terribly convincing, and is undercut by the overwhelming mood of melancholy in varying shades, from Delete Forever’s resigned acoustic strum to You’ll Miss Me When I’m Not Around, which sets some bleak lyrics about self-harm and suicide to a weird blend of grunge guitar rock and wilfully plasticky vocal samples.Not all the musical experiments work. The Bollywood samples, bursts of lock-stepped drum’n’bass and one-note chorus of 4AM are more annoying than intriguing. But most do. Idoru, a title that borrows a Japanese word for a pampered star, is ostensibly a profession of love but there is something chaotic and shaky about its sound, decorated with lo-fi recordings of birdsong and melodica it often feels like the only thing preventing it from collapsing entirely is the rhythm track.On New Gods, meanwhile, the pretty vocal melody is drowned out by its own vast echo – one of a handful of points on the album where it feels as if Grimes is retreating. Her vocals are so regularly smeared or buried you feel as if you’re straining to eavesdrop. That makes sense: Miss Anthropocene seems a more personal project than its advance billing suggested. It doesn’t add much to the climate change debate, but as a representation of what it’s like when fame turns dark, it is powerful and compelling.Daniel Avery and Alessandro Cortini: Illusion of TimeThe first track from a collaborative album due next month, Illusion of Time is beautiful: a lulling melody doing battle with a slowly rising tide of electronic noise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3aa6c9fe4cb005b216d70d206c2d89ae713376/0_197_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51caca46657187d36123e2bce657615c","title":"it feels like an extra limb musicians on the bond with their instruments","story":"Horrible things happen to instruments in transit – as Ballaké Sissoko and others have recently learned. Five musicians explain why the damage goes more than skin deepOne thing successful musicians have to do a lot of is travel, and when you travel with an instrument, you increase its chances of getting damaged. Early this month, the Malian musician Ballaké Sissoko’s kora was taken apart by US border agents when he left New York, something Sissoko only discovered when he picked it up in Paris. A few days later, Louis Levitt discovered a four-inch crack in his $100,000 double bass after it had been unpacked for security screening at Newark airport, and a few days after that, specialist instrument movers dropped Angela Hewitt’s £150,000 F278 Fazioli piano while removing it from a studio after a recording session, rendering it “unsalvageable”.The loss of an instrument, though, is about more than inconvenience or financial cost. It’s about the loss of something that can feel like an integral part of a musician’s being – it’s their means of self-expression. And after years of playing one instrument, simply swapping to another isn’t as easy as it sounds – musicians and their instruments have relationships and losing one can be as hard as losing a lover. Here, five musicians talk about the instruments they play, and what those instruments mean to them.A special instrument feels like an extra limb. Once you find that one instrument, a replacement is really hard to come by, and you have to introduce yourself to a whole new limb and get used to it all over again.This SG is one I was instantly comfortable with, and it just stuck. If I break a string halfway through the set and they pass me a different guitar, it just plays different. It’s hard to describe if you’re not a guitar player – it fits perfectly in your hand, and your hands know what you’re doing, because you’ve worked with the instrument for so long. That way, you are comfortable expressing yourself, and of course the easier an instrument it is to play, the easier it is to express yourself.My number one thing for my guitar techs is: do not clean the pickups. I like the sound of pickups that are worn down and kind of degraded – it’s just more interesting sounding. That is why my SG is so unique, because of how the pickups were wound, and how long it has been since they were cleaned up. I think this one is from the early 80s. It has cigarette burns on it, because other people had it before me. It had some cracked paint in the back. The white of the trim has faded into the yellow colour, and all those things hold the history of the instrument. And truthfully, I’ve never checked it in with an airline, because I don’t trust them. It comes with me on the flight, or it’s shipped to meet me in a protective case. That’s my right. Everyone else gets to bring their laptops and their work I can bring my guitar.I went into Sevenoaks Guitars, a secondhand shop, one day in 1991 or 1992, and they had this big old analogue synth blunderbluss for £200. It was my first proper analogue poly synth, and the thing I learned on it was so integral to the music of the first three or four albums that I can’t do without it. I’ve tried to replace it, but nothing else will do. About a year ago it started playing up and I got another one that cost something like £4,200, but it’s not the same. So I’m going back to my old one, which has been serviced and repaired. Old synthesisers are like old cars – they work best if you use them all the time, so even if I’m not using them, I’ll tweak a few knobs to keep them happy.Every instrument feels different. Even drum machines – everyone’s Roland 909 feels different. I’ll be saying, “Oh, this one’s got tribal tom-toms,” and everyone else will be saying, “What are you talking about? They all sound exactly the same.” I think the differences between synths are more pronounced on the big, old analogue models, though. That’s partly because of the devil-may-care way they were made by hand, and partly age. As they grow older, the lines grow deeper and they erge from each other, depending on what they’ve been through: a well-toured Jupiter sounds different from one that has sat in a studio. Classical musicians say instruments mellow with age, and it’s the same with synthesisers. When people say, “Why can’t new synths sound the same as vintage ones?” the answer is because they haven’t aged.I know my Jupiter 6 inside out. I am fluent in it. I can have an idea and I know what it will do with that idea. I know how many millimetres to move my fingers on its controls without even needing to look. I find myself playing with eyes closed, like a prog rock guitarist.I don’t travel with this bass. I’ve had basses rolled over by luggage trucks all sorts of horrible things have happened, so I learned my lesson quickly.I got it when a young bass player developed tendinitis and took it as a cue he wasn’t destined to be a bass player. I got it at a ridiculous price. And over the years I have put a lot of love and care and tending to it, and now everyone who touches it is in awe at its beauty and tone.Familiarity builds a unique relationship with an instrument, because you’re investing your time and your care. There’s something about getting acclimated to all of the quirks and resonances, but it also gets acclimated to your touch and hand. It’s a deep familiarity. There is less translation time between what your ear wants to create and what your body can facilitate. For me, and anyone in the improvisational world, that’s so important. You want to know you can immediately respond to what you perceive.Sometimes the relationship with an instrument is never really consummated, and that’s a cue, too. With the bass I have now, for many years I struggled with it. It was very difficult to play, but I loved the sound. Now, after 15 years, it feels like home. It will keep accumulating with me, and that relationship will deepen. It’s a constant.There is also something about the intention the instrument was made with. In a way, the luthiers are mystics, too, because they are creating these vessels for ine vibrations to enter the world through. When you are using an instrument that’s been made for a particular player, through a particular cultural lineage, the instrument itself is charged with so much spirit that it has to be treated with reverence. They are like sacred objects. That’s why it was so painful to hear about Ballaké Sissoko’s kora.I have a tracking device in my flight case. If something happens to my tuba, I can’t work. There have been times when it hasn’t shown up on the conveyor belt at the airport and the baggage staff have said, “It’s not here.” And I have known for a fact that it is and can tell them to look again. I try not to stress about my instruments too much, but the tracking device has put things a bit more in my power.Tubas come in different keys. I like E-flats because they are quite versatile they have the weight and the lower power in them, but I’m also able to create in a soloistic way. There are instruments I have played that I couldn’t channel on a vibrational level. Musicians want to feel like when we speak, our musical intention is coming out as clear as possible, and not playing the right instrument can prevent you from expressing yourself as quickly and as accurately as you would like. The instruments I have resonate in a way that make me feel comfortable.The average person who doesn’t play an instrument might not hear the differences, but someone who lives with it will know the smallest difference in the tone. It might be minuscule, but to someone who plays, it can make the difference to whether they enjoy playing a gig or not.I have a theory that when string instruments have been played really well for 200 years, which is probably the case with my cello, the player changes the instrument on an atomic level, so the wood starts vibrating in a different way. When I play one that hasn’t been played at all, or played badly, it’s like a horse that has been ridden badly for a long time and has lots of bad habits. And while I think my own musical voice is within myself, it’s impossible at this stage to know what is my voice and what is the voice that came from my Guadagnini. It has coloured my whole life.I met this cello in Vienna. I fell in love with it on second or third sight. It’s like the best people: they take a little bit of time to start unravelling some of their layers. The first time I thought, “I dearly hope this is my cello for life” was when I played a concert with it. I had the feeling that whatever I had in my mind, in my soul, it would come out in the sound.The cello travels next to me all the time. I have two seats on airlines. The one time it didn’t travel next to me it sat in the cockpit on a flight in South America. No one gets to touch my cello when I’m travelling. I’ve never thought of it in monetary terms. It’s more that I feel like I’m travelling with three children – my two actual children and one cello. The difference is that the cello doesn’t run off.• Do you have a strong bond with a musical instrument?

Now, it is in the charts. More than ever, artists from the styles of Afrobeats, Afroswing and Afropop are weaving traditional mysticism into their work in a way that smirks at the scary stories and stern warnings from their parents that they will have absorbed as children of the African diaspora.The essential point of juju is that the outside world is not as it initially appears to the naked eye. When Gambian-British rap star J Hus refers to himself as Juju Jay, alongside his personification as bonsam (the direct Ghanaian Twi translation for which is “devil”), he is doing a lot more than saying he is the bad guy you don’t want turning up at your door at night. Afroswing group NSG’s track Options, a recent No 7 hit in the UK charts, features rapper Dopebwoy jokingly speculating on the fate of his enemies, saying “fuck around and I’ll take your pic to the shrine”, implying that disrespect warrants a cosmic retaliation. Wizkid’s video for viral hit Jaiye Jaiye similarly sees him mesh the language of material wealth, “Maserati fun iyawo mi, Ferragamo, Bugatti” with the aesthetic of tribal worship: white facepaint, masks and rural landscapes.Historically, music with African roots has always been charged with spirituality. In 1971, Fela Kuti opened his first live venue in Lagos, Nigeria – named the Shrine. The height of his spiritual journey saw him revoke Christianity entirely, adopting the Yoruba name Anikulapo, meaning “he who carries death in his pouch”. Nearly three decades later, Erykah Badu’s album Baduizm continued the tradition. Her persona was that of a healing matriarch, while the lyrics were permeated with the language of the Five Percent Nation, operating on the principle that all black people are ine. More recently, in her visuals for her 2016 album Lemonade, Beyoncé saluted the 401 Orisha – of the Yoruba people – her yellow dress in Hold Up a nod to the goddess Oshun’s golden adornments. By taking African mysticism to the world stage, Beyoncé stripped it of its ancient pagan labels.Among those of African heritage, the connection between black music and black magic has never gone away. As a child, I remember the hysterical rumours circulating London’s secondary schools that the Brixton rapper Sneakbo could turn into a cat to get out of tricky situations. Some rappers on local council estates wore protection rings to call on mystical forces to shield them against the prying eyes of their enemies and the police. Engaging with practices often condemned as demonic by churches gives Afropop the frisson of a shared secret. Artists acknowledge the seriousness of their references, but spice it with the humour and glamour of modern pop.Monique Charles, a cultural sociologist, takes this further, pointing to the brutality of enslavement and colonialism that stripped native musical and religious practices from African cultures. This, along with the pressures of a capitalist music business, however, “do not mean that the approaches to music-making and spiritual practice have ceased”, Charles says, but rather have “shifted in order to survive”. As a result, traces of spirituality will always “leak through” – hence the subtle nods from J Hus, NSG and others. In this light, any predominantly black music form represents a connection to our ancestors.Now, a generation is choosing to lean into mysticism, even if their parents, who embraced western religion, are dubious about it. Musicians’ embrace of African spirituality helps to produce the experimental, hybrid sound of African pop that the media and music industry often struggles to pin down– but that those in the know innately recognise. Indigenous culture will always inform and dictate the language of the African diaspora’s music – and spirituality is giving it that extra bit of magic.

The remaining hopefuls had to first secure sufficient support from Labour MPs or MEPs, and then from local parties of affiliated groups.The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters opens a week later on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.Speaking earlier on Thursday, Nandy said she would be happy to serve in the shadow cabinets of either Starmer or Long-Bailey if they won.“Yeah, of course,” the Wigan MP told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “What you don’t actually realise is we are quite good mates behind the scenes, there’s a camaraderie that comes from being put through this process.“We’re the only people who understand how tough it is and, yes, I’d be proud to serve in their shadow cabinets.”Asked the same question last week, Starmer said he “saluted” Nandy and Long-Bailey, but did not say whether he would be willing to serve under either of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82df378803fe493f7eb757a1bba636e14d665bd6/76_0_7344_4407/master/7344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5cf95675fe91e805c00a140700752d0","title":"share your views on gene editing","story":"We would like to find out what you think about gene editing.

I’m not really dressed for it, I’m basically walking through the dead of winter in a pair of shreddies.”Along the way he has been treated like a hero, he received a £50,000 cheque on the road near Old Trafford in Manchester, was praised on BBC Breakfast and was treated to a hero’s welcome in his home city, where he will celebrate with a fundraising ball in March.A few days ago a 75-year-old woman made her daughter drive 50 miles to give him a cuddle, and as he speaks to the  a woman from the village he has just passed through arrives with a cup of hot tea, while a driver passes by tooting the car horn. “It’s heartwarming to think anyone can dedicate time to great causes,” said Jules Hayden from Whitemoor in Cornwall. “I just wanted to give him something to keep him warm.”After his cup of tea, Cullen said: “It brings a little bit of light into people’s lives, doesn’t it? It makes people smile and that makes it all worth it. It’s more than just raising money, it’s spreading a lot of love.”Cullen – who has become a well known figure in Liverpool thanks to frequent social media posts of him chatting and dancing along the route – started his trek from John o’Groats to Land’s End on 10 December and is now just over £15,000 pounds off hitting his donation target of £250,000.The club he follows has shown him a lot of love in return. When Cullen got a calf injury he was taken to Everton’s training ground, Finch Farm, to meet the players and receive treatment. “His presence on a matchday is really unique in the Premier League and he is as popular with away fans as he is with home supporters,” said the former Everton player Ian Snodin. “Mick epitomises the positive and caring attitude that Evertonians and scousers have.”It was the Channel swim that led him to develop his trademark look, he explained. “I thought there’s no way I’m putting a pair of Speedos on, it took me a year to not feel embarrassed in the swimming pool but I got over myself – and I’m glad I did, because I swam the Channel and by then I was used to them.”So used to them, in fact, that he started visiting Goodison Park to watch Everton dressed only in his trunks and has since been welcomed in stadiums across the country. “The Speedos bring people together and it did that with fans from other clubs as well,” he said. “People respected what I was doing, and instead of being horrible banter it was nice and funny.”He said he struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and mental health issues for many years, and was homeless for a time. He has been clean and sober for 18 years, but could only do that thanks to the help of others – so he wanted to spread his message of hope and endurance via the unconventional means of a bright blue pair of pants.“My message to people is that there is always hope,” he said. “Hope lives in the darkest places, even when you don’t think it is there. All my thinking got me to a dark and lonely place, so my message to anyone else there who is suffering, and a lot of people are, is that there is hope and you can turn your life around. You can get your life back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f5f2892f43b1c5c9f5d522486d91d50728e21ad/0_356_5343_3206/master/5343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379a3903c40b069f2b5a301acbff77c1","title":"opportunities abound for womens cricket as t20 world cup arrives","story":"The women’s side of the ledger can get a huge boost with the tournament in one of the game’s most important economiesStrategically, Cricket Australia has been building up to this home season for five years. The impressive growth of women’s cricket in Australia over that time has not been the result of hitting and hoping. It was calculated, and so far the sums have proved accurate. But in substantial part it has been achieved domestically, not by the input the national women’s team.Such teams have their moments of ignition. England enjoyed theirs in 2017, when their winning 50-over World Cup campaign saw pool matches packing out smaller grounds, then the triumph of 27,000 people selling out the final at Lord’s. India in the same tournament went from barely noticed to national sensations in their own country, a surge that peaked when current captain Harmanpreet Kaur downed Australia in the semi-final with her outrageous unbeaten 171.Australia’s national women’s players are highly regarded at home, with a long winning history and none of the controversy of their male counterparts. But there is still the chance of one big boost taking their game much further into mainstream national thought. The summer of 2020 will see the first ICC tournament branded as a Twenty20 World Cup, giving the shortest format a similar cachet to the one-day international game. It’s also the first major women’s tournament to be held in Australia since the game’s revolution began.The big leap was in 2015, when the Big Bash League was duplicated to create a women’s version. A lot of things were ropey: coverage was sporadic, the schedule could best be described as experimental, and the spread of talent across an unprecedented eight teams created a sharp dip in quality about halfway through each XI. But where the AFL women’s competition has had to push against instances of administrative ambivalence and public hostility, the cricket equivalent got far more consistent support.Investing heavily without being distracted by teething problems was CA’s approach, and it worked. Within the first season, the television numbers were way over predictions and more games were put on air. By the third, players had new professional contracts and the on-field standard skyrocketed. By the fourth, grounds were selling out for the final, and half the national squad was made up of new players who had emerged through the WBBL.This enthusiasm and support relied little on the marketing clout of the green and gold. In fact opportunities were scarce for the national team to be seen when the stakes were high. In home seasons, their television presence was limited to some scattered bilateral matches sprinkled into gaps in the men’s program. There was one Ashes series in 2017, when CA’s website had to stream Ellyse Perry’s double-century because no station would screen a women’s Test. The major ICC tournaments were in India in 2013, Bangladesh in 2014, India in 2016, England in 2017, and the West Indies in 2018. Consigned to strange hours and obscure channels, not many people engaged with the results. Prestige will only take you so far when the tournament itself appears in the mind as a half-remembered dream, glimpsed on a phone update on a 4am bathroom sojourn.This is where the T20 World Cup comes in, with various stars aligning in a most promising way. Simplified and rebranded, easily digestible, packaged into a trim two-and-a-half weeks with action almost every day. Some feelgood stories of battling teams, some grudge matches with old rivals, some foreign stars in most sides who have impressed locally during WBBL visits.Most importantly this World Cup falls into a helpful gap in the program, after a men’s cricket summer that could comfortably be described as failing to whelm. Those who were left with a hunger for something meaningful in their favourite bat-and-ball sport could find it here. The AFLW competition has started up already, but the two women’s codes could be seen as acting in solidarity rather than rivalry. The meaningless pre-season faff of the AFL men’s competition has not yet reached the full roar of its white noise. It’s still summer, just. Time for cricket.So this is the opportunity: to give the women’s side of the ledger a huge boost in one of the game’s most important economies. To lay an easily locatable marker that signals the future viability and vitality of the sport. To draw the men’s and women’s national teams closer in how they are regarded and covered.At the same time, it will underline a disparity that only increases. England and India have had their turbocharges, Australia may have its own. But these are the three teams that are strongest, the three nations offering most support, the three boards with Smaug’s share of cricket’s global gold. They can afford good women’s programs, where players can genuinely reach their best.Coming up against them will be teams poorly placed to compete. New Zealand and South Africa have some fine players but operate on the bus-fare budgets of the others. West Indies were among the best but dropped into a sinkhole. Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh perennially struggle, as much against antipathy from home to their existence as against their opponents.They can win once in a while, as Sri Lanka showed by thrashing England in a warm-up this week, but only when a standout player like Chamari Atapattu has a star turn. Day to day, week to week, they can’t keep up. If the plan leading up to this tournament does work, and women’s cricket in Australia gets its boost, a good part of the rewards need to be erted elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d354bc575b2ba5e11c73c980ba507e1186d96b4/0_304_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a0572b59f7529ddd003d34098b5b313","title":"rory mcilroy does his talking on course to lead in mexico","story":"The day after making an emphatic statement off the course, Rory McIlroy did precisely the same when back on it. Evidence of an excellent start to the season is provided by a McIlroy scoring average of 68.5 from nine rounds, two of which were 73s.McIlroy, recently returned as the world No 1, marched to the top of the leaderboard at the WGC Mexico Championship here with a 65. Whereas on Wednesday, McIlroy created shockwaves by vehemently dismissing plans for a breakaway tour, Thursday he successfully returned to his natural domain.McIlroy made a birdie at the 9th, his 18th, from 9ft to take a two-stroke lead over Bubba Watson and Justin Thomas. The highlight of a six-under-par round had come much earlier: at the 11th, his 2nd, he played a glorious four-iron from 274 yards to within 15ft. A converted eagle putt followed.It remains early in the year – and the event – but the indications are McIlroy is back to his best.“I’m confident because I am playing well,” he said. “Regardless whether I have a 1 or a 2 or a 10 beside my name in the world rankings, I’m comfortable with my game, I’m comfortable with what I’m doing and that’s the most important thing.”McIlroy switched putter, back to the one he used in 2019, following last week’s Genesis Invitational. So far, so good on that front.McIlroy said he had received “nice messages” over his Premier League stance. “I wasn’t hoping for anything,” he said. “I was just providing my point of view and getting it off my chest. I wasn’t trying to do anything or prove a point or try to get any sort of praise.“I’ve been sick of talking about it for the last few months and I’m happy that everyone knows where I stand.”Paul Casey matched Hatton’s score, as did Lee Westwood.

Hamilton took to the track for the second day of testing in Barcelona using an innovative steering system but one whose legality may still be called into question.Having already been the fastest driver on day one, Hamilton completed 106 laps of relentless running in the morning session. While doing so he was observed to be using the new system, understood to be dual-axis steering and referred to by the team as DAS.Hamilton would not go into detail but pronounced himself pleased with the team’s inventive approach. “We’re trying to get on top of it, understand it,” he said. “Safety wise, no problem and the FIA are OK with the project. It’s really encouraging to see my team continuing to innovate and stay ahead of the game.“I think that’s down to the great minds in the team and hopefully it will work to our benefit.”The system appeared to adjust the alignment of the front wheels when Hamilton moved the steering wheel towards himself on the straights and back again on corner entry. It would theoretically offer reduced drag on the straights and a better set-up for cornering.Mercedes had taken the paddock by surprise and rival teams pored over footage of Hamilton’s cockpit. The Mercedes technical director, James Allison, confirmed DAS had already been approved by the FIA.That approval will not rule out rival teams challenging the system but initial engineering assessments suggest it is within the regulations.Hamilton also confirmed he has yet to begin negotiations on a new contract, with his deal at Mercedes coming to a close at the end of this season. The British driver is 35 and in his 14th season in F1. Any move will almost certainly be his last and Hamilton has been linked with a move to Ferrari but he once more emphasised that his relationship with Mercedes is as strong as ever.“When I joined Mercedes they allowed me to be who I am and where I want to be rather than keep me constricted or ask me to be a certain way, speak a certain way or dress a certain way, which is often what you see at other places,” he said.“I think it has been great and there are all these question marks over all the different things that I do but everyone has seen the results that I have over these last few years.”Hamilton said Toto Wolff was keen to begin talks and that last time the two thrashed out the contract in eight to 10 hours sitting on a couch. He was optimistic they would be able to do similarly again.“We just don’t seem to have any problems,” he said. “We share the same values and our goals are the same and the respect is huge and the understanding.”Ferrari have already done a deal with Charles Leclerc until the end of 2024. Sebastian Vettel’s contract concludes this season but the team chief, Mattia Binotto, has insisted Ferrari are intent on keeping the German."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9a2ae58e51d2b5b1c218bb97f6e026ec87016c/681_6_1100_660/master/1100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d8b8cf43a592af8e6009bc0b4fcddcf","title":"revealed the areas in the uk with one airbnb for every four homes","story":"‘Out-of-control’ dominance of rentals in some communities depriving locals of homes, critics sayAirbnb has become so prevalent in Great Britain that some parts of the country now have one listing for every four properties, prompting concern that the rapid expansion in short-term lets is “out of control” and depriving communities of much-needed homes.Exclusive analysis by the  identified Airbnb hotspots in both rural areas and inner-city neighbourhoods, where the ratio of active Airbnb listings to homes was more than 20 times higher than the average across England, Scotland and Wales.The highest incidence of Airbnbs was in Edinburgh Old Town, where there were 29 active listings for every 100 properties.In England, the area with the highest rate of Airbnb lets was Woolacombe, Georgeham and Croyde, in Devon, with 23 listings for every 100 properties.In one area of the Lake District: Windermere North, Ambleside and Langdales, there were 19 listings per 100 properties. Local MP Tim Farron described the growth of Airbnb in an area already dominated by second home owners as “a really disturbing issue”.Airbnb questioned the accuracy of the findings, emphasising that unusual listings such as caravans or large manor houses, used for events, may not affect the local housing stock. It said some listings may be booked for only a few nights a year.But others warned that the growth of Airbnb played to wider concerns about the effect of short-term lets. “The unchecked growth of online holiday lettings is depriving communities of much-needed homes,” said Dan Wilson Craw, the director of housing pressure group Generation Rent. “In rural areas and cities alike, the story is the same: young adults can’t afford to settle down in the areas they grew up in.”Six years on, a two-bed terrace in the village now sells for £325,000, way out of the reach of working locals, who earn on average just £345 a week. Such properties are now listed for £130 or more a night on Airbnb – much more during the peak tourism season.Cumbrian county councillor Jonathan Brook said he did not object to people renting out their homes on a short-term basis, when it could be argued they are “actually contributing to the viability of a community, as the guests will use the local services at a time when the owners themselves are not”.However, he added: “If properties are being bought and are being exclusively used for Airbnb lettings, they should be registered as a business. There is some evidence that properties are being purchased for Airbnb lettings in areas and housing estates that have not previously appealed to the rental sector. These are homes that should be used as homes for local families, especially when we currently have over 3,000 families on the housing waiting list.” cross-referenced a database of more than 250,000 Airbnb listings with government housing stock figures to calculate the “penetration rate” of Airbnbs in 8,000 areas across England, Wales and Scotland. Across the whole of Great Britain, there were 0.8 Airbnb listings for every 100 homes.Listings data – covering the six months to January – was provided by Inside Airbnb, a non-commercial project that aims to highlight the impact of the service on residential housing markets.The analysis included active listings only. A listing was considered active if the host had updated its availability calendar in the last six months.Airbnb says the findings are based on “unreliable scraped data and flawed methodology”.“Airbnb has long led the way on home-sharing rules and we are currently working with government and stakeholders across the UK on proposals for a host registration system to ensure that rules work for them too,” a spokesman said.In the most touristic areas, hotels and conventional B\u0026ampBs also now advertise on the site, as well as campsites offering mobile homes, camping pods or wigwams. But they make up a small minority of listings.Alistair Danter, the project manager of the Skye tourism management body SkyeConnect, says Airbnb listings on the island represent a variety of interests.“The trouble with any headline figures relating to Airbnb is that you don’t know which categories they relate to: some of these listings will be established businesses – B\u0026ampBs, self-catering hotels - that use the Airbnb platform listing when they have a gap, some will be listings for two or three pods on the same croft and others may well be new start-up businesses taking advantage of the opportunity that the Airbnb platform offers. Many of these options will not be housing stock from locals,” he said.Danter describes the company as “both saint and sinner”.“It’s an effective platform that has given people an opportunity to start a viable business or earn some extra money in an area of the country where wages are low. The downside is that it is grossly unfair that you can open up your house to guests without needing a single check, certification or public liability insurance. Some form of regulation is required.”In St Ives, Cornwall, where there are 18.5 Airbnb listings per 100 homes, independent councillor Andrew Mitchell said he worried about the lack of regulation. “All those B\u0026ampB owners and small hoteliers are having to pay £5,000 to £10,000 for a fire alarm system, £500-£1,000 a year for refuge collection, so there’s a bit of resentment from those operators that there isn’t a level playing field.”Airbnb says that it is working to make it easier for local authorities to enforce existing legislation and said this week: “We want to be good partners to cities and work together on a clear and simple host registration system that works for everyone.”In January, as a direct response to concerns raised by local residents of popular tourist destinations, the Scottish government announced that councils would be given new powers to introduce licencing schemes for short-term lets from 2021.Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman, whose campaigning work on short-term lets was prompted by stories of “mental anguish” from his Edinburgh constituents, welcomed the plans, but warned that there was still no clear picture of how many former homes had been given over to commercial uses. Wightman estimates that there may be as many as 5,000 in Edinburgh alone, and has recently launched an online tool which allows people to report short-term let properties operating in their community.“The growth in short-term lets is out of control in Edinburgh and of increasing concern across Scotland,” Wightman said, emphasising that Airbnb was only part of the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239e4dc4fa6a37128c1af54a5cdad0877d816402/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cf36f278535c45000d7714e78151c6c","title":"us campaign against huaweis 5g role in uk set to continue","story":"Issue raised by Trumps chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in meeting with Dominic CummingsThe White House campaign against Britain’s decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G network technology is expected to continue after a critical UK-US meeting at Downing Street broke up without reaching agreement on the issue.Sources said that the American delegation, led by acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, were unimpressed with attempts made by the prime minister’s chief aide Dominic Cummings to persuade them to work together on developing alternatives to the Chinese supplier.The US still wants the UK to reconsider and ban Huawei altogether, and believes that British officials including the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, have failed to appreciate the depth of their unhappiness with the decision.Although the US was keen not to upset the British by overtly briefing against them on the day of the meeting at No 10, the campaign of attrition in which senior White House officials warn of the security risks is expected to continue in the future. “The US was not encouraged by what they heard,” one source added.It is not clear how the impasse between the two countries can be resolved, although some believe the US wants to see if a revolt by Conservative backbenchers, including David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith, can force Boris Johnson to back down.Donald Trump spoke to Johnson on the phone a few hours after the meeting. However, to the surprise of the British, Huawei did not come up. Downing Street said the two discussed “a range of bilateral and international issues” and that they would meet at the G7 summit in the United States in June.The rebel backbenchers have called for Downing Street to commit to eliminating Huawei entirely in the years ahead, and it had been thought this could be grounds for a compromise between the UK and the US, because that would allow time for other suppliers and technologies to emerge.Huawei has become the leading supplier of 5G equipment in a market in which there are only two other significant competitors, Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland. Unusually for a high tech sector, there is no major US player.The night before the meeting, Mulvaney told an audience of students at the Oxford Union that there could be “a direct and dramatic impact” on intelligence sharing between the countries, and that the US remained “very much concerned”.The timing of those remarks irritated Downing Street, although it was the latest in a string of high level White House warnings about Huawei, made over the weekend by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, and Mark Esper, the defense secretary.Trump himself waded in to the row on Sunday night, calling the US ambassador to Germany on Sunday night to pass on his concerns. The diplomat said he had been instructed “to make clear that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level”.Britain’s security community has repeatedly said they believe that any risk that Huawei equipment could be compromised to allow mass surveillance by the Chinese state can be contained.Huawei already supplies equipment for British 3G and 4G networks, and its software is already routinely monitored by a special unit supervised by signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, whose main criticism is that the code is poorly designed.The British side was represented by Cummings and Sir Edward Lister, the prime minister’s chief of staff. Also present was US official Robert Blair, who specialises in international telecommunications policy, and is the lead administration official on Huawei.Downing Street said that Huawei was not the only topic of conversation. A spokesman said: “The meeting was with a senior officials, including Edward Lister. They discussed a range of issues, including coronavirus, UK-US trade, the UK’s decision on 5G and foreign policy matters”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e0244d0efb71345a94dad95b13f2d6a64206484/0_73_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f4f385a63e3a87e59a757cb75f7f38","title":"curb your enthusiasm metoo larry david","story":"In the latest season, Larry David is accused of sexual misconduct, a scenario which shows the comedy’s strengths and limitationsLike a bald, tirelessly kvetching Batman, Larry David returns to us right when we need him most. Curb Your Enthusiasm hasn’t graced HBO’s airwaves since 2017, and the last three years have given the people of America much fodder for the withering David touch. The 10th season premiere invoked the name of Trump right off the bat with an inspired plotline involving the infamous red Maga hats. Larry (the character, the man himself heretofore referred to as “David”) begins wearing one upon realizing that it’s a foolproof way to keep friends and strangers alike from interacting with him, the kernel of the gag being that he’d rather be left alone out of scorn than bothered by favor. It’s the essence of Larryism, honed to a single gesture and filtered through the day’s big headline.That’s typical of the show’s philosophy, which has always looked on misanthropy and self-interest as cleansing, righteous forces. David’s refusal to assign his onscreen avatar a side other than his own when he gets tangled up in any conflict bigger than himself may be his secret to success. Larry, for instance, refuses to take a side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because on the one hand, he’s a Jew through and through, but on the other, he’s recently been having very good sex with a Palestinian woman and he likes their local chicken joint. The only political allegiance that Larry has is to himself, and this regularly allows him to get his yuks in without veering into righteous sermonizing or outright reactionary thought. This tactic generally works, as long as Larry ends up the butt of the joke, but its application to the touchy subject of #MeToo humor this season has amplified both its strengths and limitations.For someone seemingly intent on finding the funny in the day’s hottest buttons, the recent revolution of exposure and cancelation would be too tempting a challenge to pass up. So David and Larry grab on to the third rail with both hands in the season premiere, launching a multi-episode arc that sticks a stubborn, boorish man in a highly delicate situation. Through a series of misunderstandings – Larry uses a tassel on his assistant’s shirt to clean his glasses without her permission, and later grazes a cater-waiter’s chest in an effort to get to her food – Larry lands in potentially career-ending hot water.Just as he brought the first two incidents on himself through social impropriety of a milder degree, he also ruins every opportunity to make good, insisting on an overly intimate “side-sit” on adjacent ends of a dinner table at what should be an apology meeting with his assistant. The key is that this is all Larry’s fault, right down to the culminating mishap, which sees the assistant choking to death in an elevator because Larry would rather let a woman suffocate than risk further accusation by giving her the Heimlich maneuver.David successfully threads the needle between over-earnest “very special episode” commentary and defensive wrongheadedness by detaching entirely. Where Brooklyn Nine-Nine attempted to broach the subject by awkwardly inserting one-liners between po-faced discussions of workplace power dynamics, Curb holds the imperative to get the laugh above all else. But he’s not laundering the unsavory opinions of those dinosaurs decrying the #MeToo movement as an overcorrection or overreaction, either. The show simply imagines the comic potential of the worst apologizer in the world ending up in a scenario that requires the world’s most delicate apology. (Later, Larry makes a bid at saving face by speaking at a conference with Laverne Cox, and his refusal to hug her because she has a cold comes off as transphobia.)But there’s also a solipsism in this tack, one that necessarily involves removing the political dimension from staunchly politicized material. David enjoys a significant degree of comfort both financially and professionally, qualities about which the show has never been shy. In this respect, it’s probably easy for David or co-showrunner Jeff Schaffer to place themselves above the fray, having as little personal skin in the game as they do. The lack of statement can be a glaring statement in itself, betraying neutrality as the ultimate privilege in times of crisis. Curb never hits the nihilistic lows of South Park and its steadfast belief that everyone else is stupid at least David’s a good enough sport to admit when he’s being a schmuck. Even so, these episodes leave a feeling of insubstantiality. David has managed to return year after year without losing his way, upholding a steep standard of comedic excellence year in and year out. As he gravitates toward the deep end of discourse, however, that may not be enough. It’s just a bit jarring to see a show approaching its most talked-about topic with nothing to say — beyond “oy gevalt,” that is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917c47f3483efdb30e6c0274dda7888befc8a70b/0_25_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c648db609d9b397ed027cd58b91b789","title":"democratic convention bernie sanders superdelegates nominee","story":"The Vermont senator was alone in saying he would back whoever won a plurality of delegates – with others open to superdelegates tipping the balance for another candidate at the conventionAmid the Mike Bloomberg pile-on and the Pete Buttigieg-Amy Klobuchar squabbling, there was a key point that slipped by almost unnoticed during Wednesday’s tumultuous Democratic debate – one that could potentially prevent Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee.Towards the end, each of the six candidates was asked if – at the Democratic national convention this summer in Milwaukee – they would support the person who has won the most delegates – even if that person hasn’t achieved a majority.Five of the candidates said they would not. The Democratic socialist and Vermont senator said he would.It might seem a wonky, opaque detail, but it raises the prospect that Sanders, who has a commanding lead in the polls and has emerged as the frontrunner, could win the most pledged delegates – those allocated on the basis of votes during the marathon Democratic primaries – but be swindled, at the last, by the Democratic party elite.That’s because of superdelegates.Superdelegates, who are chosen by the central Democratic party, are different from pledged delegates, who are effectively voted for during the primaries. As of 20 February, Buttigieg is in the lead in terms of pledged delegates, with 22 to Sanders’ 21.But Sanders is better-placed than Buttigieg to pick up more pledged delegates in Nevada on Saturday and South Carolina the following week. He is also likely to add to his total again on Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, yielding a total of 1,357 delegates.If Sanders’ popularity endures, he could amass more delegates than his rivals by the time of the July convention, when the pledged delegates effectively vote for the nominee in a first round of voting that is meant to pick the nominee.Superdelegates, who in the past have aligned with the center, “establishment” wing of the Democratic party, will be free to wade in and vote for whomever they choose in this second ballot.With Sanders a resolute outsider in Democratic terms – he sits as an independent in the Senate, and had to sign a pledge last year committing to the party – he is unlikely to be a favorite of these party grandees.If the superdelegates vote for a more centrist figure, that could mean Sanders – even if he has secured a majority of votes in the primaries – would be pipped at the post, and not be the nominee.That’s why that moment in the Nevada debate was so important. Five of the candidates were effectively saying that even if they were losing at the Democratic national convention, they were open to the unelected superdelegates weighing in in their favor, potentially gifting them the nomination even though they did not win the support of the most actual voters in the whole race.It’s a prospect that would leave Sanders’ supporters irate – and even upset some non-supporters. Marianne Williamson, Sanders’ erstwhile rival for the nomination, was among those to criticize the process on Wednesday night.“The Democratic Party should be on notice: if you even think about using superdelegates to take the nomination from someone who has the plurality of delegates going into Milwaukee, we the people will not take it lying down,” Williamson wrote on Twitter.The superdelegate rules were changed in 2018 after criticism from Sanders and others. Until then, superdelegates could vote for whomever they chose in the first round of the convention, and an overwhelming majority supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, although she was also ahead of Sanders in pledged delegates and rank-and-file votes.At the time, Sanders called the 2018 change “an important step forward in making the Democratic party more open, democratic and responsive to the input of ordinary Americans”.With the prospect of superdelegate interference once again looming over his presidential chances, however, it is likely Sanders feels more reforms are needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/063c66e56d2758fa8f5b289e0200f3de7c68fd98/0_158_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a16db07fcc6e78c866d91eb6568447e1","title":"irish parliament set for stalemate in attempt to form new government","story":"Taoiseach will continue as caretaker leader after inconclusive sitting of Dáil ÉireannLeo Varadkar has resigned as taoiseach after Ireland’s hung parliament entered deadlock over the choice of a new premier.Varadkar submitted his resignation to Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, on Thursday night after a tempestuous but inconclusive sitting of Dáil Éireann, which met for the first time since the 8 February election. It adjourned until 5 March, giving party leaders three weeks to try to form a ruling coalition.The Fine Gael leader and his administration will continue to work in their current roles until successors are appointed but will avoid major policy decisions, financial allocations and public appointments “unless absolutely necessary”, and only then after consultation with other parties.Varadkar, the Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were nominated for taoiseach by their parties but all, as expected, fell far short of an 80-seat majority in the 160-seat chamber.McDonald won the most votes, 45, with 84 against and 29 abstentions. Martin won 41, with 97 against and 19 abstentions. Varadkar won 36, with 107 against and 16 abstentions. Ryan won 12, with 115 against and 28 abstentions.The 33rd dáil opened amid pomp and ceremony but the stalemate put it on ice after just a day, reflecting a deeply fragmented political landscape.Vitriolic exchanges between party leaders after the votes underlined the challenge of forming a government, a process that could take weeks or even months, and end in another election.Martin reiterated his opposition to working with Sinn Féin in an onslaught on the party’s links to the IRA during and since the Troubles. “When I raised the issue of the systematic cover-up of child abuse by the Provisional IRA, I was called a lowlife by deputies present here today,” he said. He also accused Sinn Féin of antisemitism and peddling a manifesto of spendthrift populism.McDonald hit back, saying Martin shared a cabinet table with colleagues convicted of corruption and that he reflected an old, discredited duopoly that sought to ignore voters’ desire for change. “I see we still live rent-free in Micheál Martin’s narrow and bitter mind,” she said. “Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have had the run of this place for a century, and by Christ, they’re not prepared to let go.”Martin said he would ask Varadkar in coming days to engage in government formation talks, raising the possibility of an unprecedented coalition between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century.However, Fine Gael appears determined to go into opposition, saying it needs to regroup after nine years in office and a hammering from voters, raising doubts about any deal with Fianna Fail. Varadkar has also ruled out a deal with Sinn Féin.In the election, Fianna Fáil won 38 seats, Sinn Féin won 37, Fine Gael 35 and the Greens 12, with small leftwing parties and independents sharing the rest.Fianna Fáil’s slim advantage ended when one of its TDs (MPs), Seán Ó Fearghaíl, was re-elected as speaker, or Ceann Comhairle, whittling the party’s voting bloc down to 37.Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition. However, there is widespread acceptance that a stable government will require two of the three big parties.Some newly elected politicians made colourful arrivals. The brothers Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, independent TDs from Kerry, played traditional music on Kildare street.

The whine of Russian and Syrian government warplanes had got too close for comfort in the last few days, and the thuds of bombs and artillery fire were scaring Odai al-Hussein’s 7-month-old son, Yahya.Odai and his wife Banan spent two weeks agonising over whether to leave home and take Syria’s M5 highway north, into the unknown. But in the end, the looming violence of Bashar al-Assad’s new campaign against Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in the country, led them to pack up the car. Hussein’s father cried as he bid farewell to his house.The family joined 900,000 others who have made their way up the highway in the largest displacement of people to date in Syria’s long war. For civilians who now have nowhere else to flee, the northbound M5 was the route to relative safety. Now totally under the control of Assad’s forces, the highway is instead the regime’s road to victory.The M5, or Syria’s “international road”, threads all of Syria’s major cities and six provinces together. The 450km (280 miles) artery joins the political capital Damascus to the economic centre of Aleppo. Stretching as far as Turkey in the north and the southern Jordanian border, which then linked Syria to the Gulf states, the M5 was essential for the movement of wheat and cotton, carrying an estimated $25m in goods and commodities every day before the war broke out in 2011.Recapturing the M5 has always been a high priority for Assad. Sections of the vital highway have been in the hands of opposition and jihadist fighters for the last eight years, but with Russia’s help, the Syrian government has slowly clawed back control since 2014, emptying towns and cities along the route via a series of blistering air campaigns and sieges.By the summer of 2018, Idlib, a rural farming province in the country’s northeast, was the only part of Syria out of Assad’s control. The population of the city of Idlib and the surrounding countryside has swollen from 1 million to approximately 3 million as people afraid to wait for regime troops to arrive in their neighbourhoods have fled north in wave after wave of displacement.Even though the area was protected by a de-escalation deal brokered by Turkey – which backs some opposition groups – and Assad’s allies in Moscow, part of the M5 cuts through the Idlib countryside. And in December, Damascus launched a ferocious new campaign to recapture the last slivers of the road, finally taking the last rebel-controlled section around the village of Khan al-Assal last week.The regime victory has come at a high price for civilians. Bumper-to-bumper traffic has clogged the M5 and other roads leading north towards the closed Turkish border, those who can afford the fuel fleeing in cars, motorbikes and flatbed trucks, often taking no more than what they can carry.Even these escape routes have become hazardous options: sniper and artillery fire targeting civilian convoys has killed at least 15 people. So far, the regime campaign has killed more than 300 in bombings that have hit medical facilities, bakeries and other civilian infrastructure in the last three months. Footage has emerged on social media of regime troops allegedly desecrating graves in newly-retaken rebel towns.Regaining full control of the M5 is a major victory for Assad, according to Danny Makki, a Syrian analyst. “The highway’s recapture will inevitably galvanise the Assad government both economically and strategically, despite the losses they have suffered in men and equipment in their numerous attempts to secure it,” he said.“It also alleviates the logistical nightmare of supplying Aleppo and Syria’s embattled north, which has relied on reinforcements and supplies through dangerous and poorly-maintained alternatives.”The Syrian president himself made a rare televised address on Tuesday following the capture of the road, congratulating his troops and vowing to press ahead with the campaign.“This liberation does not mean the end of war and it does not mean… our enemies will surrender,” he said.“But it means that we rubbed their noses in the dirt as a prelude for complete victory and ahead of their defeat sooner or later. We should not rest, but continue to prepare for coming battles.”For the 3 million civilians cowering in Idlib, his words carry a terrifying weight. The situation is already desperate, with the UN and aid agencies warning the area could face “the worst humanitarian disaster of the century”. Turkish attempts to repel the regime advance with an influx of 12,000 troops have so far led to nothing.Aid response efforts are at breaking point. On Wednesday footage emerged on social media of displaced people tired of waiting ransacking an aid warehouse and grabbing what they can. Hundreds of thousands more are camped out in tents and other substandard accommodation on the Turkish border in freezing winter conditions, begging Turkish soldiers to open the border.Hussein counts himself and his family as lucky: they have managed to find an unfurnished apartment in Azaz, which is under Turkish control, although they are already longing to go home.“I heard that regime soldiers set fire to the houses of those who oppose the regime in Saraqeb and I saw pictures of soldiers looting. Our future is unclear,” Hussein said.“I don’t think I am afraid to die in the war, in bombing. But I know for certain I can never live alongside the men who fight for Assad – the animals who have done this to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8419dde45a357286e9c4bd26ad14f7be3355771/0_135_5499_3299/master/5499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=712e9834629dd741de6cb5b7c16b907f","title":"paris launches emergency bed bugs hotline","story":"New campaign includes advice on how to prevent and treat an infestation, and a number to call for expert helpThe French government launched a campaign Thursday, complete with an emergency number, to combat an influx of unwelcome visitors that have left Parisians in despair: bedbugs that have settled in homes and hotels to feed, uninvited, on human blood.After disappearing from France in the 1950s, the insects have made a resurgence, according to the ministry of housing, which cited international travel and growing resistance to insecticide as the main causes.“We can all be affected,” the government warned on a webpage dedicated to the problem, complete with advice on how to prevent and treat an infestation, and a number to call for expert help.The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is found in temperate climates in the United States and parts of Europe.The six-legged pest posed only a minor nuisance after the second world war because of the widespread use of insecticides such as DDT. But the banning of such potent poisons, because they were too dangerous, hailed a bed bug revival.By the late 1990s, they were thriving in New York and a 2010 outbreak saw them invade high-end apartment buildings, hotels, even clothing stores like the lingerie outlet Victoria’s Secret.There has also been an explosion of bed bugs in Paris.The insects cost billions of dollars annually to exterminate by businesses and homeowners.In 2016, a study found that bed bugs had become resistant to pesticides.Another study the following year said the insects sought out human scents and snuggled up in worn clothes before tagging along home, explaining their meteoric spread around the world.They hide in linen by day and come out at night to bite people, often while they are sleeping, leaving red, itchy welts. They do not transmit disease.In Paris, extermination experts say 400,000 addresses including hotels, apartments and houses were treated in 2018, the latest year for which information is available.This represented a third more than the previous year.Illustrating how annoying the issue has become, bed bugs have even featured in the Paris 2020 electoral campaign, with mayoral hopeful Benjamin Griveaux promising to clean up the capital in 100 days.The plan of the candidate, who has since bowed out over a sex-tape scandal, included specialised anti-pest “brigades” targeting bed bugs, rats and cockroaches, which would intervene free of charge for low-income households, and at the lowest market price for others."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4177834.1582096911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a russian cruiser with cannibal rats what other ghost ships could be out there","story":"A ghost ship was washed up onto the rocks off east Cork by Storm Dennis on Sunday, after drifting across the Atlantic over the last year. Video: Irish Coast Guard\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Russian liner Lyubov Orlova: ‘Somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland.’The running aground of “ghost ship” MV Alta, on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork on Sunday, was not the first time such a derelict vessel has haunted our shores.In 2014 there were reports that the abandoned former Soviet cruise liner Lyubov Orlova was off the Irish coast bringing with it ominous headlines warning of “cannibal rats” aboard a “ghost ship” heading our way.The Irish Coast Guard on Tuesday said it suspects the liner has probably sunk but is “still vigilant” in relation to it. The 4,200-tonne ship was once the glittering choice of Soviet holidaymakers and later wealthy Russians touring the Artic and Antarctic.It is one of a number of ‘ghost ships’, unmanned but still afloat at last sighting, the whereabouts of which are now unknown.The 100m long Lyubov Orlova was seen adrift off the coast of Newfoundland in February 2013. The ship had been sold for scrap and taken under tow from St John’s, heading for the Dominican Republic. But less than a day into the journey the tow line broke and the ship drifted into international waters.As National Geographic put it in March 2014, “somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland”.Finding such a ship in the ocean is\u0026nbspnot easy. The International Maritime Organisation’s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires international ships, with 300 or more gross tonnage and all passenger ships, to carry beacons which function as automatic identification systems (AIS).Historical AIS data is also used for analysing the vessels movements on a global scale. In the case of the Lyubov Orlova, it would probably have its transponders off because power ran out. In addition, satellite recorders are not able to easily find a ship in the vast Atlantic unless they know a precise area in which to look.In its efforts to find the cruise ship the Irish Coast Guard combined AIS tracking with radar allowing it to “see” the ghosts . First, radar satellites scanned vast areas of the sea surface, where vessels showed up as blips as on a radar screen. These were then cross-referenced with AIS satellite maps, which showed the positions of all the active ships. In theory, the ghost ship would be the only radar blip not broadcasting a signal. During efforts to find the Russian cruiser an illegal fishing vessel near Scotland which had its transponder turned off\u0026nbspwas discovered.But all attempts to locate the MV Lyubov Orlova by the Irish Coast Guard proved unsuccessful.In 2016 another unmanned vessel washed up on Irish shores. In November of that year a makeshift solar-powered houseboat landed on a beach in Co Mayo after drifting across the Atlantic from Canada. Authorities said the owner of the 20ft timber and polystyrene boat was intending to sail on the “floating caravan”, but was talked out of it before it broke loose from its mooring in Newfoundland. It turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.In December 2000 a Spanish boat, Zorro Zaurre, drifted 140 miles to the southwest Irish coast before foundering on rocks yards from where its sister ship, Nuestra Senora de Gardotza, sank 10 years earlier at Roancarrig lighthouse in Bantry Bay, Co Cork. The 13 crew members had been airlifted a month earlier after the vessel sprang a leak.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4180164.1582236503!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il and sinn f%C3%A9in leaders round on each other in bitter d%C3%A1il clash","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe bitter exchanges between the two party leaders followed a lengthy debate and voting on the position of taoiseach. Photographs: Nick BradshawThe  and Gareth ChaneyCollins Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin renewed his opposition to talks with Sinn Féin on Thursday in a swingeing attack on the party after voting on each of the four leaders for taoiseach was completed.But Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald accused him of a “diatribe and vitriol” that had served him very badly in the election.And she warned that she would not tolerate the “grossly offensive” suggestion that the citizens who voted for her party should be left in perpetuity on the sidelines “because Micheál doesn’t like us”.The bitter exchanges between the two party leaders followed a lengthy debate and voting on the position of taoiseach in which Ms McDonald received the highest number of votes.She said, to applause from her colleagues, that for the first time a nominee from outside Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael managed to garner the greatest number of votes for the position of taoiseach. Mr Martin said Sinn Féin’s “efforts to legitimise a murderous sectarian campaign keeps alive a narrative which is used by dissidents to legitimise their campaigns – but this is more fundamentally about today”. He said that “every single time an issue arises about the behaviour of people associated with the Provisionals movement and today’s Sinn Féin the response is to attack and dismiss”.“Only when the evidence keeps piling up and the political pressure grows is there any movement. Offers to meet are expressed and calls for co-operation with law enforcement are issues – but nothing ever happens,” he said. “No one ever comes forward. Victims never get justice.”He said “repeated anti-Semitism is brushed aside as a small slip”. “Let’s not forget that there have already been 27 representatives that have resigned from Sinn Féin citing systemic bullying.“Aggressive online abuse towards political opponents is not an oversight it is a strategy.“And of course, there is an approach to government which has received almost no attention in the Dublin-based media but has raised enormous concerns in Northern Ireland.”Front groupsHe said the use of front groups to receive public funding, the forcing of employees and representatives to sign over wages to the party and the operation of a shadow system of control over ministerial decisions are not inventions of political opponents. “They have been documented in great detail.”The “glorifying of the Provisional IRA isn’t an accident of one Deputy’s exuberance”, as Ms McDonald had claimed, he said.“She herself has praised Provisional IRA units and when she ends speeches with ‘Tiocfaidh ár lá’ she knows full and well what the use of that phrase means.”But the Sinn Féin leader accused him of having a “very narrow and bitter mind”. He proposed to “continue the diatribe and vitriol that sustained him and served him very badly in the election campaign”.Ms McDonald said that two parties but Fianna Fáil in particular decided in “an arrogant, dismissive, self-righteous way to disregard entirely the representative of more than half a million people”.She said there was an element of belief that it was “capricious nonsense” by the electorate to vote for Sinn Féin but nothing could be further from the truth.“Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have run the show for almost a century and by Christ they’re not minded to let it go,” she said. “And that really is what this is all about.”People had told her very clearly that they were voting for her party to be in government. It was not a protest vote but for a different government.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party would “stand by the State and republic” and “if we’re needed to give the country political stability and good governance we’re willing to talk to other parties about that”.But he said “the onus is in the first instance is on those who made enormous promises of change”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means.

Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

It means that users are forced to stick with Apple\u0027s own Mail and Music apps as the default choice on its software, for instance.But the company is considering allowing apps made by other companies to take those roles instead, in what would be one of the most momentous changes to come to the iOS platform, according to a new report from Bloomberg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt would mean that people would be able to open an email link on their phone and actually send the message in the Gmail app, for instance. Or it could allow people to use Spotify from Apple\u0027s HomePod speakers, which at the moment favour Apple Music.It comes amid questions over the way that companies such as Apple use their platforms to enforce their dominance in the tech industry. Apple has faced questions over the power of the App Store, for instance, which it\u0026nbspcompletely controls\u0026nbspand is the only way for apps to get onto the iPhone.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

But they have never had the same powers as Apple\u0027s own apps.Apple’s new cheaper phone \u0027to arrive soon\u0027 despite coronavirusThat means that users can download third-party browsers like Google\u0027s Chrome or Firefox, for instance, but that clicking on a link from a text message will always take them to Apple\u0027s own Safari. Likewise a user might have Microsoft Outlook or Gmail installed, and can use them for emails, but clicking an email link will still always bring up Apple\u0027s own Mail apps.On Android, by comparison, people are able to choose which browser, messaging app, email client or music platform they would prefer to use, and that will be set as the default. Even though Android phones come with Google apps installed, people are able to stop using them more easily.Any changes could arrive in iOS 14, Bloomberg reported. That update is likely to be revealed at Apple\u0027s WWDC event in summer, followed by a public release around September, at roughly the same time as the release of the new iPhone.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

May Bulman talks to those kicked out of Britain about the difficulty of\u0026nbspstarting againImagine being ripped from everyone and everything in your life, locked in a cell, then flown across the globe to a country you barely know. You have no friends or family there, no job, and sometimes struggle to even be understood by the locals. This is your new life.That’s the situation facing some of those flown to Jamaica on a controversial charter flight this month, many of whom – though they remain Jamaican nationals – had lived in Britain since they were children. One told The Independent he had only a single\u0026nbspmemory of the Caribbean island:\u0026nbspbrushing his teeth as a small child.The mass deportation, which had intended to return around 50 people before the courts limited the number to 17, has shone a light on human suffering caused by Britain’s returns system, which sees thousands deported each year, often with limited access to legal help to defend their right to stay in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne man struggling to build a life after deportation is Tremayne Brown, 26, who was on a charter flight to Jamaica in 2017. He had lived in Britain since the age of six, having moved from Kingston’s Rose Town to south London with his father after his mother, brother and sister were killed by gangs. His father went to prison soon after their arrival – and was later deported – meaning Tremayne was put into care. No attempts were made to regularise his status in the UK.“I was leaving care and I was meant to get my own place and find a job, but then my social worker told me I wasn’t allowed to work, and they weren’t able to give me somewhere to live either, because of my status,” says Tremayne. “I was suddenly classed as an illegal alien.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

But he was not allowed to work. His girlfriend and their baby son needed financial support, so he was pushed into crime.“I was stuck in a place where I wasn’t allowed to work and I couldn’t get anywhere to live. What am I meant to do? I regret it every day. If I didn’t do that, I would be there with my son right now.”Aged 18, Tremayne was convicted for supplying class A drugs and commercial robbery, serving three years in jail. He did his time, then was transferred to a removal centre and issued deportation orders. He says that on entering detention he was told his removal had been cancelled, so did not contact his solicitor. But a week later, he was put on a flight.“One night they came to my door and said, ‘Pack your bags.’ When I was on the plane I called the solicitor and he said, ‘Why didn’t you ring me, I could have cancelled your ticket,’ but that it was too late.

Though he lives with his father, Tremayne yearns to see his loved ones in Britain, particularly his son who, now aged six, has spent the majority of his life without his dad, having to make do with video calls.“He always asks me, ‘Dad, where are you?’ And if I’m coming back and why I left. It’s hard to explain it to him. He might hear his father’s voice and see him, but in reality you want him there in front of you. Through his childhood I haven’t been there. I haven’t been able to take him to the park. Those little things are important and have a knock-on effect on him as a child, having to grow up and say, ‘My father wasn’t there.’ It will make him bitter.”The Uncertain Kingdom - the groundbreaking anthology of twenty short films is released in cinemas 3\u0026nbspApril.\u0026nbspTremayne struggled to find work, largely because of his reputation as being one of the “deportee boys” who had their chance and lost it. His qualifications were not recognised in Jamaica, but he found a job at a holding company. He says the stigma still weighs on his shoulders. His British accent means he is constantly asked where he comes from and why he was deported.“I have had to start again from scratch. You spend your whole life in one place and then you have to adapt yourself again. Nothing is easy, but you have to try,” he says. “Some days are really hard. I miss my son, I miss my foster mum, I miss the scenery. Having been a young boy and grown up there, I class myself as British. Everything I know is from Britain. I never learned anything from Jamaica.”Another deportee, Chevon Brown, was forcibly removed on a charter flight last February on the basis of a driving offence he committed aged 21 – something he describes as a “stupid mistake”. He had moved to the UK when he was 14 and has no close relatives in Jamaica.As a qualified barber who started working at the age of 16, the 24-year-old had hoped to find a job fairly easily. But he says his name has been tarnished by the insinuation by British politicians that everyone on the charter plane was a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.Chevon rarely leaves the house because he says he can feel animosity from people in the street, and he has sleepless nights worrying about his future.“I’ve asked for jobs, told them I’m qualified, but after they’ve heard my name, they don’t want to employ me. They say how can they trust me when I’ve been deported,” he tells The Independent. “People think we’re going to come here and cause major crimes. Most people think I’m a murderer, rapist or drug trafficker, which I’m not. I went to prison for dangerous driving and I completely regret it because I never knew I’d be serving double punishment for one stupid mistake.”The proof that ministers haven’t learnt the lessons from WindrushChevon, who grew up in Oxford, served seven months after admitting speeding in an uninsured car. It happened after a heated argument with his housemate, when he took the car out and drove away from police.“I knew what I was doing was wrong in the moment,” he says. “I was genuinely scared. I wish I had stopped, given them the key, got arrested and that be that. I had no idea that this would be the aftermath of driving away from the police. If I ever come back to England I don’t want any involvement with police. I just want to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to get a barbershop, get a mortgage on a house, start planning a future, get a car, all those things.“But right now, I’m paying two, three years after the actual thing. I’ve gone to jail, done my time, and years later I still can’t actually move on with my life. I feel like I’m still in prison. It’s worse than prison, because I can’t see my family and friends. I feel like I’m stuck. My whole reputation has been messed up by one silly mistake.”“My dad is getting more and more stressed. He’s got health problems. My 18-year-old brother’s not listening to anyone any more. There’s been a ripple effect from what’s happened to me. My little brother keeps asking me, ‘When are you coming home?’ I can’t give him a definite answer about that. I wanted to set a good example. But right now I feel like I’m actually being a weight on my family, because of all this negative attention that’s been drawn towards me.“I feel more British than Jamaican. My dad brought me to England and said this was where I was going to be living for the rest of my life. So I ed into the new society and this is who I am today. Most people try to tell me to speak Patois, but I feel comfortable speaking English. When I speak the Jamaican language I feel like I have to put it on. I don’t want to put it on.”The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connectionsWhile charter flights to Jamaica have garnered media attention in the wake of the Windrush scandal, forced deportations from the UK take place throughout the year to countries across the globe, with 9,461 people removed in 2018 and 12,049 the year before – in addition to around 20,000 iniduals removed through the voluntary returns route. An estimated 2,000 of those forcibly removed are put on planes privately chartered by the Home Office, of which a total of 20 charter planes left Britain last year, with the destinations including Albania, Pakistan, Nigeria, France and Ghana.Kweku Adoboli, 39, was deported to Ghana in 2018 after having lived in Britain since the age of 12. In a highly publicised court case, he had been sentenced to seven years behind bars in 2012 after losing £1.4bn while working for Swiss bank UBS. The banker, who had a British partner at the time, was sentenced to five years in jail. Two days after he was convicted, he was informed that he was liable to automatic deportation.“All the way from being arrested through to just after I was convicted immigration didn’t cross my mind. The level of stress goes through the roof,” says Kweku, who now lives with his parents in Accra. “Suddenly, the battle’s not over. I can’t just sit in and do my time and go home.“The pressure in the relationship started to go up, because now she’s thinking, ‘Okay, so I’ve stood by him through this fight, now what? What if I keep fighting if he’s going to get deported anyway?’”Kweku had left Ghana aged four, when his parents moved to the Middle East for work. He is grateful to have his parents and other relatives now in the country, but devastated at how his relationships in Britain – including with his now ex-girlfriend and many friends – have broken down since his return.“It’s the inability of being able to get on a plane and be there for someone,” he explains. “The distance creates massive tension in the relationship. You have to increasingly distance yourself from these really close relationships. The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connections, which then leads to depression.”‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingAfter arriving in Ghana, Kweku spent about nine months sitting in his bedroom, unable to leave the house. He developed a number of physical manifestations of the trauma he had been through. “My body started to swell up a lot,” he says. “We thought it was a heart problem so had a lot of heart tests. My face just blew up like a balloon, my legs were like elephant trunks,”The Ghanaian national acknowledges that he was relatively lucky on his return that, unlike the Jamaican deportees, he was welcomed with open arms by both his family and the country as a whole, who gave him what he describes as a “massive embrace”.“Because of the violence and the cruelty of what happened to me, I think Ghana went, ‘This is a son of Ghana, a son of Africa, why should anyone be treated this way?’ Random people on the street would stop me. Everyone recognised me. They were all saying welcome home,” he says, adding: “My stamina is not back and I’m still dealing with adrenal failure, so I still have to do a lot of work to deal with my stress, but I’m getting back to the point where I’m starting to contribute again.”But Kweku still remembers what he went through on during his deportation: “Of all that I went through, none of it was as bad as sitting at the back of a plane with five G4S guards. I was hyperventilating, sobbing non-stop for four hours.”Branded “foreign national offenders” and “illegal immigrants” by the Home Office\u0026nbspas they wait in cells to be taken away, these deportees are characterised as hardened criminals. But for Tremayne, Chevon and Kweku, these terms – and the trauma – ripple through their lives for years to come as they try to start again, thousands of miles from the place they call home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I just don’t think it’s going to end well’A Conservative MP has hit out at Dominic Cummings for his “brutal” attack on the BBC and accused him of having a “nasty streak” that will backfire on the party.Huw Merriman, who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on the BBC, attacked what he called “ideological trench warfare” against the corporation, in a recent No 10 briefing.An unnamed adviser vowed to “whack” the BBC by abolishing the licence fee and forcing it to sell off many TV and radio stations – an attack widely attributed to Mr Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief aide.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’s fair enough to say we need to have a conversation about whether the licence fee is going to still be relevant in 2027. There’s nothing wrong with that. I agree with that conversation.Dominic Cummings’ influence in No 10 hasn’t been reined in“But this whole thing about ‘whacking’, about ‘it’s got hundreds of radio stations, and we’re going to close them down’. It doesn’t, it has 63, and so, therefore, the facts aren’t correct.“And there seems to be a sort of nasty streak behind some of these briefings. And if our whole mantra is to try and unite the country, after the difficulties we’ve had over the last couple of years – and this government has a mandate to do that – then I’m not sure why we need to be quite so isive in the tone and language that we’re using. I just don’t think it’s going to end well.”The comments come amid growing criticism of Mr Cummings, the former Vote Leave chief, over the hiring of Andrew Sabisky, who was forced to quit over his past comments about black people and eugenics.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet reshuffle: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out  Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Nearby trees started to look ashen.Before long, the cows, drinking from the water, started to change in appearance. They developed stringy tails, malformed hooves, huge legions in their coats, hair loss, humped backs, blackened teeth and receding eyes, and were plagued by constant diarrhoea and have thick white slime leaking from their mouths.Then they began acting strangely. Rather than walk over to be milked like usual, they’d aggressively charge - in an odd, bow-legged fashion - at the farmers and often have to be shot.One day, Tennant found two deer and two dead cattle not far from the river. Blood was inexplicably running from their noses and mouths. He also discovered a deceased calf with unusually bright blue eyes.After losing  of his herd, he decided to dissect the cattle to see what was going on inside. When he sliced open the organs - the liver, heart, stomachs, kidneys and gallbladder - they were discoloured green.Tennant raised the alarm in , approaching everyone from local lawyers and politicians to vets and doctors.Yet they were terried of going against the revered DuPont, who had given work to so much of the local community.Desperate, he turned to a lawyer called Bilott, an environmental lawyer at corporate Cincinnati firm Taft Stettinius  Hollister he had first met as a child.A sceptical Bilott agreed to meet the baseball cap-wearing farmer - but he was left aghast at the goings on at the farm, the evidence of which was shown to him on a homemade video tape.Tenannt told him that he thought something from DuPonts landfill site had contaminated the river water - and was poisoning his animals.‘‘There’s something really bad going on here, he later recalled, the New York Times reports. It just felt like the right thing to do. I felt a connection to those folks.’’But by agreeing to take on DuPont, the law firm was put in uncharted territory - they usually defended such chemical companies, rather than sued them.Bilott filed against DuPont in summer of . In response, the company sent a team of vets to the farm - whose report blamed the family for killing their livestock.This infuriated the Tennants, who were already being ostracised by the local community for daring to take on DuPont.People would walk out of restaurants when they entered. They had to change churches three times.Bilott waded through piles of documents, but could still find nothing to explain the dying herd. ‘‘We were getting frustrated,’’ he admitted.Then the lawyer stumbled across something he had never seen before in his entire career.Dupont had sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency mentioning a substance in the landfill called PFOA.A chemistry expert he had used put him on the right track - it was perfluorooctanoic acid.Bilott got a court order in the autumn of  that forced the company to hand over boxes of files, including confidential studies conducted by DuPont scientists.‘‘I started seeing a story,’’ Bilott said. ‘‘It became apparent what was going on: They had known for a long time that this stuff was bad.’’He discovered that in  Dupont began purchasing PFOA to use in the manufacturing of Teflon - the non-stick coating for pans and other cookware.Despite clear instructions that it be disposed of carefully, over several decades they pumped the excess powder through pipes into the Ohio River.They also dumped , tons of PFOA-laced sludge into ‘‘digestion ponds’’ - or unlined pits.This meant that the chemical could seep into the ground and straight into the local water supply.Clearly concerned about what they had been doing, DuPont commissioned medical studies on PFOA.They found it could increase the size of the liver in rats and rabbits, and that a high concentration had made it into the blood of employees.They also tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon ision - of seven births, two had eye defects. In  they realised that it was present in the water supply.A local woman called Darlene Kigerhad been married to a chemist at DuPont’s PFOA lab.She recalled how he would come home from work with fever, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting - a group of ailments common among the workforce who nicknamed it Teflon flu.Aged , she had to have an emergency hysterectomy after warnings from her husband about washing his work clothes.She admitted: ‘‘I asked myself, what does DuPont have to do with our drinking water ’’Another person who appears as themselves in the new film is Bucky Bailey, , who was born with a single nostril and a deformed face.His mum had worked in direct contact with chemicals at DuPont. “They tried to blame me, telling me that it was something I did,” she told the \"BBC last year.By the s, DuPont knew that PFOA - which had also been shown to be pretty much indestructible - caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumours in lab animals, and a study linked it to testicular cancer in workers.Despite this, they dumped , tons of PFOA into Dry Run Landfill - and when they tested the water running into the Tennants’ land it contained dangerously high levels.They kept this knowledge a secret from both the public and the EPA for years.In August  the Tennants settled, but Bilott was still angry.“DuPont had for decades been actively trying to conceal their actions,” he said. “They knew this stuff was harmful, and they put it in the water anyway.And the lawyer was worried what it was doing to humans. He demanded that steps be taken to regulate PFOA and provide clean water to those living near the factory, and sent letters to key authorities.However, the problem was much bigger.Independent tests confirmed that PFOA was in the water supply being used by , people - and had been for decades. However, until it was recognised by the government as a toxin, it wasn’t illegal.In , the EPA released additional findings. It didn’t affect just those who drunk the contaminated local water, but also any members of the general public who cooked with Teflon kitchenware. PFOA had even been found in American blood banks.DuPont agreed in  to install filtration plants in the six affected water districts and to pay a cash award of m .After seven years, in , scientists revealed that there was a ‘‘probable link’’ between PFOA and six diseases - including kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.Today, it is estimated by researchers that it is present in the blood of  per cent of Americans due to contamination of the water supply and from coming into contact with Teflon on multiple household products.PFOA is indestructible and will never disintegrate, and is part of a group of compounds used in manufacturing now called forever chemicals.DuPont opened a new facility in North Carolina to make PFOA and spun its activities into a new venture called Chemours.Last year, \" reported that both companies - as well as a third M, who had supplied PFOA to DuPont initially - had denied before US lawmakers that they were responsible for contamination of toxic “forever chemicals”.Despite the reluctance of companies to accept wrongdoing, the local community had won.‘‘There was relief,’’ Bilott said. We were able to deliver what we had promised to these folks seven years earlier.Especially since, for all those years, DuPont had been saying that we were lying, trying to scare and mislead people.’’Dark Water is released in UK cinemas on Friday th February.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where.

The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

Will this plan do much to bring down the overall immigration numbers as the Tories have long promised EXTINCTION Rebellion “activists” who dug up a lawn at Cambridge University are nothing more than virtue-signalling thugs.If lads from a local estate were caught vandalising such hallowed grounds, they’d be roundly rebuked. But some — thankfully not the cops, who have made two arrests — want to make excuses for the children of middle-class dons.We sympathise with the general cause: recent floods are a timely reminder that action on climate change can’t wait.But how does destroying the hard work of grafting gardeners win over anyone to their side If Extinction Rebellion activists want to make themselves useful, they can head up North and help out with Storm Dennis relief efforts.If not, they should skedaddle before they embarrass themselves any further.NEW Conservative MP Ric Holden is bang on the money: the toilet tax takes the... proverbial. Because of a weird loophole in the law, public toilets are liable for business rates.That means councils which own public toilets have to stump up the considerable cost of running them — and a whacking great tax on top of that.Councillors don’t like their precious cash being sucked down the pan, so are falling over each other to shut them.And the results have been disastrous for those with medical issues that make public lavs a godsend.According to the Royal Society of Public Health, one in five people don’t leave their homes as often as they would like to because they can’t be confident of finding a loo when they need one.If Rishi Sunak is looking to prove he’s got his head screwed on, scrapping the toilet tax would be a good place to start.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was one of the issues on which Mr Cummings and Sajid Javid disagreed before the latter quit as Chancellor last week.But Mr Javid’s replacement, Rishi Sunak, is a No loyalist and thought unlikely to block any attempt to end the freeze on March .During the election, the PM told The Sun he had “absolutely no intention” of raising fuel duty.But allies of Mr Johnson and the new Chancellor refused to rule it out yesterday. One said: “Rishi is still getting his feet under the desk. There have been no decisions yet.”Experts say a five-year freeze will cost the Government about £billion a year.But Tory MP Robert Halfon told The Sun: “This war on motorists has got to stop.”And Howard Cox, of the FairFuel campaign, said ministers should be trying to cut fuel duty and that any rise would be “devastating to hard-pressed motorists”.It is one of several tax rises being considered.In talks yesterday, the PM and Mr Sunak were said to be looking at raids on pension tax relief and council tax rises for the rich.No declined to comment.For smart city types blessed with excellent transport links, the increase would be a nuisance.But for the Prime Minister’s new wave of voters who switched to Tory — ordinary grafters living in towns and villages — it’d be downright disastrous.Everywhere you look, these people are being hammered by the cost of living.Millions of Brits work hard day and night, yet come home to brown envelopes with yet more demands to pay.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the outgoing leader will carry on in a caretaker role until a successor can be found. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan were all nominated for the role, however none of the leaders emerged with a majority vote. Ms McDonald emerged as the most popular candidate with  TDs backing her. However,  TDs voted in opposition with  TDs abstaining. Mr Varadkar secured  votes in favour of him becoming taoiseach, while  TDs voted in opposition. Mr Martin secured  votes in support, with  TDs voting against him.  Mr Ryan received  votes in support and  votes in opposition. Mr Varadkar will travel to the Aras an Uachtarain to resign from office, however he will continue to carry out his duties as Taoiseach in a caretaker capacity until a new taoiseach is appointed. He told the Dail: The responsibility is on all of us to ensure we provide good government, and indeed good opposition.  I think the onus is on those who have made enormous promises of change to the people during this election who are entrusted with that mandate to bring a programme of government for approval. If they cannot, they should say so and be upfront and honest about their failures and the empty promises they made. He said he will travel to Washington DC for the traditional St Patrickaposs Day events. Mr Martin accused Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald of using populist tropes as she accused them of failing to speak to her in government formation talks. Every party and deputy elected to this house has a right and a duty to represent the mandate they received. In order to deliver ing government, compromises have to be made and this is something we have been attacked for.  Demanding that others stay quiet as others abandon their core beliefs in order to grab power is notsomething we agree with. Whether or not you agree with Fianna Fail, we fought this election based on a clear set of principles and policies and that includes legitimate behaviour in a democratic republic. Mr Martin says he rejects Sinn Feinaposs manesto promises of increasing taxes on businesses and too many incompatibilities exist between the two parties.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will officially give up their roles as senior royals from March , losing their Buckingham Palace office and dropping their titles. The couple shocked fans around the world when they announced their intentions last month, and have spent the last few weeks in meetings with their relatives and aides working out their next steps. New details of the agreed arrangement were announced by the Palace yesterday, and former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe said he expects theyaposll be incredible disappointed by the outcome. He told the Sun:  They’d want to keep that Sussex Royal brand name — they haven’t. Without that brand it’s going to be much more dficult for their charitable causes because that was their trademark. “I think they’d want to keep the office at Buckingham Palace as well, which they now don’t have. Harry would also have wanted to have kept using the HRH title but he can’t. He will be incredibly disappointed with that. He also said he thinks it will be dficult for the couple to find a way back in.  After weeks of discussions, the Palace has now announced that the changes will come into effect on March . As this is an unprecedented move for the Royal Family, there will be a review after  months to access how it is working. The Palace spokesman has also confirmed Meghan and Harry will be closing their Buckingham Palace office, after reports that all  of their staff face the axe as the couple prepare to move their lives to North America. The new guidance also says the couple will continue working with their existing patronages and are working to build a new non-profit organisation.

Tipping the scales at st lbs, Lynne Gaskell, , from Lancashire, was determined to lose weight so she “could be around for longer” to look after her autistic son Joshua. After being told she was pre-diabetic during a full health MOT when she turned , Lynne knew it was time to act. She started researching ways to get into shape and put herself forward for the Second Nature programme, a -week programme which focuses on ‘rewiring’ people’s habits to live healthier lives. She said: The results of the blood test showed I was at risk of type  diabetes and they classed me as pre-diabetic. They said the best thing for me to do was to lose weight. “I didn’t want to join a gym or any of the slimming groups as they didn’t appeal to me. “My son Joshua is autistic and needs a lot of care. He was one of the reasons why it was important to become healthier.” After signing up to the digital-focused plan, Lynne was a set of ‘smart’ scales and an activity tracker that links with the app, allowing her to monitor her weight-loss progress and daily step count.  She was also sent a recipe book, a meal plan and daily motivational articles, and was added to an online peer support group - hosted by a qualied dietitian offering daily advice. The digital aspect meant she still had the motivation to shed the pounds without having to stand up in front of a room of strangers and talk about her weight. She said: I lost weight straight away. It’s really easy to stick to and because I’m eating healthily, my husband, Lee, is too - he’s lost two stone.  “The biggest change I’ve made is creating meal plans and sticking to the meals, using their recipes and keeping a food diary.” She swapped fast food for freshly cooked dishes, including a number of delicious treats like chocolate-covered desserts, muffins and curries. She was also told that nothing was off limits, meaning she could treat herself to the odd glass of wine. She said: “I really don’t feel as though I’m missing out on anything - and I’ve cooked things I wouldn’t normally cook. The things we do like eating, we’ve found an alternative way of cooking them, or substituted it with something . “There’s nothing you can’t have as long as you have it in moderation or that you’re very mindful that what you’re having is a treat.  “On a Friday night, my husband and I will sometimes have a bottle of wine with our neighbours or we’ll enjoy a takeaway - I will choose a healthier option though. “I’ve given some of my recipes to my father-in-law, who is diabetic, and my mother-in-law who is at risk - and she’s lost lbs.” Lynne also started walking every day, slowly at first, beginning with , steps, gradually increasing it to , over the duration of the -week programme. Lynne has stopped an incredible st and now weighs st lbs, saying the weightloss has also helped ease the pain of the arthritis she has in her knee. Sheaposs also bought herself a dog, and walking Aubrey gives her a reason to get out exercising over the weekend.  She said: I’ve wanted a dog all my married le, but my husband always used to say that I would never walk it or take care of it. But after I’d lost a couple of stone, he agreed that I could get a puppy. “I have a beautul chocolate labrador called Aubrey - she’s  weeks now and she is taken for walks all the time. Having a dog helps me to get out at the weekend. “My son is overweight too - because of his autism, he has a very restricted diet and we have to stick to very specic things. So it’s been great for us to take the dog out together for a couple of hours. “I’m now much more active with him over the weekends. But le hasn’t hugely changed - which is a good thing. It just means I have the peace of mind of knowing I will be around for a lot longer for Josh - and be healthier around him.  “I’ve just had my yearly check up and the results from my blood tests is perfect - my sugar levels are fine and I’m no longer at risk of type- diabetes. Second Nature was set up by Chris Edson and Mike Gibbs — both former NHS advisors — to tackle Britainaposs obesity and type- diabetes epidemic. The programme, which offers an effective alternative to fasting, calorie counting and points- based diets, has so far amassed , users and is also being trialled by the NHS. Chris Edson, co-founder of Second Nature, said: “We’ve used our research and insights to create an app that helps you rewire your habits.  “Using smart behavioural science, our app makes it easy for you to form new habits, ones that help you sleep better, eat better and feel better. Habits that help you lose weight, and keep it off. “As habit experts, we know the key to changing them successfully is keeping it up, long-term. So, we stay by your side, in your pocket, helping you keep up these positive changes for good. “In the end, you’ll find you’re not trying to lose weight, you’re not depriving yourself or counting calories, you’re just living better, automatically, every day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ms apologises trans shopper after","story":"NewsMS apologises to trans shopper after refusing them access to mens changing roomMarks and Spencer has issued a letter of apology to Myla Corvidae after they were refused access to the menswear changing rooms in the chains Aberdeen storeShareCommentsByCharlotte Penketh-KingMilo Boyd:,  FEB NewsThe shopping chain issued an apology to Myla Corvidae \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

A spokesman for MS admitted aposaposa mistake was madeaposapos and it has apologised - including a personal letter from the manager.

I left the changing room to grab a bigger size in one of the jumpers and a female attendant approached me on the shop floor.

I was utterly shocked and the only thing I could think of to say was aposIaposm not femaleapos to which she looked me up and down, apologised and walked off.  I felt sick, like I was being accused of some kind of crime just for trying on clothes. Afterwards, I went home and cried - I have never been accosted like that in a store before. I had to go back in and speak to someone in store because no one took it seriously the first time and I started crying even trying to talk about it again with them. Myla had been shopping in the Aberdeen City Centre branch of Marks and Spencer regularly for the past five years before the incident.

Myla said: I donapost think the apology was enough to be honest, it shouldnapost have ever happened to start with and I have lost confidence in Marks and Spencer as a company for standing up for trans folk like myself. I still feel scared to shop at Marks and Spencer in case it happens again where orI have to deal with that same person again. The fact that I saw a female using the space at the same time in full view of the attendant when I left the changing rooms just made it so much more of a personal attack. I honestly don’t think I would go back there, I don’t want to have to experience something like that again or see that staff member again. I am still very much upset by what happened and  I were to go back I wouldn’t go on my own and I would not be shopping for clothes there again.

Trikafta. The wonder drug Lorraine believes could save her son’s le. Yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced he has ­accelerated the process to get Trikafta agreed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to treat cystic fibrosis . It’s excellent news for thousands with CF, but has only compounded the agony for Joe’s family. NICE’s planned timelines for assessing the triple combination therapy show they expect to publish their recommendation on December  this year. That will be too late for Joe whose doctors have already begun to talk to his family about starting end-of-le care. So today, Lorraine is making a plea directly to the drug company Vertex to grant her dying son Trikafta now, on compassionate grounds. “Vertex,you have any compassion at all, you won’t let my amazing son die,” Lorraine says. “Help me get Trikafta for Joe… I don’t know what  can help him now.” I first spoke to Lorraine and Joe two years ago in March  when they were fighting for the le-changing drug Orkambi. Joe was  and extremely unwell. Orkambi wasn’t available then on the NHS because of its hefty price tag, and the Barnes family were among those fighting a three-year battle to get Vertex, NHS England and NICE to agree a deal so it could be prescribed in the UK. The Orkambi campaign was ­eventually successful, with the drug finally made available in the UK last October, but campaign group Just Treatment believe up to  people may have died waiting for the row to be resolved.Orkambi helped Joe for a while, but he is now extremely ill again, and all the evidence suggests Trikafta could help. So now his exhausted family are facing another David and Goliath fight for a tiny pill that couldsave their son’s le. Currently, there is no cure for CF and half of people in the UK with it die before they are . The le-limiting condition clogs the lungs with sticky mucus as well as affecting other organs. But in the very few cases in the UK where Trikafta has been made available, they have had almost miraculous results. “Joe is too poorly for a lung ­transplant,” Lorraine says. “He can’t go to school, he gets breathless just going upstairs. He’s suffering with chest pains, coughing up blood, he can’t gain weight, he’s depressed. He’s gone through more in his  years that most people will go through in a letime.” Lorraine says Joe’s doctor is in the process of applying for compassionate Trikafta for her son and seven other patients, but that the ­paperwork is prohibitive. “It took his doctor  hours spread over six weeks to fill in one form,” she says. “If there are eight to apply for that will take  weeks to get through them all and then it’s up to Vertex who gets the drug.” Trikafta campaigners know the drugs are expensive, but say the cost is nothing compared with the cost to the NHS of looking after a child going through end-stage CF. CF accounts for , hospital admissions and over , hospital bed days a year. Treatment can easily take four hours a day including physiotherapy, and patients can be on up to  tablets every day. A spokeswoman for Vertex said: “Triple combination therapy is not yet licensed in the EU, and we are restricted by law in how and to whom we can supply this potential medicine in a compassionate use programme.

Playing the role of the grieving sister, Sabah Khan spun a web of deceit after her sister Saima was found dead in her Luton home, having suffered multiple traumatic injuries, including  stab wounds. Police at first thought it was a burglary gone wrong but soon uncovered the shocking story of a complex love triangle between one husband and two sisters.New documentary series The Lady Killersreveals how Sabah, driven by rage and jealously, looked into multiple methods of how to see to her sister’s death.She googled how to buy poison, venomous snakes and even paid £, for a Witch Doctor to put a spell on her sister. The Khan family lived what many would describe as a classic Islamic le: three generations of the same family living under one roof, caring for and supporting each other. But over a four-year period, right under her sister’s nose, Sabah Khan was having an affair with Saima’s husband, Hafeez Rehman. Former detective Peter Bleksley said: She was infatuated with Hafeez, her sister’s husband. She wanted him to be entirely her own and she would stop of nothing to try and achieve that.  As Jo Sidhu, Sabah’s defence barrister, says in the documentary, Hafeez began exploring his options, and even inquired as to whether marrying his sister-in-law would be permissible in Islam. “He’d even made inquiries with the local Imam at the mosque as to whether he might be able to take Sabah as a second we.He was told that wouldn’t be allowed in Islam to marry two sisters,” he said.With her options wearing thin, Sabah turned to murder.  “She’d searched for venomous snakes and poison, so it was clear that she had looked into how to kill her sister for some time,” author and former Detective Clare Mackintosh revealed. It was online that Sabah came across a Pakistani Witch Doctor, or ‘fixer,’ to see to her sister’s demise for the cost of £,. “There had been texts between Sabah and someone in Pakistan who practiced black magic,” Jo Sidhu added.  “A person she’d appealed to and paid money to put a spell on her sister to bring about her early death.” Having seen her investment fail, Sabah concluded that she herself would have to do the killing.Luring Saima back from work to the family home, Sabah viciously attacked her sister with a kne she’d purchased from a local supermarket, stabbing her  times. Mr Sidhu added: When the police attended, they found a scene of carnage in the hallway "},{"url":null,"title":"mum urged move out home","story":"NewsMum urged to move out of her home after sharing photo of creepy doorA mum shared a photo of her daughters bedroom online but a creepy detail in the picture has people instructing her to move out of there sharpishShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsWould you be creeped out by the door  \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Three-year-old Anggun and -year-old Monti were paired after they were rescued from captivity. They were successfully released into Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in West Borneo this month. Won’t be long before they branch out further into the jungle. Adorable footage shows the orphaned baby orangutan and her foster mum who were paired together for survival by rescuers. Monti, a -year-old female, and three-year-old infant Anggun, were both rescued from human captivity. Monti was found in a village in Ketapang in , and became Anggunaposs foster mother at an International Animal Rescue orangutan centre in the same region after the orphaned baby arrived there in . The duo were encouraged into the rehabilitation sanctuaryaposs aposforest schoolapos so Anggun could re-learn the natural behaviours of climbing, foraging for food and making nests which are essential for survival in the forests. Experts hoped maternal primate Monti, who had already mastered these skills after  years at the centre, would teach Anggun what she knew - with the pair developing an extremely close bond. Karmele L Sanchez, Programme Director of IAR Indonesia, said: It was hoped Monti would teach Anggun the necessary skills to survive in her natural habitat while also protecting and nurturing her.  The strategy was highly successful - Monto became increasingly maternal and Anggun grew more confident at learning new things. This proves that, even when orangutans like Monti lose their mothers at a very young age, they are still able to be good mothers, not just with their own children, but also with other baby orangutans. In the wild, baby orangutans stay with their mothers until aged between six and eight so it is hoped the bonded pair will continue to embrace their new lives in the jungle together.  Animal volunteers travelled for three days to the release point at the heart of the national park - transporting the orangutans over a -mile road trip which was followed by an hour-long boat journey and finally a five and a half mile walk. Three other rehabilitated orangutans from the centre, named Merah, Ujang and Utat, were also released on the same day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailGovernment chiefs in Ibiza and Mallorca are cracking down on boozy Britsapos drunken tourism by limiting the number of drinks holidaymakers in all-inclusive hotels can have per day. In a move which the British Association of Travel Agentshas slammed has blasted as misdirected, the Balearic Government has passed a new law allowing just six drinks a day to be served at all-inclusive hotels. This will affect tourists in Arenal and Magaluf in Mallorca and in the West End of San Antonio in Ibiza. It will apply to any new bookings at all-inclusive hotels from now on, and will limit Brits to three free drinks at lunch and three with their evening meal. Balearic chiefs say they want to improve the image of these three party resorts which have been blighted by bad behaviour, usually caused by too much drink. The new legislation has also introduced big fines for aposbalconingapos - jumping into a swimming pool from a hotel balcony. There will be a ban on pub crawls and drink offers such as happy hours and two for ones, which reports say have been welcomed. But the alcohol limit in all-inclusive hotels has caused controversy. The ABTA is asking the Balearic Government to think again about this element of the campaign. A spokesperson said: The Balearic Islands and the destinations of Magaluf and San Antonio are very popular with British holidaymakers. While we strongly support initiatives that improve the health and safety of holidaymakers, as well as the welfare of local communities, such as encouraging bar owners to take a more responsible approach to the sale of alcohol and campaigning for balcony safety among young holidaymakers, we believe some of the measures announced in relation to addressing unsociable behaviour, for example targeting all-inclusive holidays, are misdirected. The vast majority of holidaymakers on all-inclusives are couples and families, so it is dficult to see how imposing strict rules on this type of arrangement will fix the problem of anti-social behaviour in resort. We would encourage the Balearic authorities to reconsider this.  “It’s also important to highlight that the limits on drinks does not apply to all-inclusive holidays that have already been booked in these resorts.” The six-a-day limit does not apply to any of the all-inclusive hotels outside of Arenal, Magaluf and San Antonio. Hotel owners are said to be worried and claim tourists are already shunning their establishments and opting for those outside the zones so they can enjoy unlimited booze like before. In some cases, they say, the hotels are just yards apart but not within the target zones of Arenal, Magaluf and San Antonio.  The new regulations will be valid for five years, with breaches leading to a penalty-based-system of fines of up to €, and suspension of activity for up to three years. Contracts already signed between tour operators and hoteliers will be respected to prevent any legal or contractual issues. A spokesperson for the Balearic Government said: The Balearic Islands government has approved a Decree Law to combat alcohol excess in certain tourist areas, with the aim of forcing real change in the tourism model of these destinations promoting responsible conduct, adopting measures to protect the destination and avoiding issues derived from excessive alcohol consumption in certain places of the Balearic Islands.

The two women, who now live in London, were forced to keep their relationship a secret in their home country - where under sharia law, same-sex relationships can be punishable by death. Now free to love each other, they gave a moving interview to the Arabic-language TV show aposJaafar Talkapos which airs on the DW channel, during a Valentineaposs Day special. Using aposFadapos and aposNanzapos as aliases, as the segment includes images of the pair in Saudi Arabia, they revealed how they fell in love after meeting on Snapchat. They managed to keep their relationship a secret until Nanz, who says she discovered her sexuality in her early teens, began to attract suspicion from relatives because she kept knocking back potential suitors. The couple left Saudi Arabia when travel restrictions for women were lted in August  and were granted asylum in the UK. During the interview they opened up about what it is like to be dferent in a country where, according to Saudi Arabiaaposs security agency, homosexual relations can be punishable by death.  When they finally did open up about their relationship on social media upon reaching safety, Nanzaposs relatives promptly cut off all ties with her.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA major retailer has been ordered to pay a store manager £,  [€,] after unfairly dismissing him for hugging other staff members. Workplace Relations Commission adjudication officer Patsy Doyle said the man was wronged by his employer and failings in the disciplinary process caused him inordinate reputational damage. The store manager stated he told his employer that while he had hugged staff, no one had taken serious offence and it was “banter in the workplace”. Ms Doyle also ordered the employer to pay an additional €,over not paying the man’s notice. Doyle stated that the €, compensation be paid in respect of the procedural unfairness and lapse in natural justice afforded to the store manager. The man was dismissed from his post at the end of November  and the dismissal letter told him that “I find your actions have fell below the expected standards we require from a member of management when colleagues have told you to stop hugging them, but you continued to do so”. The letter went on: “As a member of the management team, I find your actions are wholly unacceptable and has resulted in colleagues being offended. The company launched a probe into the store manager’s behaviour after a female member of staff alleged other staff had told her they felt uncomfortable with his aposinappropriateapos behaviour, which included unwanted physical touching. The store manager stated that he had not had a complaint against him in his seven years at the company. The store manager appealed the dismissal internally. He stated that “hugging was a universal practice, not just to females and should be viewed as a minor misconduct and not gross misconduct”. He saidhe had been directed to stop he would have. He argued his dismissal was not warranted and the sanction disproportionate. On March  last year, the manager was informed the decision to dismiss had been upheld. He secured alternative work last April. The retailer told the WRC the store manager’s actions in the case “amounted to breach of trust between the parties in the employment relationship”.  The retailer stated: “This served as an unacceptable departure from the staff handbook on the core value of ‘respect each other’ and amounted to serious misconduct warranting summary dismissal.” The retailer’s appeal manager in the case stated that no complaint of harassment had arisen but four to five staff out of a total of - had been negatively impacted by his actions. Under cross-examination at the WRC hearing, the store manager confirmed he had pinched a female member of staff and argued that his behaviour amounted to horse play. The store manager told the WRC hearing that hugging “was a widespread practice at the shop and was not reserved for females”. Doyle stated that no apparent action was taken to probe or curtail the store manager’s “very unusual behaviour. I have made no finding on the complainant’s guilt or innocence in that regard”.

win on their way to the Championship title in  thanks to a Ryan Conroy penalty – stretching back over the last decade.However, even from the last meeting in September, there could be considerable changes to the way James McPake sets his side out as he plots a way to double that win rate.The clash on a Friday night on TV saw Jordan McGhee net his first goal for the Dark Blues with a fine header after Queens striker Jack Hamilton had beaten his namesake in the Dundee goal early on.That was a disappointing night for the Dens gaffer as his side struggled to find their feet in the Championship.And he’ll be hoping this version of the Dark Blues can show there’s been some good work done in the time since.After another poor spell at the start of the year, Dundee have put together two positive displays to earn a point at Mortonand win convincingly at home to Partick Thistle last time out.Should boss James decide to stick with the same line-up and -- formation, there will only be four names remaining on the team sheet from the autumn.Of the team that saw off the Jags last time out, only Jordon Forster, Declan McDaid, Graham Dorrans and Kane Hemmings featured in the last trip down to Dumfries.McGhee grabbed the goal that day but he and Cammy Kerr are both recovering from surgery and Saturday may come too soon for them.And with the three-man defence working so well with Christophe Berra added in against Thistle, the Dens gaffer might be tempted to stick rather than twist.That’s likely to see Josh Meekings retain his place also with McDaid filling in at left wing-back and Christie Elliott on the right.Of the midfield three, Dorrans is a stick-on to start, barring any injury problems, while Shaun Byrne has been impressing in training in recent weeks and showed up well against the Jags.The big decision for James is who to put in the place of Ross Callachan.The on-loan midfielder had injected dynamism to the middle of the park and was unlike anything  in the squad.That could see Paul McGowan drop back to a deeper role after stepping in as a makesht striker last week.And Callachan’s energy could be replaced by fit-again Andrew Nelson after he ed from surgery to his hand for the closing stages last time out.Another certainty, barring injury, is Kane Hemmings as he targets moving his goal tally into double figures for the season. vw, px\"  The Doonhamers will have a dferent look about them as well with three key players having left in the winter window.On-loan goalie Robby McCrorie was recalled by Rangers to then send him out to Livingston and that saw the Lions send Ross Stewart Queens way.| https:t.co htWpFhTvHmdash Queen of the SouthJanuary , Centre-back Darren Brownlie made the switch to Partick while creator Faissal El Bakhtaoui headed off to Morocco.Dundee’s recent record on astroturf makes pleasant reading.They are unbeaten in the last five on the surface, winning three times – -

in front.Anthony DeLuca did win a penalty shot in the th minute but his effort went wide of the target.Troncinsky pulled one back for the Yorkshire outfit to reduce the deficit to - inside the final two minutes but that would be the final score.With a win in their only game of the weekend, the Stars now have a week to prepare for their next game against their arch enemies Fe Flyers at the Dundee Ice Arena next Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50548323-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50548323-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50548323-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.50548323-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"large high street optician touted for historic dundee fashion store","story":"A chain of high street opticians is being touted as the future occupant of a Dundee suburb#s retailer#s unit after it unveiled plans to move where.Millars of Broughty Ferry is set to leave its Gray Street unit and move into a smaller shop nearby.Shop bosses say they are #struggling# with online competition and will downsize in order to cut costs.A planning application submitted on behalf of the retailer by Building Design Services of Arbroath proposes iding the unit into a ground floor retail unit and two first-floor offices.In a letter to Dundee City Council, architect Gianni Giacomini says a new tenant for the large shop unit is already lined up.#The plan is to move the gentleman’s outfitters into one of the smaller stores and reduce overheads,# he wrote.#There is a large high street optician who shall be taking the ground floor.#It is unclear which optician is interested in the building.

She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The castle#s pointed towers were constructed in the s.The landscapes captured are remarkable for the open vistas, with neither Sitka spruce, jungle of scrub nor any motor vehicles to be seen."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 8 putting along nicely","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more news about Bob#s progress and golfing adventures and chat.This week we have a contribution from The Oban Times Deputy Editor Martin Laing about the Fightmaster CupThe team also discuss the longest putt on record , Golf statistics and find out what Golf Balls are made of.Our #listener# also asks a searching question of Keith and George.Play or download the episode in the link below "},{"url":null,"title":"whisky galore closes the a83","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFurnace villagers thought it was their chance for a starring role in a remake of the  film Whisky Galore!, as a lorry transporting more than  barrels of whisky overturned on the A.The incident, which took place at around pm on Thursday February , saw the road closed just south of Furnace for nine hours and ersions put in place.On Twitter, Transport Scotland confirmed that #specialist recovery equipment [was] required to clear the road# and alternative routes should be used.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"acha holds annual tenants and members conference","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArgyll Community Housing Associationheld its annual tenants and members conference in Inveraray.Themes covered at the conference focused on three areas # involving young people, improving performance and investing in your home.The session on involving young people included presentations from Iona MacDonald and Hannah Nicolson, trainees with ACHA and Argyll and Bute Council respectively.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"kidney-research-uk-takes-another-tour-o-borders","story":"BORDERS cycling event company, Hillside Outside, have announced that they will be partnering with

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told.

First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe.

What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age.

In the first, a Panorama investigation, Amazon: What They Know About Us, the tech titan and his company were judged by some observers to be data vultures feeding off customersrsquo information, their activities posing a threat to democracy and freedom. One retailer, who alleged his small business was ruined after getting involved with Amazon, even compared the firm to the devil. We saw also a high street bookseller, in tears, locking up her shop for the last time. She could not compete on prices and speed of delivery, so the shop had to close.But then there was the other Jeff Bezos, the one who gave  billionof his fortune to the fight against climate change. If you have a good idea about how to save this spinning rock from rising temperatures, the Bezos Earth Fund wants to hear about it.ldquoClimate change is the biggest threat to our planet, the entrepreneur wrote in an Instagram post.: Before you click think of the damage you are doingldquoThis global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs ndash any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth.

Just when you were wondering what you had in common with someone worth  billion, along comes the answer.So which one is the real Jeff Bezos, a superhero out to save the planet with dollars instead of special powers, or the Jeff Bezos whose company is deemed a threat to democracy and freedom Questioning the motives of those extremely wealthy iniduals who give to charity has become commonplace. While praising Andrew Carnegie for giving fortunes away to help and educate others, we nevertheless remember that he made his money through the blood and sweat of workers, as did every capitalist of his age. Many are the universities who have accepted legacies, only to be taken to task generations later by students questioning the morality of how the money was made.In Bezosrsquos case, customers have come to look anew at Amazon, and the rest of the big tech companies, and wonder what has been invented on our watch.: Licence fee outdatedYet in most cases the customer willingly gave over the information they now deem so precious. Who put all those personal details into Facebook  Who has ever read the terms and conditions or privacy policy  How many of us have bought an Alexa smart speaker and speak to it more often than we do aged relatives or other members of the family Alexa is a perfect example of our love suspect relationship with technology and, by extension, those who have made vast fortunes from it. In January it was reported that sales of Alexa-enabled devices had passed the  million mark. Though Amazon did not break the total down into its speakers and other products, the extent of the tech revolution that has taken place in our homes is breathtaking.I remember when smart speakers first appeared. There was no end to what you could ask Alexa to do, from order dog food to play your favourite music and find out what the time and temperature was anywhere in the world.How clever we thought we were, how much time we could save. Then the whispers and doubts began. Sure enough, it wasnrsquot just the machines listening. Humans were doing it as well.Big tech said only a tiny fraction of conversations were monitored, and that it was only done to improve the service, but customers were unnerved and rightly so.: Amazon target site for wind farm plansThe biggest joke of all was that people had paid for the devices they now accused of infringing their privacy. One former Amazon executive interviewed by Panorama said he still had Alexas in his home but he turned them offhe wanted to have a private conversation. I expect after watching the programme that many more will do the same.There is a backlash building against Big Tech, with the race on to see how governments can tax and regulate them better.If one was cynical, Mr Bezosrsquos setting up of a  billion fund, like Mark Zuckerbergrsquos call this week for greater regulation, can be seen as the tech titans once again trying to stay ahead of the curve.Doing good things, saying the right things, to reframe the debate in their favour tinkering at the edges when what they really should be doing is paying more tax, assuming greater responsibility for their actions, and reducing their own carbon footprint. Anyway, how much dference can  billion make given the size of the problem faced The Amazon chief executive is not the only fantastically rich person having his actions questioned. Mike Bloomberg, whose charitable giving down the years makes the odd billion here and there look positively peanut-sized, is feeling the heat too, with a rival for the Democratic nomination, Elizabeth Warren, calling him an ldquoegomaniac billionaire and saying it was a ldquoshame he was able to ldquobuy his way into the debate.It is right to be cautious about where vast wealth comes from and what it is used for, but at the same time we should give credit where it is due.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip.

Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

He also asked for an update on the progress of current candidate mast locations in Burray, Hoy and Stromness.In response, Paul Wheelhouse, minister for connectivity and the islands, stated that no new proposed mast locations have been introduced since April  and — despite regular engagement with mobile operators — no operator has committed to using any of the candidate mast locations.Last July, Mr McArthur wrote to mobile phone operators urging them to engage constructively with the programme in Orkney.The MSP said: “It is disappointing to see that progress in closing gaps in mobile phone coverage across Orkney appears to have stalled.“While the Minister has provided assurances that discussions with mobile phone companies are ongoing, there is no sign they are prepared to engage seriously.  Sites have been identied in Stromness, Hoy and Burray, yet people and businesses in these communities are missing out on the better mobile coverage that should be available.“Meantime, efforts to identy new sites appear to have come to a complete halt. That is not good enough.“Ministers and mobile phone operators clearly agreed that public money was needed to plug existing gaps in the network. Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground. As a result, we now have a G Infill Programme that is doing next to no infilling.“I will be urging Ministers to investigate why so little progress has been made and reiterating the need to get the programme back on track”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility.

Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"adrian chiles takes the helm for a sail around co down coast on bbc","story":"Adrian Chiles visiting Belfast Harbour for BBC Two series Our Coast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAdrian Chiles visiting Belfast Harbour for BBC Two series Our CoastDavid O#DornanFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPresenter Adrian Chiles will be seen helping to steer a boat into Belfast Harbour and getting behind the controls of a crane in the docks on network television tonight.The BBC Two programme Our Coast has an entire episode dedicated to exploring Co Down#s shores from Belfast Lough down to Strangford Lough via the Ards Peninsula.The journey starts with Adrian highlighting the work of Belfast#s harbour pilots - a team of five captains with  years of seafaring experience between them - who dock huge vessels safely on a daily basis.Adrian tells viewers: Mammoth ships still come in and out of Belfast every day.

But I#m not sureI#ll have to sell my house and go back to Poland.I made Northern Ireland my home because I love an Ulster fry. I think Polish people have the same sense of humour, we like the craic, good food and family and we assimilate very well.But will it be my home for the next - years, can the Government guarantee that  I feel like a local person hereShe said the new rules could force dficult choices on families, such as with her sister who currently lives with their mother in Poland.If something were to happen, my sister might like to come and live here with me, she said.So, how will that work  She#s a teacher at the university and is really qualied, but will she be able to come here She said the suggested new points system, similar to Canada or Australia, will exclude too many.I have family in Canada but it would be impossible for me to move there under their system, even though I#m qualied and have experience.A disgrace: Hospitality Ulster#s Colin Neill Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHospitality Ulster chief Colin Neill PA Media FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHospitality Ulster chief Colin Neill Hospitality Ulster said the proposals would simply decimate the hospitality sector.Those classied as unskilled and those earning below £, will no longer be allowed to work here, Mr Neill explained.Employees with soft skillsare a vital element of the success of the Northern Ireland hospitality and tourism offer. However, they have been ignored.There has been failure to take into consideration the unique set of circumstances hereWhat sort of message does that send out to the world  How many hospitality businesses will now not be able to fill vacancies right across the sector ”“There has been failure to take into consideration the unique set of circumstances here complete ignorance of the importance of our sector in particular and demonstrates absolute contempt for our position.”He added: This is not about cheap labour, our industry has over , job vacancies to fill by  and we need , chefs, with a declining birth rate and near full employment in Northern Ireland, these proposals will damage our economy and limit plans to grow the tourism economy to a £bn industry.“This is nothing short of a disgrace and we are calling on our First and deputy First Minister to intervene immediately to make direct representations to the Home Office and the Prime Minister on the exceptional circumstances the sector is now faced with.”Locals don#t want the jobs: Jerome Mullen, honorary Polish consul for NIExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJerome Mullen, the Honorary Consul of Poland in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJerome Mullen, the Honorary Consul of Poland in Northern IrelandHe said many of the , Polish people living here were skilled workers.I actually had a local company on the phone recently, asking for  qualied electricians from Poland, he added.They would have no problem meeting the threshold because the pay for such a skilled job would exceed £,.Not even the best hotels in Belfast would pay anything like the thresholdBut that doesn#t apply across the board, especially into the lower-skilled areas, of which there#s quite a substantial amount in hotels.Hotels are struggling right across the board to get people in the kitchen and to get cleaning and waiting staff.Not even the best hotels in Belfast would pay anything like the threshold that is being talked about. This is going to really be quite dficult. The Government seems to be saying to the industry to give the jobs to the local population, but the local population don#t want to work for those wages. Risk to £bn industry: NI Retail Consortium#s Aodhan ConnollyExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAodhan Connolly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAodhan ConnollyHe said said a move to a £, salary threshold was still not low enough.“To put that in context, £, is higher than the starting salary for many architects and solicitors in Northern Ireland, he said.In retail about % of our warehouse and logistics staff and % of our front of house colleagues are EU nationals. But in our supply chain some farms and factories have up to % of processing and production staff who are EU nationals. It provides great barriers for our industry and our supply chainFilling these jobs is not just important for the NI economy but to provide the £billion of NI Agri-food that retailers buy for the Great British market.”He added: While we realise that the points system will take into account job offer, English language, salary, shortage and educational qualications, it still provides great barriers for our industry and our supply chain. This new plan from the government still leaves us great concerns for our future staffing levels and competitiveness in the global marketplace, as well a providing the same level of service and value that customers have come to expect.There are benefits: Economist Dr Esmond BirnieExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEsmond BirnieNigel McDowell Ulster University FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEsmond BirnieThe economist Esmond Birnie said the plans were an opportunity to develop the local workforce.It#s not going to be easy, but we#re going to be driven back to developing the existing labour force, including the people who are economically inactive, he said.This is a challenging situation, but it has to be part of the process of transforming Northern Ireland economyThat#s a very large number - far more than those seeking unemployment benefit. That unused stock of labourto wither on the vine.I think this is a challenging situation, but it has to be part of the process of the Northern Ireland economy being transformed to one where there are higher skills, higher wages and higher productivity.Mr Birnie said most EU nationals living here would have the option to stay, with settled or pre-settled status.That#s a good thing from their point of view and for stabilising the economy, he added.Balance not right: Brexit supporter Irwin ArmstrongExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseIrwin ArmstrongKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIrwin ArmstrongIrwin Armstrong, the chief executive of Ballymena#s CIGA Healthcare and a supporter of Brexit, said introducing the plans in Northern Ireland would be crazy.

I always thought there should be three tests - do you have a job, do you speak reasonable English and have you a clean criminal record If you answer yes to all, you#re welcome.

Once I started, I just couldn#t stop.The le of a pigeon fancier gets even more demanding when racing season starts.When spring arrives it#ll be races nearly every weekend, Keelie said.On Friday nights I#ll be at the club getting the birds ready to go wherever the race is from. Then on Saturday, all day, I#ll be glued to the skies watching for them to come back.I#ve had a few friends come around to see the lofts and I know a lot of them think it#s all a bit strange, but it#s not to me.This has brought the family so close together. My grandad has taught me and my dad everything we know and I#m so happy to spend the time with him around the lofts.There is a bit of in-family rivalry though, with all three members willing their birds to be the first to arrive home.Whoever loses has to make the tea, said Keelie, who will soon have to fit her pigeon routine in around exam revision for her studies at St Ronan#s College in Lurgan.Keelie#s navigations through the highs and lows of the  season will be featured on CBBC on Tuesday, February  .She narrates My Le: My Pigeons and Me, which reveals how her unlikely hobby has strengthened the family bond and allows them to spend many hours together as they look after their birds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKeelie and Aaryan at a pigeon show in Blackpool FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKeelie and Aaryan at a pigeon show in BlackpoolShe even hands out tips to another young fancier, Aaryanfrom Rochdale.My grandad has been doing this for over  years now.

Just a fthof those aged  or over admitted to have done so in the last  monthsThere was a swell of support for mph zones to be introduced, particularly in areas frequented by children and young families, with the majority of respondentssaying they thought the lower speed limit should be more widely used. Approximately four-fthsfelt a mph speed limit should be applied outside schools - a rise of % from the previous year - and three-quartersthought it should be used where children play.The replies to the survey suggest that yesterday#s announcement from Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon that she is currently trialling a scheme concerning whether mph signs will be welcomed.The minister said: I believe that reducing the maximum speed traffic can travel at on some of our roads, particularly those near schools, can help.My department is committed to introducing measures that reduce the speed of traffic on our roads. We are currently trialling an arrangement of signs that is intended to allow the introduction of more part-time mph limits at schools. We are also trialling the effectiveness of #signed only# mph limits.These would be more economical, and could be used more widely in appropriate environments, such as residential areas with schools, than would be possible with the current approach of providing mph limits along with traffic-calming features. I fully intend to see what potential there is from these trials, to build on the work already under way.Less than half those surveyedthought mph zones should be introduced to residential streets and even lessin areas frequented by cyclists.Over two-fths of all driversreported they normally exceeded the speed limit on motorways and almost a quarter of all driversadmitted to normally speeding on dual carriageways - lower than the % and % reported for this in   and   respectively.Those admitting to speeding dropped to % for roads in a rural area and % in an urban areas.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_f-acd-e--fdcedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_f-acd-e--fdcedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_f-acd-e--fdcedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_f-acd-e--fdcedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_f-acd-e--fdcedc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Irelandexclusive, Northern Ireland motorists caught using mobile phone in three yearsAlmost , motorists were caught using a mobile phone while at the wheel in Northern Ireland in a three-year period.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadFamilies #plunged into sadness,# says MLA after two die in horror Ballymena crashFinucane family #in the dark# over Belfast bomb bid motiveEx-Wrightbus director lashes out at #hurtful# claims donations to his church drove collapse#IRA# graffiti targeting UUP councillor appears in Co Down Pals# grief as Co Antrim crash claims two young lives,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Because of his record of delivering results the next generation won’t have to stand in airports waving off their parents.”Fianna Fail’s Norma Foley nominated party leader Mr Martin for taoiseach.She said: “In a letime distinguished by public service, Micheal Martin has always remained true to himself, his people and his roots.“His belief in the duty of politics to serve all sections of our society have defined his time in office. If you look fairly at his record you will see that he has already achieved far more positive change than any of his critics could ever hope to match.”Seconding the nomination, party colleague James O’Connor, the youngest TD in the Dail, said that Mr Martin has led progressive policies.“Many of the reforms which he has implemented have been absolutely central in opening educational opportunities for people from all parts of our society,” he added.“Micheal Martin is known for his perseverance and for wanting to achieve change. If you look at the substance of his political achievements you will see a record of which many of us here would be proud of.”Nobody  in the Dail can lead the government of change that the country voted for apart from Mary Lou McDonaldPearse Doherty, Sinn Fein TDProposing Ms McDonald, Sinn Fein TD Pearse Doherty said the fact she would become the first female taoiseach “is something that would deliver change”.“Nobody  in the Dail can lead the government of change that the country voted for apart from Mary Lou McDonald.“She has all of the qualities that a leader needs. She has shown that she is willing to reach out to other parties and engage in discussions.“She is the vision that the country needs and when I say country, I mean all  counties.”Seconding Ms McDonald for taoiseach, Sinn Fein TD Claire Kerrane said: “As a Republican woman, there is no one I admire more than Mary Lou McDonald. We need change, we need something new, we need Mary Lou.”Sometimes real leadership emerges not when there is a big shiny prize to be won but when the going is really tough, and when there is no thanks or plaudits to be hadJoe O#Brien, the Green PartyThe Green Party leader was nominated by party colleague Joe O’Brien.Mr O’Brien said it is essential that the next government takes real action on climate change and to implement policies to clean the air, get better public transport and to build energy-efficient homes.He said the Green Party is not about personality politics and that Mr Ryan had doubled the amount of TDs to  in the new Dail during his leadership.“Sometimes real leadership emerges not when there is a big shiny prize to be won but when the going is really tough, and when there is no thanks or plaudits to be had,” he added.PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadMcDonald leads the way, but no Taoiseach elected in first sitting of new DailSinn Fein TD Reada Cronin to avoid disciplinary action over Israel postsFears leaked Garda file could lead to escalation of Drogheda gang feud Mary Lou McDonald among four party leaders nominated for TaoiseachWelcome to Drum - the only Protestant village in Republic of Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Then he becomes your partner. I have said, the first thing to be is honest with yourself... As I walked out the door to my freedom, I knewI didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.” Nelson MandelaThirty years ago, Nelson Mandela stepped out the front gate of the Victor Verster Prison in the suburb of Paarl, near Cape Town.As he and then-we Winnie raised their fists in triumph, he began his long walk to freedom through the mid-afternoon sun. Last week marked  years since Mandela’s release after  years in prison. It is one of history’s most iconic moments and arose from an unlikely exchange the previous evening between the ANC leader and South African President FW de Klerk.When de Klerk announced that he was to be released the following day, Mandela took exception and asked for a week’s notice, saying it was much too soon. The South African president was taken aback, but after consultation with his advisers, he reaffirmed that February ,  would be Madiba’s release date.The lting of a ban on the African National Congress , the Pan African Congressand the South African Communist Party along with  other illegal organisations paved the way for what would be a momentous occasion.Alongside the announcement was the proposed release of political prisoners incarcerated for non- violent activities. Mandela would walk free.He described it in his autobiography, The Long Walk to Freedom, saying that: “...in one sweeping action, he had virtually normalised the situation in South Africa.”One of Derry’s most famous sons, Poet Laureate Seamus Heaney, was deeply influenced by the work of Nelson Mandela and, in particular, his release from prison. Madiba’s release came amid a wave of regime change across Europe and Heaney recalled the era in a  interview with Shaun Johnson for The Independent.He said: “The crisis in South Africa, and the miraculum, as I call it – the wondrous change and wondrous intervention of Nelson Mandela – that was a magical moment in the th century.“In , I remember watching as one regime after the other gently came down in Eastern Europe. And the following February, Mandela came out of prison and it was a memory-marking moment for anybody. The world was entranced with South Africa.A fiercely anti-apartheid Seamus Heaney was at Hard University at the time of Mandela’s release and was translating Philoctetes, a play by Sophocles.The concept of having a moral high ground was at its centre and, while working on it, Heaney found himself relating its content to the political liberation reverberating at the turn of the decade.That ‘memory-marking moment’ inspired him to include a chorus of his own in his adaptation The Cure at Troy:“History says, Dont hopeOn this side of the grave,But then, once in a letimeThe longed-for tidal waveOf justice can rise upAnd hope and history rhyme.”Heaney explained his reasoning to Shaun Johnson in , saying: “The play is really about someone who has been wounded and betrayed, and whether he can reintegrate with the betrayers or not. It seemed to me to mesh beautully with Mandelas .”Brian McCormick, manager of the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in the poet’s Co Derry hometown of Bellaghy, explains further. googletag.cmd.push “It was Mandela’s release that prompted him to write that poem, but it has also been used very much in conjunction with what has happened here in the last  years, in relation to the peace process, he said.The final line had its resonance magnied in  when US President Bill Clinton quoted it on his famous visit to Northern Ireland.It was also quoted as recently as a few weeks ago by Democrat Joe Biden as he began campaigning for the US election. Brian believes the piece has real signicance.He said: “That piece has almost taken on a le of its own. Every time someone hears those words, theyrealise the power of them.“Everybody remembers that moment when Bill Clinton quoted those words back about hope and history rhyming and it shows me the universal nature of his words and his poetry.”“Mandela’s story was so inspiration and powerful, and the fact that, after his release, he went on to facilitate the reinvigoration of South Africa makes him such a leading force of reconciliation.“That story provided a bit of the impetus for politicians here and that’s why those words resonated so much.”The two men’s paths never crossed, but Brian is in no doubt that Mandela would have been aware of Heaney and his work. The South African leader was awarded the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience award in .The award was named after Heaney’s poem The Republic of Conscience and the Nobel Literature Laureate said at the time: “To have the man who made themrhyme accept the Award inspired by my poem is something  again.”In his autobiography, Mandela describes a nagging feeling that permeated the widespread joy of his release.He wrote: “Although I was pleased to have such a reception, I was greatly vexed by the fact that I did not have a chance to say goodbye to the prison staff.”Amid the fanfare and delirium of his release, his regret was not getting a chance to speak to and thank his captors. That level of dignity, humility and forgiveness is something that will never lose its worth.The sentiment embodied by Nelson Mandela and expressed by Seamus Heaney in The Cure at Troy is as relevant today as it was  years ago.Hope, reconciliation and humility, with the latter expressed beautully in the poem whose name adorns the award given to Mandela in .“You carried what you had to and very soon your symptoms of creeping privilege disappeared.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its such a wonderful cause and Lucy really opened my eyes to it.I was nervous when it came to getting it cut, but she couldnt wait and she was all smiles.I took some photos of her getting it done and didnt realise until after that shes winking in one of them.Lucy raised pound through an online sponsorship and the rest was donated by family and friends.Its a great charity and its lovely that Lucy will be helping other children, continued Ms Cruickshank.Its nice to raise awareness that the charity is out there and maybe other girls will want to do the same thing.Id also like to thank Selena Doherty McFeely, of Syenna Hair and Beauty in Pump Street, where she got it cut and Dearbhla Lynch, the hairdresser who cut it for her. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An answer provided in response to a question submitted by SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan to the Minister for Communities detailed the number of empty homes in each constituency. Information on the number of empty homes is held by the Department of Finance’s Land and Property Services. The most recent figures as at September , , indicate a total of , empty residential properties across NI. In Derry City and Strabane there are ,. Empty homes are spread throughout the city, including Wapping Lane close to the Fountain where a row of terraced houses have remained vacant for a considerable period time. The homes sit right next to the iconic Sinclair shirt factory building which was converted into  apartments in recent years. googletag.cmd.push The Northern Ireland Empty Homes Strategy and Action Plan - aimed to tackled the issue of empty homes. The strategy defined an empty home as any residential property not currently occupied that has remained unoccupied for longer than six months, and that is not currently being actively marketed by the owner. It says that vacant homes can blight neighbourhoods, lead to property deterioration, anti-social behaviour and are ultimately a “wasted resource”.  Additionally, identying the whereabouts of owners of empty houses should increase rates revenue. “Although legal penalties such as Empty Dwelling Management Ordershave been used successfully across the water, it is generally accepted that an incentivised ‘carrot’ approach is likely to have a more effective outcome than a purely ‘stick’ orientated strategy,” the report adds. googletag.cmd.push As of December  there were over , people on the housing waiting list with approximately half of these applicants in housing stress. Bringing long-term empty homes back into use would address some of the unmet need It would also encourage wider community regeneration whilst promoting urban renewal, and long-term sustainable rural communities. Work to date has shown that efforts to bring empty homes back into use are hampered by a number of factors not least an absence of staff and financial resources. Other factors include an absence of accurate data about the location and ownership of empty homes and no straightforward legal means of bringing the properties into use, for example to secure the property for rental purposes. NIHE The Housing Executiveran an Empty Homes Unit as part of the strategy, however, it was scaled back before it ceased altogether in March . In a statement to the Derry News, the Department for Communities said: “The Empty Homes Strategy - has undergone an internal review and the Department is currently exploring how the findings will help inform future policy interventions on bringing empty homes back into use. “Future policy interventions to bring more empty homes back into use is something that the department is currently considering. Housing, including bringing homes back into use is a priority for the Minister going forward.” The Empty Homes Strategy was implemented over the period  - during which time awareness was raised through information leaflets. In addition, the now defunct Empty Homes Unit was established to enable members of the public to report empty homes in their area and funding was made available to housing associations to bring empty homes back into use. The Housing Executive used its vesting powers to acquire and demolish an empty tower block in Rathcoole which was replaced with  new social homes by Helm Housing Association and legislation has been amended to allow the sharing of information between the Department, Housing Executive and Land and Property Services. The total number of empty homes brought back into use as a result of the strategy to date is . The information is not currently available by constituency.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Items donated to the charity are sold in the shop and the money raised is used to help local families. Kindness of Strangers is also looking to open a shop in Strabane. A man yesterday called in to speak to the charitys volunteers at the Derry shop. Writing on their Facebook page, a spokesperson for Kindness of Strangers said: A kind stranger called Connor came into our office and handed us a blank cheque. googletag.cmd.push The kind stranger said he lives in Strabane and that he is delighted to hear that we are going to open up a new Kindness of Strangers shop there. Connor said he would like us to identy any shortfall we have in our setting up costs and add a few activities for local children. Connor told us to go ‘all out’ and ‘not to be shy’ when writing out his cheque. So we have decided to organise the biggest, the most fabulous, the most incredible Family Fun Day for children and families in Strabane.

That’s what we bring and then we write our own songs along with that.” The mixture of traditional and contemporary is a big hit in modern Irish music, and fiddle player, Barry Kiernan, credits the resurgence of the Fleadh and, in particular, Fleadh TV, for the upsurge: “So many people go to the Fleadh for dferent reasons. Players come for sessions, others come for concerts. It’s a real spectacle and facilitates musicians of all levels – a phenomenal event. “Fleadh TV brought it into people’s homes and that would have influenced kids in competitions. It was our TV debut too, which was great!” The chemistry between the musicians is palpable and is something that Brendan says grew organically as the lads started playing together. He says: “I’ve been in dferent bands where it’s been like ‘no, this isn’t working, but we’ll get through it’ but we felt it was genuinely greater than the sum of its parts.” Saturday’s crowd can look forward to a band who are totally at ease with themselves, enjoying what they do and bringing their audience along on the journey. “The show has a bit of an arc,” says Stephen. “There’s a lot of light and shade in it, there’s a lot of light and shade. It’s dferent every time and it’s exciting.” Kern will play the Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this Saturday, February  at :pm and the event is BYOB. Tickets are £ and available from the centre –    - or online at www.roevalleyarts.

Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Feb   addthis, Louth-based band Kern are itching to add a Derry venue to their CV as they prepare to play the Twilight Music Sessions at Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this weekend.“The list of counties we haven’t played in is getting smaller,” says Brendan McCreanor, who plays uilleann pipes. “We’ve heard great things about the venue and we’re really looking forward to it.” The band take their name from the Irish word ‘caithearn’ - a medieval Irish soldier, but Brendan says they were attracted to the word’s ‘malleability’. He says: “It means lots of things in lots of languages. The nicest one we came across was in German, where it means a core or a seed. “That’s one of the nicer ones, as there’s a core group here of only three of us and the seed grows and keeps changing.” googletag.cmd.push The band has toured extensively over the past year and list winning the  TradFest Temple Bar showcase and performing at America’s largest Irish festival – the Milwaukee Irish Fest – among their achievements, but lead singer and guitarist Stephen McArdle insists their focus has been on the music rather than the accolades. He says: “They do a showcase in conjunction with Milauwakee Irish Fest and we showcased at it last year. It went out on RTEacute radio. We didn’t really think about winning it, we took it because it was a good gig.  The band’s sound is a fusion of the traditional and the original, with their repertoire intrinsically linked to their native County Louth, something Stephen says is vital to the group’s sound: googletag.cmd.push “When we do traditional music, it tends to have a strong ceangalwith the land we’re coming from. That’s what we bring and then we write our own songs along with that.” The mixture of traditional and contemporary is a big hit in modern Irish music, and fiddle player, Barry Kiernan, credits the resurgence of the Fleadh and, in particular, Fleadh TV, for the upsurge: “So many people go to the Fleadh for dferent reasons. Players come for sessions, others come for concerts. It’s a real spectacle and facilitates musicians of all levels – a phenomenal event. “Fleadh TV brought it into people’s homes and that would have influenced kids in competitions. It was our TV debut too, which was great!” The chemistry between the musicians is palpable and is something that Brendan says grew organically as the lads started playing together. He says: “I’ve been in dferent bands where it’s been like ‘no, this isn’t working, but we’ll get through it’ but we felt it was genuinely greater than the sum of its parts.” Saturday’s crowd can look forward to a band who are totally at ease with themselves, enjoying what they do and bringing their audience along on the journey. “The show has a bit of an arc,” says Stephen. “There’s a lot of light and shade in it, there’s a lot of light and shade. It’s dferent every time and it’s exciting.” Kern will play the Roe Valley Arts  Cultural Centre this Saturday, February  at :pm and the event is BYOB. Tickets are pound and available from the centre –    - or online at www.roevalleyarts. Kern’s latest single, The Porcupine, and album The Left and the Leaning are available now.

For McEleney though, it is just another game.“I think Im at that point in my le and career where, I wouldnt say I dont get nervous, and butterflies are good, but Im kind of used to it now at this stage,” he explained.“You just go out and do the best you can. Obviously its against Derry and I played with them for five years so I still have a soft spot in my heart for them, but I wont have a soft spot on Friday night because there wont be one for me. Ill be looking forward to it and relishing it.”Harps go into the game on the back of a - win against Sligo Rovers in their opening game, and despite the pitch being labelled as crap by Liam Buckley afterwards, and despite the torrential conditions, McEleney believes the three points went to the right team. “It was one of those wins where you get three points up on the board quickly and you get confidence from it,” he stated.“The boys are delighted. We all gave a good account of ourselves. It was a bad night and the pitch wasnt great but we stuck at it and I think overall in the  minutes we created the better chances in the game. It was a pleasing performance and were off to a good start so were happy enough.”For too long Harps have been in a battle to retain their Premier Division status, and again last season, just did enough to beat the drop by beating Drogheda in the end of season play-off. A number of new signings have given rise to the hope that Harps will do much better this time around, a feeling which was reinforced by last weeks win. McEleney believes it is too early to make judgements.“The thing is we know what its going to take,” he explained. “Every game is going to be a tough game. I think its a tougher league than it was last year. Weve had a decent pre-season. I know results in pre-season dont really mean much but we got a good amount of fitness from it and I think that showed the other night because I think we looked fitter than them over the whole  minutes. Hopefully we can stay a couple of pegs above it, but its going to be tough.“By no means are we saying Were definitely staying up and this, that and the other. Id be lyingI said that, but we are just looking forward to it and well take every game as a cup final which I think will suit us because we have got a good group and a good mentality.” googletag.cmd.push UnusualIt is not often that Harps find themselves higher than their Northwest rivals, but that is one of many fascinating subplots which make this another highly-anticipated derby encounter.“We may as well take it when it comes,” McEleney said. “The boys are looking forward to it on Friday. “We know coming up to the Brandywell that Derry have a good record at home. They did well at home last year so we know its going to be a tough game for us, but its just another game of football and thats the way you have to look at it.“ I know its a derby but after  minutes its all over and done with.“Every game, especially the first games, are always cagey. Its always kind of helter-skelter because teams dont really hit a rhythm until five or six games in. Derry have a relatively new squad as well with a lot of new players, so the more points you can put on the board, regardless of performance, the better it stands to you.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theres no doubt about that Finn Harps are our biggest rivals. They are in close proximity and our supporters always look forward to these games and we have to treat it like a cup final. “Its an opportunity for us to get up and running because we lost our first game and we have to make sure that were bang at it on Friday because Harps will be coming confident on the back of a really good result also.”City lost five home games last season, and Devine wants to improve on that record, asking his players to make the Brandywell an dficult venue for visiting teams in .“We want to get points on the board as quickly as possible but we know its going to be dficult,” he continued. “Ive never been involved in an easy one against Finn Harps.“ I think every team in the country is going to be finding their feet over the next couple of weeks and thats whats key. Last year we hit the ground running quite well but every team is going to take time to get up to speed. “At the same time we have got to make sure that the Brandywell is a fortress this year and make it somewhere no-one looks forward to coming and playing. “That is exactly our game plan this week, making sure that we are the team on the ascendancy. We are playing at home and we have got to make sure that home advantage counts.” googletag.cmd.push MemorableCity and Harps had some memorable clashes last year, and a packed Brandywell is expected in anticipation of yet another frenetic derby game. “The pleasing thing for us is that were playing on a brilliant surface, in a brilliant stadium, with a big crowd and a lot of people looking forward to seeing us perform,” he added. “Finn Harps are working off a very big budget this year, being able to attract the players that they have so we have to make sure that we are at our very, very best to show our people and our supporters that we mean business this year.”There are several interesting subplots to tomorrows game, with theof former City captain Barry McNamee at the top of the list. Shane McEleney, Sam Todd, Gareth Harkin and former Harps captain Ciaran Coll will also come up against their former teams.“There a lot of ex-players playing but we just have to go about our jobs,” Devine stated. “Im only concerned about the players wearing red and white on Friday and we have got to make sure they do their jobs as best they can. “I have no doubt they will because they have given serious, serious work in pre-season, their fitness levels are very high and our ability to get around the pitch is very high.“I feel this year that we have a lot of goals in our team and Im looking forward to the game. It will be more about what we do.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE

There could not be a greater contrast than the pancake flat sprint pace of Armagh versus the mud and marsh of cross country, so it will be interesting to see how they fare.The final race of the evening was the open menrsquos K event. Neil Curran was in this race as was Mackenzie Murray, running in the Junior B.Mackenzie was delighted with his race and felt that he was able to control his pace well. The super fast start can be disconcerting and it is hard to judge yourself by those around you.He finished as the ninth Junior B boy in a time of .. A promising run all round.

Despite improving on his time, he was non-committal about his performance, feeling that a lack of speed work had left his legs wanting.Runners can be hard on themselves and should remember that performances that they think lack sparkle, may be times that others may only dream of achieving.Jimmyrsquos recceA call had gone out to our members to take part in a recce of the course for the rapidly approaching Jimmyrsquos .It was decided to open this up to all comers and it was a popular move. With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

This film is her fight to understand the events that shaped her le, in order to move on.The storyline has some parallels with her own le as before her family moved to New York, her father was sentenced to six years in the former Long Kesh prison after being arrested in  on suspicion of carrying a weapon.Apart from writing and filming The Shore at Killough, which was produced by Oorlagh, Terry early earned his film-making credentials as the screenwriter for the film, In the Name of the Father , based on the story of the Guildford Four and wrote the screenplay and directed Some Motherrsquos Son .He has since gone on to write other major films such as The Promise in .While Oolagh worked alongside her father in some of his productions, she has branched out on her own and is currently developing a television drama called Faultline, which she co-created with The Wire writer, Edward Burns.It took six years for Oorlagh Georgersquos screen play of Stranger with a Camera to make it into production. The project has been developed through Sundance Institutersquos Screenwriting and Directing Labs.Oorlagh is producing the film with Mary Ann Marino , Molly Egan , and John Wallace .The film is supported by Sundance Institute, Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland, with additional grant support by The Utah Film Centre and Artemis Rising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Schoolchildren.jpg","title":"Schoolchildren name social housing scheme in Crossgar  ","story":"A NEW social housing scheme in the heart of Crossgar has been officially named.Work on a scheme by Clanmil Housing to build  homes on a former derelict site in Downpatrick Street is nearing completion and has been named Everogue Lane.Housing officials approached Glasswater Primary School and Cedar Integrated Primary School to ask pupils to take part in a competition to name the new development by coming up with an imaginative name that would reflect the sitersquos surroundings or some other interesting aspect of the local area.A total of  entries were received from P pupils at the two schools, the most imaginative of which were submitted to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to select the winning name.The developmentrsquos new name reflects the original name for the village, Everogues Bridge, before it became known as Crossgar, with the winning name a combination of ideas from former Glasswater pupil Grace Chapman and Gabriel Gormley, a former pupil at Cedar.Clanmilrsquos community cohesion officer, Philip Whyte, presented Grace and Gabriel with Amazon Fire tablets in recognition of their creativity.ldquoWe are delighted by the interest that the children have shown in our development and very impressed by the standard and range of names suggested, he said.ldquo Well done to everyone who got involved and thank you to the schools for helping with the competition.ldquoCongratulations to Gabriel and Grace who have together come up with the perfect name for the scheme.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

Goulding was not by any means friends with the Provisional leadership and unlikely to have given over the arms speculation has it that he sold most of the KGB weapons to the Provisional IRA. As to whether these arms became part of the decommissioning process is unknown. Let us hope, in particular for UK security, that MI is ahead of the game.No doubt Monsieur Barnier will be delighted to have Irish republicans at his side in EU negotiations with the UK on future trade arrangements.

Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden. Mr Harden said: “There’s a real possibility that the play could have been lost. The sad reality is that had Joe survived, this production would never have happened. We are here, in so many ways, because like  others in the UK every day, a man took his own le.

She was so up for it.”Askedit’s hard to keep a straight face when you don’t know what’s coming next, Diona said: “The stuff we do with Michael Stranney who plays Craig Carson, the leader of the Continuity Nine , has us breaking down and laughing and having to start again.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was parcelled up as agricultural land and it was to go to farmers and turn into holding pens for sheep and things like that.“The lodge saw an opportunity and formed a development group to buy The Glen and put it back into community use.“We had explained to the girls what we envisaged for the area. “They really got on board with the idea of keeping it on as a legacy of what their family had done for the area. “When it was owned by the Smith family and there was an old linen factory in it, this beautul walkway ran the whole way through it and it was open to community use with an immaculately kept garden at the bottom of it.“Over the past  to  years it fell into disrepair. The lodge saw an opportunity to save this space for the community. If it went on any further it would have been too far gone to work with. You could still walk parts of it, but barely.”Adam added: “We signed the papers approximately six months ago. We’ve done a bit of work ourselves to open a new pathway and cleared existing pathways.“The next part of the project is getting funding to really drive on and preserve it.”Adam estimated there were up to  people living in Glenanne, mostly of a Protestant background, but with some long-established Catholic families.He commented: “Everyone gets on very well. There’s this stigma about Glenanne that it’s this really sectarian place where this gang has come from, the reality is very far from that.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-jeCdPy bGQlOq\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-hgHYgh jDtWHP\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-jeCdPy bGQlOq\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-hgHYgh jDtWHP\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"palestinian documentary screening ","story":"NI man Peter Cardwell loses job in Boris Johnson reshuffleDecision deferred on collegeNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPalestinian documentary screeningA top Palestinian journalist and documentary maker will be attending the screening of an award-winning film in Portadown next month.By Carmel RobinsonThursday, th February , : pmUpdated Thursday, th February , : pm\"\"Community newsHosted by the Portadown branch of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the movie, entitled ‘Naila and the Uprising’ will be shown on March  at pm.It will be followed by a discussion with the film’s producer Rula Salameh in Drumcree Community Centre, Ashgrove Road. Naila and the Uprising chronicles the remarkable real-le journey of Naila Ayesh, a key figure in the First Intada, which forced the world to recognize the Palestinian right to self-determination for the first time.Using evocative animation, intimate interviews, and exclusive archival footage, this film tells the story of a courageous women’s movement at the head of Palestinians’ struggle for freedom, bringing out of anonymity the women activists whose contributions and sacrices changed history, but whose stories have remained untold until now.The presence of Rula Salameh, as part of a ten day IPSC-organised speaking tour across Ireland, will provide an opportunity to hear at first-hand the fears and concerns which Palestinians have for their future.Rula was one of the founders of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation in , following the Oslo Agreement.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
