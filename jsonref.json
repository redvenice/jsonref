But I believe after we say all arrivals have to be quarantined for 14 days from February 8 the number of arrivals will reduce,\u0027 she said.  The outbreak has rekindled memories of the 2003 SARS crisis, another virus which began in China and killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong.           A passenger wearing a face mask looks out from a cabin on the World Dream cruise ship, docked at the Kai Tak cruise terminal in Hong Kong         Passengers stand on the helipad of the 151,000-tonne World Dream cruise liner today         Members of the Hong Kong Department of Health wearing protective gear queue up to clean their hands on the deck of the World Dream cruise ship         A man is transferred to an ambulance after medics took him off the World Dream cruise shipThe latest virus has spread rapidly in China with nearly 25,000 people infected and 490 deaths, most in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei.\u0027As the disease is spreading rapidly in our community, and locally infected cases are steadily increasing, we are dangerously close to a massive community outbreak comparable to SARS,\u0027 said the HAEA hospital workers\u0027 union.   Thousands of medical staff have gone on strike and the Hospital Authority has warned that emergency services are being severely hampered.Hong Kong\u0027s beleaguered public hospital network was suffering from staff shortages and limited hospital beds even before the coronavirus outbreak.Today dozens of medical representatives marched to government headquarters to press their demands for the border to be sealed.

While uncovering the machinery of a fantasy, they also indulge the longing for an invitation to the party. Characters often stand out for their enormous wealth and property, and for the silence and lies that bind them to that exalted status.In the US, for example, the word slavery – the institution that created so much of the nation’s wealth – does not appear anywhere in our constitution, and our fictions dramatise that silence over and over again, showing the strongholds of property and power that defend boundaries of class, colour and bloodline.Often, these are multi-generational stories of families, of great houses. They are tales of place, power, privilege –\u0026nbspand parties, of course. Parties where the uninvited or accidental outsider can sneak in. “Everything happens at a party,” a character remarks in my new novel The Guest Book, which follows three generations of the Miltons, an “old money” family that has run out of cash. The Miltons’ wealth is gone, but not their place – an island off the coast of Maine –\u0026nbspor the sense that it is theirs. “We repeat what we don’t know,” another character says. What this family “doesn’t know” is the racism that underpins their status, the bed beneath their dream. The following fictions taught me how to imagine and shape my own. They are big, juicy stories of love, betrayal and memory rich in the stuff and sorrow of dreams. 1. The Great Gatsby by F Scott FitzgeraldNot much unites the US at the moment, but almost every US citizen has read The Great Gatsby. Why? The benighted, besotted James Gatz from nowhere, from no place, believes he can write his own future, and – given enough money –\u0026nbsprewrite his past. The spectacle of his gorgeous, doomed vision has been taught as the expression of the American Dream and of its impossibility, Gatsby’s glorious parties spinning out into the summer nights, never mind the darkness, never mind the rules of class, or of race, or the truth of the past.2. Run River by Joan DidionDidion’s first novel begins with the sound of a gunshot heard by a woman calmly fastening a watch to her wrist in her bedroom, and takes us back through the events leading up to that shot –\u0026nbspback through her memory, and further back into the history of her family, among the first settlers of the state of California. The novel combines Didion’s characteristically minute observation of class and power with a plot that spins relentlessly forward, never letting you forget that it must return to the moment of that opening shot.3. Howards End by EM ForsterThe Schlegel sisters, clear-eyed, witty members of the intelligentsia, comfortably off and highly educated, are at the centre of a novel that pits their situation and point of view against l of the “new money” family who possess the old family house of the title – a place that burnishes the family’s sense of superiority, even though none of them choose to live there. A secret of inheritance buried at the beginning of the story hangs in plain sight, begging to be revealed.4. Lady Chatterley’s Lover by DH Lawrence I would pair this 1928 novel with Kate Chopin’s The Awakening (1899), both stories about women coming to see the gilded bars surrounding their social class. Chopin’s novel is set in a summer colony off the coast of New Orleans, where the heat and languor and beauty of her cage pairs with the intensity of her sexual awakening. In much the same way, the natural, excessive beauty of the Chatterley estate, the deep green afternoons dripping after rain, underscore Lady Chatterley’s release into a kind of freedom in the arms of the gamekeeper.5. The Age of Innocence by Edith WhartonWharton’s 1920 novel skewers the turn-of-the century Gilded Age, when the social, political and economic power of the US was centred in the 400 families of Old Manhattan who danced in Caroline Astor’s ballroom, and “dreaded scandal more than disease”. Wharton shows the power of a class to ine and then ide true love in a trenchant novel anatomising duty and passion.6. Jane Eyre by Charlotte BrontëJane enters the wealthy House of Rochester as a governess, and finds it to be in possession of a wandering secret, a secret that insists on its telling, a secret in the form of a woman, dark and furious, and shut away. This story of a girl coming to find her voice in the face of a world that would dismiss her is one of my touchstones. 7. The Sound and the Fury by William FaulknerThe story of the beautiful and tragic Caddy Compson is told in three separate monologues by her brothers: the mentally damaged Benjy, the suicidal Quentin, and the monstrous Jason. Chronicling her quest to escape her family, the town in which they live as high-society-gone-to-seed, and the systemic poison of the post-bellum south, the voices in the novel fuse so that you are often not precisely certain who is speaking. At times the story breaks into narration by one of several of the family’s former slaves. The sense of a house, a town and a country in a perpetual state of blindness, though speaking all the while, builds and builds through this masterpiece.8. The Forsyte Saga by John GalsworthyThe immense pleasure of this enormous novel is its breadth, moving slowly, magisterially forward through a wealth of characters, a mass of overlapping secrets, desires and ambitions. Such misunderstandings and false starts might undergird any family, but they centre here on Soames Forsyte, Galsworthy’s “Man of Property”. Beginning in 1896 and ending in the 1920s, it is the saga of a nation seen through the particular lens of one of its families as much as it is a love story and the story of a house.9. Arcadia by Tom StoppardStoppard’s 1993 play tells the tragic story of Thomasina Coverly, moving back and forth between two generations of her family, one in 1809 and the other in the present. The pathos of history – when the past doesn’t know what’s coming, and the present doesn’t know what’s past – is laid bare here. The play, which remains compelling on the page, alternates past and present while remaining in one place – the room of the family’s estate – an image of the layering of history. 10. The Swimmer by John CheeverJust as this list must begin with Gatsby, it must end with John Cheever’s landmark short story from 1964. One midsummer Sunday afternoon, Neddy Merrill sits beside a friend’s pool, one hand around a glass of gin, the other submerged in the water, and decides to swim the eight miles home, through friends’ and neighbours’ yards, from pool to pool. What begins as one man’s lark, firmly rooted in the wealthy suburban world outside New York City, slowly grows into an allegory of the traps and cages of the rich, and of the desperate, physical yearning to swim out of oneself. Where Neddy Merrill finds himself when he reaches home is as hauntingly beautiful as that green light signalling the end of Gatsby’s dream at the end of Daisy’s dock.• The Guest Book by Sarah Blake is published by Viking.

Spearheaded spearheaded by the campaign group ShareAction, they have filed a resolution calling for Barclays to set clear targets to phase out services to energy companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals.But the reported intervention of The Investor Forum, whose members include all the big names in the UK fund management industry – will intensify the pressure on the bank. The Investor Forum declined to comment.Barclays is being targeted because of its leading role in funding fossil fuel projects. A recent study found its lending and underwriting to carbon-intensive companies and projects totalled $85bn (£64bn) between 2015 and 2018.The figure is more than any other British or European bank, and prompted campaign group ShareAction to co-ordinate the landmark resolution tabled for May’s AGM.Barclays said: “We continue to engage with ShareAction and other stakeholders on this issue and will make a further statement at the appropriate time.”Privately, the bank claims the campaign against it is unfair, pointing to figures that show that while it remains a significant banker to the fossil fuel industry, its business with the companies most aggressively expanding in the sector fell sharply, from $13.1bn in 2016 to $5.2bn in 2018. It has also facilitated £27.3bn in ‘green’ bonds and renewable financing.Unlike some other European banks, Barclays has not ruled out funding projects or companies involved in coal or tar sands, regarded as particularly polluting as they require large amounts of energy to extract.Barclays has been subject to protests in its branches from Greenpeace campaigners concerned at the bank’s involvement in tar sands, focusing on the pipelines being built across Canada and the US to bring oil to market from Alberta’s tar sands.If the AGM resolution is approved by shareholders, the bank will have to publish a plan to phase out the provision of financial services to energy companies that are not meeting Paris climate goals. It is understood that since the pension and investment funds filed their resolution, Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins has engaged with institutional investors, with the Financial Times suggesting that the bank is considering putting forward its own climate change plan to stave off the investor revolt.Barclays has some way to go before it meets the standards set by some other European financial giants. Insurer Axa said in 2017 that it was esting from 25 tar sands companies as well as the three large pipelines needed to deliver their oil to market.BNP Paribas, one of the biggest banks in France, has also pledged to stop financing companies whose main activity is extracting oil and gas from shale deposits or tar sands.

Some protesters sat underneath the solar panels after they were prevented from installing them on the pavements and roads near the office.Others locked themselves to oil barrels bearing the BP logo in front of the six doors around the building to stop staff from entering. About half of the activists remained outside the premises in St James’s Square, close to Piccadilly Circus, four hours after the start of the demonstration.One of the protesters, Richard George, said: “This morning, police managed to block our solar installation but BP are trying to block the transition to clean energy on a global scale. Their lobbyists have the ear of governments around the world, they spend millions blocking action to fix the climate emergency and billions on drilling for more oil and gas to make it worse.“Floods, droughts, forest fires and hurricanes all over the globe start right here with the plans made in BP’s headquarters.”Looney, who joined BP in 1991, takes over from Bob Dudley, who steered the oil and gas company through its response to the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010.“The only realistic response to the climate emergency is to cut emissions. BP need to stop wasting billions drilling for more oil and gas that we simply can’t burn, and produce a plan to get out of the oil business entirely.”BP has frequently been challenged by climate change activists, who have targeted its sponsorship of art institutions and its alleged lobbying.In June, protesters from Extinction Rebellion targeted the Royal Opera House during a BP-sponsored screening of Romeo and Juliet.Last year the Royal Shakespeare Company ended its partnership with the oil company, which had sponsored the theatre’s £5 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds.Looney, who was visiting staff in Germany on Wednesday, shared the “deep concerns” of climate protesters, BP said in a statement. He will set out his vision for BP’s response to the low-carbon energy transition in a speech next week. BP said Looney “hopes that what he has to say then will give people a sense that we get it and are very serious about working to address the problem”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c645b8462b7561df416b4011c0c549738ea3df6c/0_347_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f36dd7198f01a689e0b698ccb930453","title":"nissan self driving car leaf longest journey","story":"Autonomous model completes complex 230-mile trip from Bedfordshire to Sunderland A self-navigating car has successfully driven itself for 230 miles, the longest and most complex journey undertaken so far on UK roads by an autonomous vehicle.The Nissan Leaf, fitted with GPS, radar, Lidar laser measurement technology and cameras, travelled from Nissan’s technical centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, to the carmaker’s manufacturing plant in Sunderland, where the model is made.Nissan says vehicle’s advanced positioning technology allows it to assess its surroundings and make decisions about how to navigate roads and obstacles.During the journey, named the GrandDrive, the car travelled on a range of roads alongside traffic, from country lanes to the M1 motorway. The autonomous technology activated along the route whenever the vehicle needed to stop, start or change lanes.The £13.5m HumanDrive project is jointly funded by the British government and an industry consortium of nine partners including Nissan and Hitachi. Its goal is to develop an autonomous vehicle control system that resembles a natural, human driving style. The vehicles have also been driven on test tracks as part of the project.Bob Bateman, the project manager for Nissan’s Europe technical centre, said: “The HumanDrive project allowed us to develop an autonomous vehicle that can tackle challenges encountered on UK roads that are unique to this part of the world, such as complex roundabouts and high-speed country lanes with no road markings, white lines or kerbs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/255776248916c0e2453d6066b407614e0b0fedc7/172_140_2996_1798/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd8ca82e9c4b729e87f89b4a4acdf680","title":"ryanair accused of greenwash over carbon emissions claim","story":"UK watchdog bans advert claiming lowest CO2 pollution of any major airlineRyanair has been accused of greenwashing after the UK advertising watchdog banned an ad campaign claiming that the airline has the lowest carbon emissions of any major airline in Europe.The budget airline, which was named last year as one of Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters in an EU report, later ran a TV, press and radio campaign claiming it was “Europe’s lowest fares, lowest emissions airline”.The ads claim that Ryanair has the “lowest carbon emissions of any major airline”, based on CO2 emissions per passenger per kilometre flown, because it has the youngest fleet, highest proportion of seats filled on flights and newest, most fuel-efficient engines.However, one of the charts Ryanair presented to the Advertising Standards Authority to back up its claims was dated 2011, which the watchdog said was “of little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019”. The ASA added: “In addition, some well-known airlines did not appear on the chart, so it was not clear whether they had been measured.”The ASA also said that the ads failed to factor in seating density – the number of seats per plane – which it considered “significant information that consumers needed in order to understand the basis of the claim”.The ASA banned the ads ruling that they were misleading because the airline had failed to substantiate its environmental claims.“The ads must not appear again in their current forms,” the ASA said. “We told Ryanair to ensure that when making environmental claims they held adequate evidence to substantiate them and to ensure that the basis of those claims were made clear.”The environmental group Transport \u0026amp Environment accused Ryanair of greenwashing instead of tackling its emissions.The airline ran the low-emissions ad campaign just over five months after it became the first non-coal company to be named in the EU top 10 carbon emitters list.“Ryanair should stop greenwashing and start doing something to tackle its sky-high emissions,” said Jo Dardenne, the aviation manager of T\u0026ampE.Ryanair remained defiant, claiming it had abided by the UK advertising code.“Ryanair is both disappointed and surprised that the ASA has issued this ruling given that Ryanair fully complied with advertising regulations, engaging with regulators and providing documentation that fulfilled all the substantiations needed,” said a spokeswoman.The Ryanair boss, Michael O’Leary, has suggested shooting environmentalists and has repeatedly denied that the climate crisis is driven by carbon emissions, which aviation produces in abundance.Last year, Ryanair claimed it was already the greenest airline in terms of carbon emissions per passenger. The company has also pledged to be “plastic free” by 2023 and set up a voluntary carbon offset payment scheme for customers when booking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250f7dc23a9f518c4cbbf50cf77f02709a25b009/26_169_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc5afa1568fc87739e9a8135b2db322","title":"vodafone to remove huawei from core european networks","story":"Move will cost €200m but have limited financial impact on UK operations, says CEO Nick ReadVodafone is to remove Huawei equipment from the sensitive, core parts of its mobile networks across Europe at a cost of €200m (£169m) over the next five years.The group, which has 111 million customers across Europe, has taken the decision after the UK government’s move last week to limit the use of Huawei equipment in the country’s 5G network.Nick Read, Vodafone’s chief executive, said the Huawei equipment replacement programme would have “very limited financial impact” on its UK operations as they were already mostly compliant with the new government measures.Read said if caps were introduced by other countries Vodafone would look to ert money intended for rolling out 5G to the wider replacement of Huawei equipment.Read said no European countries had indicated at this stage that they intended to introduce caps but because the UK had done so, Vodafone wanted to make its position clear on the potential impact.“We need to be rolling out 5G to underpin a competitive landscape in a digital society. The US is racing ahead, China is racing ahead. We can’t hold back 5G deployment and caps would be restrictive on that basis,” he said.On Wednesday, Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, said Britain could work with its allies to introduce another equipment provider to the UK market. With Huawei locked out of the core of 5G networks, and a cap on involvement in non-core systems, operators are left with just two large alternative suppliers in Nokia and Ericsson.“We are very determined … that another provider of 5G equipment is needed in order to provide that resilience to our very important 5G network,” Morgan said.“It may well be we have to work with our international allies as well to make sure we either get another provider who is operating elsewhere to operate in the UK, or potentially to perhaps have another company that’s able to offer that equipment so that we are able to have that resilience in our system.”Last week, BT said limiting the use of Huawei equipment in EE’s 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband networks would cost it £500m over the next five years.Last January, Vodafone “paused” the use of Huawei equipment in its core network across Europe because of the debate about security concerns involving the Chinese telecoms corporation.

The truth is more complex“What is the news from China?” are the words that open the 1900 book World-Crisis in China, though they could equally apply to coverage of coronavirus. The short account of an anti-Christian uprising towards the end of China’s Qing dynasty, written by the journalist Allen Sinclair Will, documented “a startling succession of events that seem destined to shake the world”. Today, a different crisis is unfolding across the country. An outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei province, has infected more than 20,000 people. The World Health Organization has declared it a “global health emergency”.Coronavirus has thrown light on the sheer logistical power of the Chinese state. In a matter of days, the Communist party erected a hospital that would take months to build elsewhere. It has used drones equipped with speakers to force citizens to wear face masks and shut down 16 cities across the country, quarantining an estimated 50 million people. China’s railway operator is using big data to track down passengers who were in the same carriage as those who contracted the virus. International coverage of China’s response has tempered expressions of concern about the country’s authoritarian politics with awe. Yes, Xi Jinping is an autocrat, the thinking seems to be, but he’s also a pragmatist. “Logistically, it’s stunning,” the US public health expert William Schaffner said of the Wuhan quarantine. “It was done so quickly.”This wonder at China’s logistical prowess is symptomatic of a recurrent trope among western commentators. We might call it the “if we could just be China for a day” view. For free-market economies such as Britain and the US, where the private sector has replaced state-run enterprises and public investment in infrastructure has shrunk over decades, China can seem like a miracle. The GDP of its state-controlled economy has more than doubled in the past decade, while its technology companies rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The journalist Thomas Friedman, for example, periodically claims that although he wouldn’t want to see China’s political model become an international standard, he enjoys fantasising about how dramatically his country’s infrastructure could be improved were Beijing’s engineer-leaders free to work their magic.But when it comes to a public health epidemic, there are worrying limits to the Chinese Communist party’s control. To maintain authority, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) must convince the public that everything is going to plan. This hampers its ability to respond to epidemics. Although the first case of coronavirus was reported on 8 December, the Wuhan health authorities took more than three weeks to issue a notice. As New York Times reporters Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers have found, the doctor Li Wenliang warned an online chat group on 30 December of a mysterious illness in the city, but was subsequently required to sign a police statement that his warning constituted “illegal behaviour”. In a statement published the following day on its website, the Wuhan health authority announced that 27 people were affected by pneumonia – and said the disease was “preventable and controllable”.The Sars disease rippled across the world in 2003, helped in part by the Communist party’s attempts to conceal its spread for months. During the Sars outbreak, Hong Kong had greater press freedom than mainland China. This helped accurate information come to light there, mitigating some of the damage of China’s attempts at an official cover-up. The Chinese government’s grip over the internet, media and civil society has tightened dramatically since the Sars outbreak. Under Xi’s rule, the party has taken an increasingly hardline stance towards Hong Kong, attempting to crush democratic protests and bring the territory under tighter control, while its censors have worked diligently to scrub the internet across the mainland of anything that erges from the party’s line. Articles and comments about coronavirus continue to be deleted online and the government has issued warnings against spreading “rumours”. While the party claims to be learning everything it can from the Sars crisis, it seems blind to important lessons.That Beijing is determined to prevent Taiwan from joining the World Health Organization is another glaring example of how party ideologies have trumped pragmatism. Taiwan has long functioned as a self-governing country, but the CCP insists it is part of Chinese territory. Following in the footsteps of organisations such as Interpol, the WHO has acceded to Beijing’s wishes, blocking Taiwan from attending emergency briefings. This has slowed the country’s access to international health information – despite Taiwan already counting 10 cases of coronavirus. Cooperation is essential in dealing with public health crises, yet Xi’s technocrats are allowing the control of the one-party state to take precedence over sharing information as widely as possible.The WHO has praised China’s response to coronavirus for setting a “new global standard” for epidemic control. On closer inspection, China’s response should give us serious pause. Although the country is keen to show the world that it has progressed since Sars, it’s difficult to tell whether drastic containment – such as quarantining entire cities – would have been necessary had the party disclosed information about the virus more quickly. The one-party state’s survival depends upon controlling information, suppressing dissidence and restricting press freedoms. In the case of coronavirus, it seems little has changed.• Jeffrey Wasserstrom teaches Chinese and world history at UC Irvine and is the author of Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/985b0a9cf237ef876715069cbfcf4919595a51f5/310_27_2699_1620/master/2699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae482a86ca9547f13055b966e9775807","title":"levelling up let tories off hook conservative policies","story":"The latest political earworm is a way of avoiding the uncomfortable realities that Conservative policies have createdGet Brexit done. Deliver on the result of the referendum. Strong and stable. Catchphrases have always been a predictable staple of political campaigning, but we’ve been treated to a particular abundance in recent years. They’re the sort of phrases that litter every news story or televised speech, that burrow into your brain to lay their horrible eggs, hatching periodically to bring the words “dither and delay” unbidden to the front of your mind while you’re eating breakfast.The latest political earworm is “level up”. This phrase, frequently heard from Boris Johnson’s mouth, is fast becoming one of those clanging catchphrases, the endless repetition of which makes you wish you could jettison yourself into space in order to die as far away from Westminster as possible. It’s the opposite of an instant classic: it’s tired and irritating, right from the first time you hear it.The phrase featured prominently in the 2019 Tory manifesto, along with the imperative to “unleash” things such as innovation and Britain’s potential, in the manner of, say, the hounds. The promise to “level up” Britain appears no fewer than 11 times in the unusually short manifesto, mostly in reference to spreading wealth to regions other than London, but also to improved education and healthcare outcomes.“Level up” is as close to meaningless as it’s possible for it to be without being written in Wingdings. The 2019 manifesto was intended as a thin document, difficult to analyse or find issue with, and “level up” did a lot of the semantic heavy lifting. It’s the verbal equivalent of Polyfilla: a neat way of breezing past details such as what exactly will be improved, how much it will be improved by, who will do the improving, and why those improvements are needed in the first place. Far easier to “level up” the north and Midlands than to confront the painful legacies of former Conservative policies such as deindustrialisation and austerity.It’s also a bizarre co-opting of gaming language. Intentionally or not, the phrase hits the ear like a patronising appeal to young people and their video games. You guys like Fortnite? Why not try the latest Tory Britain expansion pack? Level up to unlock achievements such as adequate school funding, sufficient public transport infrastructure and a slightly less crushing sense of disappointment with the state of modern Britain.But, as with any new piece of political jargon, it’s not simply annoying – although it is unbelievably annoying – it’s also deeply suspect. The writer Jonathan Meades called jargon the “prissy net curtains of language”. Political jargon is primarily about artifice, about projecting a certain image of the party and of the politician speaking. In this case, Conservative politicians can sidestep the thorny issue of gaping economic inequalities. “Levelling up” implies improvements for the needy without any redistribution of wealth or opportunity from the wealthiest. This, by definition, is impossible.Already, just eight weeks after the election, it’s clear that the rhetoric of “levelling up” is at odds with the government’s true ambitions. A planned reallocation of council funding may redirect millions of pounds away from the north of England, rerouting it into traditional Conservative heartlands in the south and away from the regions with the highest incidence of poverty, including places such as Redcar, Wolverhampton and Middlesbrough – the same places that the government has promised to “level up”.Meanwhile, a value-for-money review of government departments could cut off funding for a swathe of projects launched under David Cameron and Theresa May. To use another insidiously passive piece of political jargon, “left behind” people will continue to be left behind by the Tories. “Level up” is a semantic move to disguise an enduring truth: that, really, levelling the playing field was never on the Conservative party’s agenda.• Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bc18d23ac1f56d55270cafb0ac0da21670d5a3/0_116_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5048f7301d6e81e28ad7a1215406552e","title":"south african photographer santu mofokeng in pictures","story":"The documentary photographer, best known for recording everyday life in the townships of South Africa, has died.

The government has my backing as they go forward.”Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. Lord Barker of Battle, who served as an energy and climate change minister under Cameron and is a close friend and ally of the former prime minister, told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Tuesday that he understood Cameron felt “it was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role”.The former Conservative leader William Hague was also reported to have been offered it and to have also declined.On Tuesday during the conference’s launch event, Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job.The former clean growth minister Claire O’Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, was sacked on Friday as president of the talks by the prime minister’s special adviser, Dominic Cummings. The government said the post would be a ministerial role in future.The UN climate talks, to be held in Glasgow in November, are the most important since the Paris agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015.Countries are expected to deliver more ambitious domestic plans for cutting greenhouse gases by 2030, as current proposals are not enough to prevent dangerous temperature rises.Pressure is also on countries to set out long-term plans for cutting emissions, with the science clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The run-up to the talks will require a major diplomatic effort from the UK to secure ambitious climate action from countries, at a time when Britain is also negotiating trade agreements with the EU and other nations.On Tuesday Johnson set out his vision for forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis, promising “we will crack it”.Johnson has brought forward the UK’s phaseout of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years to 2035 and hastened the phaseout of coal-fired power by a year to 2024. He reaffirmed the UK’s pledge to switch to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and urged other nations – without naming any – to do the same.“I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,” Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. “We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let’s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve manmade climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a932c0bb9119a0d278d8684f7714341196b458f/0_98_3088_1852/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a738e288f57da917c0d23bca460b1a","title":"choose vintage avoid stretch how to wear jeans sustainably","story":"The environmental impact of denim makes buying jeans problematic for eco-conscious shoppers. But more and more brands are developing innovative ways to lessen the damageWhy are jeans so controversial? Is it the estimated 10,000 litres of water needed to grow the cotton for every pair? The dark blue lines of toxic pollution in China’s Pearl River that can be seen from space? The potassium permanganate, widely used to make new jeans look old and distressed, that may cause lung damage in workers? Or is it because there is no guarantee that those workers are paid a living wage, never mind being paid for the overtime they are forced to do?“The denim industry is at a pivotal moment,” says Roian Atwood, senior director of global sustainable business at Kontoor Brands, which owns Wrangler and Lee, when we met at ART (Art Repair Transform), a denim upcycling and mending workshop at the Copenhagen international fashion last month. Lee are among the 30 brands contributing to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign project, a new initiative governing all aspects of jean production from regeneratively farmed fibres to washing and finishing techniques – potassium permanganate, for example, is not allowed. Jeans must be made with rivets and hardware that can easily be removed after the jeans are no longer fit for purpose, allowing them to be recycled into something new. The first products bearing the Jeans Redesign logo will go on sale in the autumn.The industry is working hard to make itself cleaner and more sustainable, investing in new technology such as the innovative dry foam to dye Lee’s Indigood jeans – the use of water is pretty much eliminated, as well as reducing energy and chemicals and hopefully ending the rivers of toxic blue effluent. Already in operation at three denim mills in Spain, Mexico and India, Lee is also launching “compostable” jeans this spring. “They will fully decompose,” says Atwood. “We believe it will take 200 days.”There is still a long way to go. According to Atwood, there is “a new and emerging environmental issue we are not quite ready to talk about yet, which is that denim has become integrated with a lot of synthetics. The comfort and the stretch movement, athleisure and the omnipresence of the yoga pant have given rise to a lot more stretch in denim. It’s plastic,” he says. And as such, your skinny jeans are responsible for shedding microplastics.Appropriately enough, we meet in the “confessional booth” designed for visitors to confess their fashion sins and record them for a podcast. “If we are confessing our sins, I am here to say I like to wear light jeans,” he says. “A dark pair of denim uses less water in the wash-down process.” The lighter the denim, the more washing processes it has been through and the more water it has used.The designer Duran Lantink, who was commissioned to work with Lee’s deadstock to create a small collection of upcycled denim, wears jeans every day (he switches between two vintage pairs) but is aware of the issues. “I think that, by buying a pre-washed jean, it is ruin in reverse,” he says. “I don’t get that.”Lantink is part of a growing band of designers who are not just concerned about the environmental impact of the industry but also its waste. Bethany Williams, who has perfected the art of unpicking and upcycling unwanted jeans, has grown a cult following. Brands such as E.L.V. Denim (short for East London Vintage), which is sold at a range of stockists including Net-a-Porter, are building healthy businesses using secondhand denim as their raw material. “There are more jeans than people in the world,” says founder Anna Foster. At her studio and showroom, clients can choose from off-the-peg or custom-made jeans, ingeniously spliced together a few miles away at the Blackhorse Lane Ateliers in Walthamstow. But slowing down production is not on the agenda for the big denim brands, who would prefer to cut their environmental impact by reducing water and chemical consumption while continuing to produce at the same levels. However, there are some smart and potentially highly disruptive initiatives coming from smaller independents. Netherlands-based Mud Jeans offers a subscription system that allows you to lease your jeans for €7.50 per month, including free repairs. Once you are finished with your jeans, you send them back and they will be recycled. Hiut Jeans, which has revitalised the denim industry in Cardigan, Wales, makes just 100 pairs of jeans per week. “We are here to try and make the best jeans we can and not the most jeans we can,” it says. It also offer free repairs for life.Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand.Raw denim hasn’t been washed and treated multiple times.

In 1928, the automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler set out to create the greatest skyscraper on Earth, but the record for the world’s tallest building was held for only 11 months before it was overshadowed by the Empire State Building. The terraced crown that is the Chrysler’s most distinctive feature – a seven-storey decorative shell without floors or glazed windows – was dismissed by critics as a gimmick.But, in 2020, the Chrysler is the height of fashion. It has become an architectural icon, a beloved art deco treasure, as symbolic of Manhattan as the Eiffel Tower is of Paris. And the signature silhouette – the elegant, wedding-cake tiers, graphic but graceful, tapering skyward – is the most on-trend shape. The tiered dress is to fashion today what the hourglass was during the New Look craze of 1947 or what the bellbottom was to 1971. The first trend of the new decade is here – and it is 2os skyscraper chic.You may be wearing this dress already without realising how cutting edge you are. In its wearable, everyday form, it has a simple neckline and skims the body to the waist, where it connects to a waist-to-hip tier with a little more fabric, so that the silhouette gets looser and a little wider. A little lower, there is another horizontal seam and a lower tier with yet more fabric, and so on, to the hem. The fabric is soft and unstructured, so that the shape falls with a natural gravity, rather than a grand, stiff kind of volume.The Chrysler silhouette crosses all fashion ides. It was a key look for fashion’s biggest labels in their first collections of this decade. There was a monochrome gown at Chanel, with white buttons on a white bodice and a floor-length skirt of three tiers of black organza. At Dior, a polka-dot sheer dress was embroidered at the horizontal seams iding the four stacked layers of the skirt, to emphasise the tiered construction.Tiers were everywhere, from the avant garde catwalk of Simone Rocha – where overlapping layers of black lace were worn with a crochet harness and a latex skullcap – to Óscar de la Renta, the favourite label of New York’s socialites, where a floral, floor-length gown in tiers of cream and caramel, with matching belt and bag, was garden-party perfect.What is remarkable about the popularity of the Chrysler shape is that this dress does not make you look thin. It does not emphasise the waist, nor does it slim your silhouette. It simply does not kowtow to the age-old tyranny of thinness in fashion. This makes it supremely relaxing to wear – you can breathe out, literally – which lends it a laid-back kind of mood-music when you wear it. They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but the triumph of the tiered dress shows that, in fashion, this is no longer the case. “Flattering” is no longer the be-all and end-all of compliments, from a style point of view. There is a modern take on dressing up that is more about glamour and less about sex appeal.The first noteable on-screen appearance of a tiered dress in modern pop culture came in Killing Eve, in the form of the pink Molly Goddard frock worn by Villanelle. It was an unforgettable fashion moment precisely because the aesthetic impact was so unsettling. Traditionally, sugar-pink is the most feminine of colours, an international aesthetic code for conventional prettiness. But splayed on the sofa in her giant triangular dress, Villanelle had all the cockiness of a man-spreader on a tube carriage. The natural successor to Villanelle was Gemma Chan at last year’s Oscars, with one hand in the pocket – pocket! – of her Valentino gown, which was constructed in 12 horizontal layers of hot-pink parachute silk. Ariana Grande, returning to the Grammys last month after skipping 2019’s ceremony, pulled a similar tiered-gown power move in the vast pyramid of a Giambattista Valli gown in a sombre shade of slate grey.A lot of you – and I mean a lot of you – have worn this dress already, because it was the basic shape of the £40 Zara polka-dot dress that stole summer 2019. But where that dress had just two layers to its tiered skirt, the 2020 model usually has three or more, which is what gives it that skyscraper-esque, Chrysler-shaped ambition. (Zara has a graphic white mini version, for £29.99, which takes aim at your holiday wardrobe.)The lesson of the Zara dress, as the high street learned, is that – mindful not to overshop – we are increasingly drawn to what buyers call the three-day-a-week dress. This is a dress that works with flats and heels, for work and weekends, and lasts a day-to-night wear because it is comfy and doesn’t crease too much. It is a dress you can rely on, a dress you pack for every trip because it gets you out of wardrobe trouble. At its most sober and office-appropriate, this can be a shirt dress – Toast has an elegant collared dress in drapey viscose crepe, with softly gathered tiers and a scattered floral print, for £170. In its most fashionable form, the Chrysler dress cross-pollinates with Americana in its other vogueish form. The prairie dress is where Scandi chic meets pop culture’s yeehaw trend, in which the cowboy is making a postmodern comeback. (Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road wasn’t the longest-running No 1 in US chart history for nothing.)The prairie version of a Chrysler dress features some kind of Little House on the Prairie detailing – a Laura Ashley-esque fabric, a puffed sleeve, smocking – as well as the modish, Fab-lolly-tiered silhouette. Copenhagen-chic label Ganni and London-based Rixo, both of which have been well ahead of the Chrysler curve for several seasons, have western-inspired styles. Rixo’s Becky dress, £335, has a high frilled neckline and puff sleeves. Ganni’s seersucker check shirt-dress has a raised waistband, and four tiers to its skirt, for £225.The Chrysler shape is all about modern urban elegance, and the principle works just as well for clothes as for architecture.

Stateside moviegoers in the ‘60s looked at the latest releases from the big-name masters – Bergman, Kurosawa, Godard – as two-hour passports to far-off lands, and the ineffable Italian-ness of Fellini’s cinema played a significant role in its US reception. As world-weary gossip columnist Marcello Rubini, the great Marcello Mastroianni embodied the image of Euro-cool, resplendent in his jet-black sunglasses and slickly tailored suits. The film’s rear-projection driving scenes are, simply put, the greatest in the history of the medium Americans were instantly smitten with Marcello’s sporty little hot rod, his disaffected scowl, and the seductive artifice of the filmed nighttime splayed across the background.With over a half-century of perspective, it makes perfect sense that that exotic quality would’ve been a major draw for domestic viewers at the time, considering how alien Marcello’s inner struggle is to the American way of life. He’s tormented by his own conscience, caught between the promise of the sacred (marriage, family, religion) and the temptations of the profane (sex, wealth, luxury). He makes his entry literally straying from the path of Christ, peeling off from the trail of a helicopter transporting a Jesus statue to flirt with some sunbathing beauties who can’t hear him over the chopper. Throughout the film, he navigates a tony milieu of nobles and socialites unfamiliar to and incompatible with American terrain.The passage of time has double-underscored the disconnect between the alluring sleekness of Italian high society and its gauche equivalent in the States, where all money is new money. Fellini dazzled with visions of indulgence so intoxicating that they could conceal the moral rot festering within, but our one-percenters could never quite get the hang of that, and they’ve only gotten worse. At this point, it’s nearly nostalgic to revisit a time when being rich was so damn tasteful.Marcello stumbles through the episodic plot as he stumbles through his own existence, fundamentally passive about his cushy lifestyle. He makes a good salary paying off waiters to let slip which Duke had the snails, and when he gets tired of the mistress that he goes to when he gets tired of his wife, he can cavort about with a buxom Swedish movie star. He has access to the uppermost slice of the upper crust, welcome at their parties and an eligible sexual prospect. His trouble is that he has just enough moral fiber to feel shame about their excesses, and yet not quite enough to commit himself to a more principled path.La Dolce Vita remains the ravishing, existentially punishing experience that it’s always been because Fellini does a bangup job selling us on sin. He gives in to his urges to cue up the film’s most famed sequence, the frolic in the Trevi fountain with the Swede starlet portrayed by Anita Ekberg. At first, he resists her invitations to join her in the water, joining her in a symbolic concession to the flesh. His internal plight is understandable it would take a titanium will to resist the dizzying mix of rushing water and blonde hair and black fabric. Glamour on that level seeps out of everything, from the chic costuming to the slinky dance moves and the gorgeous interior production design. With corrosion of the soul like this, who needs virtues?For every decade since its original gutting at Fellini’s hands, the ideal of extreme wealth has lost a little bit of its luster. The 1960s were really the final years before the upper class would be subsumed by the soul-deep tackiness that came to define the moneyed elite in the second half of the twentieth century. New York’s new It Attraction is the TWA Hotel, a retro-aesthetic novelty harkening back to the Mad Men era, and its paradigm of haute style. The 70s and 80s, with the surge of new millionaires minted in the wake of Reaganomics, introduced the image of the over-tanned, proudly garish moneybags as the new standard of class. The purest avatar of that movement now sits in the White House, providing new living proof on a daily basis that money can’t buy you class. (To quote a woman who successfully infiltrated the glitterati, and then went to work dragging the Count-and-Countess set down to her brow level.)Shifting sociological tides have turned capital into a mark of shame, and completely reoriented ideas of status. The emerging generation of young people aspire to more meaningful things than a hefty bank account, and find only distaste in the exclusive and rarefied nature that made Marcello’s subjects a topic of interest. Marcello may have been influential enough to coin the term paparazzi, but the gossip columnist is on his way out as a fixture, supplanted by the everywhere-at-once panopticon of social media. Royalty itself has come to feel passé, as the two most outward-facing members of the Crown family step down from their stations. The oldest families in America are no longer objects of envy, but emblems of decline.Marcello ends the film unmoored, shouting unheard words, just as in his first appearance. He has no idea what to do with all of the ugliness he perceives in his beautiful world, symbolized by the ghastly mutant fish that washes up on the pristine Italian beach in this final scene. The viewer may share in his despair, as he’s caught once again between the sacred and profane. But there’s also penumbra of envy to it, that at least he had plenty of the sacred to go around.

It is a formulaic mashup of Four Weddings and a Funeral and My Best Friend’s Wedding.Erskine plays Alice, a smart Japanese-American woman who has just had a tough breakup with her boyfriend her dorky best friend, Ben (Jack Quaid), is also single. So they agree to be each other’s plus one at all the mortifying weddings they’ve got invited to this year. Ben and Alice are always wisecracking and kidding around together and mocking the cute nonsense of weddings, and Alice is always setting Ben up with the hot women they see there. (“I totally microwaved that hot meet-cute for you!”) But then … well, you know what’s coming.Erskine is strong in this film and handles the tonal transitions pretty well – and the movie has an interesting and original idea, when Ben’s orced dad Chuck (Ed Begley Jr) asks him to be best man at his wedding, to the horror of Ben, who hasn’t entirely forgiven him for running out on his mom. Maybe that premise, with all its rich cringe potential, should have been the whole point of this film.Plus One itself runs perfectly efficiently, but the sense of deja vu is just too overwhelming, right down to the montage of moments at the end, and it is always requiring its co-leads to burst out in affectionate teasing laughter at each other.

Most energy snacks use the dates to bind the other ingredients together. They are rich, caramelly and chewy, but they can also be a bit grainy and sticky. These energy balls are smooth and glossy due to the emulsifying effect of the melted dark chocolate.

Fortunately, if you’re making it in domestic quantities, you don’t need to be a man, let along a strong one, to make perfect aligot.Though François-Régis Gaudry’s gloriously comprehensive book Let’s Eat France informs me that aligot was bread-based until a series of failed wheat harvests in the 17th century (the curious should note that Anne Willan’s French Regional Cooking contains a recipe using bread), potatoes are now de rigeur. As Elizabeth David notes in French Provincial Cooking, it’s one of the few French potato dishes suited to the floury varieties more common in the UK. Many American recipes use waxy potatoes, whose lower starch content does not make them ideal for this purpose, though if that’s all you have, by all means use them. Moderately floury potatoes such as Rooster, maris pipers or desiree are much better (I only list them in such length because potato buying can be confusing in the UK, with spuds labelled simply as “roasting” or “salad”, rather than anything more specific, so do check the small print).To retain as much starch in the potato as possible, I’d advise cooking them whole in their skins, then peeling the skins off afterwards, like Strang, Diana Henry, Geraldene Holt and Elizabeth David (who watched the dish being made in a hotel kitchen in Entraygues after hearing about it from “a very ancient lady in the shop where I was buying local cooking pots”). It takes a bit longer, but the peeling is much faster, and you end up with drier potatoes to boot.What aligot does have in common with other French mashed potato recipes, however, is an almost sinister smoothness. In theory, all mashed, rather than crushed, potatoes ought to be smooth, but here I mean really smooth, silky-smooth: as smooth as a newly waxed leg in sheer tights, which is a goal that’s easier to achieve with a food mill or potato ricer than a standard British masher. Some recipes suggest using a food processor in shocking contravention of the accepted wisdom that cooked potatoes + mechanical blades  glue. Actually, glue isn’t unhelpful if you’re after a show-stoppingly stretchy consistency, but it can’t be denied that creamy is preferable to gluey, so if you’re able to put in the elbow grease yourself, it’s worth it here.David and Holt’s French Country Kitchen both instead recommend caerphilly, “a mild cheese that melts easily” – and indeed, the flavour profile of both caerphilly and crumbly lancashire are suitably acidic. Even better, however, is cheshire – the modern, supermarket sort, rather than the rightly lauded old-fashioned type made by the likes of Appleby’s, which has less salt and a fresh, almost lemony bite. But to my disappointment, cheshire does not melt easily, so the best compromise I find is creamy lancashire – milder and milkier than the crumbly kind, but perfect for this purpose.Many older recipes tell you to add the cheese in thin slices, rather than grating it in. I try both methods, and I’m still puzzled why it would make any difference: all suggestions appreciated.But, however you cut it, you’ll need to make sure the potato mixture is still warm enough to melt the cheese, so put the pan back over a very low heat, or if you’re nervous of it sticking, use a bain-marie, as Ferguson does, because I can confirm you’ll need a determined dog to clean the pan if it does. You’ll also have to beat the mixture hard Stein and Erskine recommend using a whisk, but you’ll need a strong one, or a strong arm and a wooden spoon. Local lore says you should stir the pan in only one direction, but I’m ambivalent on this point.Though you might think cheese needed no extra gilding, all the recipes I try add extra dairy – often butter, but always cream, whether single, double or cultured in the form of creme fraiche only Stein adds milk instead. I don’t think that butter is necessary, mostly because I like to eat aligot in quantity, and butter makes it too rich to do this comfortably. But a generous dollop of creme fraiche, as in Holt and Gaudry’s versions, helps amplify the natural tanginess of the cheese, while milk loosens the texture, so it slides satisfyingly around the plate.1kg floury potatoes (eg, maris pipers, desiree, Roosters), all of roughly the same size 280g creamy Lancashire50-150g firm mozzarella250g creme fraiche120ml milk1 garlic clove, peeledSalt and ground white pepperScrub the potatoes clean, if necessary, then submerge them in a pan of lightly salted water. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender.Meanwhile, grate the cheeses. Once the potatoes are tender, drain them and use a tea towel to rub off their skins (obviously they will be very hot).Put them through a food mill or potato ricer, then push them through a sieve or mash them very well, until you have a smooth puree. Crush the garlic clove.Put the puree back into the pan and put on a very low heat. Stir in the creme fraiche and garlic along with enough milk to make a viscous puree, then use a wooden spoon or sturdy whisk to stir in the cheese in a couple of batches.Beat the potato vigorously until the cheese is melted (and the texture smooth) and the mix comes away from the side of the pan. It will develop a slight sheen that lets you know it’s ready – add more milk if it seems too firm. Season with salt and white pepper and serve immediately.• Aligot: the world’s best mash, or a fine dish ruined by camera phones?

Top chefs from Yotam Ottolenghi to Tom Kerridge reveal what they would buy for under a fiverIt is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain’s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend – what would you buy??The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don’t think British people understand how powerful it is. It’s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it’s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you’re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour.The Too Good to Go app helps fight food waste. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant – maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us – filled with food that would have been binned. You can’t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost £3 for £9- or £10-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White’s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden’s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day.I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs.I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They’re my go-to knives for daily prep – ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about £5.Buy 200g, ide into 10 cubes and freeze them inidually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it’s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes.A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That’s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You’ll notice the difference.I’m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. I’m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It’s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It’s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you’ve got a delicious dinner.If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok’s curves, it’s like having your own hand in there. It’s much easier to move things around and char them properly. I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods’ British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It’s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice.My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything. It tastes delicious stirred into cooked rice. I would recommend this to any home cook. After cutting freshly made gnocchi, you roll it softly across the board to score it, not just to make it pretty but also to create a better surface area for your pasta sauce to coat. This little board can also be used for different pastas as such garganelli and conchiglie.Marmite is essential in my cooking. Controversially, perhaps, I always add a teaspoon to the chicken broth in which I cook my goat meatballs. A dollop of this pungent, salty sauce in any meat or veggie dish, stock or stew adds a flavoursome punch.I buy my vegetables at Church Street Market, near Edgware Road, London. The traders sell bowls of veg for £1. You might get five aubergines in one or a couple of white cabbages, which I use to make sauerkraut in the winter. For £5 you can get a grade-A French black-legged chicken. On Fridays, there is a chap who sells squabs for £2.50. It’s first class.Most non-stick pans last three months if you’re lucky and might cost £35. We buy 50 Ikea ones at a time for £2.75 each. The non-stick only lasts weeks in a professional kitchen, but then we just use them as normal pans until they die. I’ve been doing this over 10 years. They used to be 79p!Just a teaspoon of Gentleman’s Relish can elevate a simple tomato sauce into something really special. Anchovy paste is a great way to add serious depth to your cooking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c3c6f465f8ae47d14f5d281c89626991348be47/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75888c36afd36a89801f2b369fae077e","title":"barcelona meltdown lionel messi eric abidal","story":"• Sporting director had blamed players for Valverde sacking• Messi can leave club in summer thanks to contract clauseBarcelona were plunged into crisis when Lionel Messi publicly called out the sporting director Eric Abidal, challenging him to name names and accusing him of tarnishing the players’ reputation.The Argentinian furiously reacted to what he saw as Abidal’s attempt to lay the blame for the recent sacking of Ernesto Valverde with the players, and demanded the Frenchman take responsibility for his own decisions. His outburst is all the more significant because Messi has a clause in his contract which enables him to unilaterally walk away for free at the end of the season.Abidal claimed Barcelona’s players had not been happy with Valverde, who was sacked on 13 January, and that they had not been working hard enough under their former manager. The response from Messi was swift, public and unequivocal.It will also have lasting consequences, bringing internal ision into the open and laying bare the deep dissatisfaction many in the dressing room feel with the club’s board. An atmosphere of tension already surrounded the club, with criticism growing of the current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and the accusations of failure at an institutional as well as a footballing level.Abidal said he had started to look into replacing Valverde following the clásico on 18 December. He was eventually sacked after a public pursuit of potential replacements, starting with Xavi Hernández and Ronald Koeman and going through a handful of other candidates before, backed into a corner, finally settling on Quique Setién.Messi reacted by posting a picture of the interview on Instagram, with a red circle around one part which read: “The man in charge of the sporting directorate explains that ‘lots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much’.” Underneath, he denied that the sacking was the players’ responsibility and accused Abidal of “dirtying” the squad.“Finally, I think that when players are talked about, names should be given because, if not, we are all being dirtied and it feeds comments that are made and are not true.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200203-59485-gnl.fw.20200203.ds.cityslip.mp3 In the summer, Messi had admitted that he wanted the club to sign Neymar, which they failed to do. “I don’t know if they did everything they could,” he said. Nor did they succeed in bringing in a striker during this transfer window.Abidal is a former teammate of Messi’s but his position is likely to be untenable. He was already under threat after the way the search for a manager was handled and following a transfer window in which Barcelona failed to sign a striker and instead sold two forwards, Carlos Pérez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make way for a player who never came.That sense of crisis and collapse was deepened on Tuesday when it was confirmed that Ousmane Dembélé will be out for the rest of the season with a ruptured tendon in a thigh, while Luis Suárez is also not expected to be back to full fitness until the final weeks of the season at best. The spectre of losing Messi, so often the man holding Barcelona together in recent years, is a terrifying one for the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31d874637e89902b517aa0f601f3ece4c385ea34/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9767d60b3c6d0f7bb0c53c9245dde69","title":"the unpredictables liverpool leicester and sheffield united make fools of us all","story":"It is hard to predict what a season holds in store in August, but a team taking 73 points from 75, Leicester’s rise and Chris Wilder’s Blades have surprised in equal measure There is a downside to these winter breaks, as more and more people are starting to notice. With no Premier League games to talk about at the moment discussion will be mostly suspended until a proper fixture list returns. In the meantime there is just the league table to look at, 25 games in. Clearly a lot can still happen between now and the end of the season, but most of the issues appear to have been settled already.With a record-breaking lead at the top of the table Liverpool are not going to be caught, and it seems unlikely now that Manchester United or Wolves, let alone Sheffield United, will manage a top-four finish. If fourth place is up for grabs, the contest will be between José Mourinho’s past and present: Chelsea and Tottenham.Down at the bottom, although anyone in the lower half is theoretically in danger, Norwich and West Ham have the most work to do and the main point of interest is likely to be which of the clubs above Watford will be dragged into the mire if Nigel Pearson continues his impressive rescue work at Vicarage Road.So far so predictable, you might say, except that this newspaper’s prediction for Watford was a comfortable 11th-place finish. No European cigar, but no relegation panic either, and certainly not three managers before Christmas. By the same token, absolutely no one on these pages back in August foresaw the rise and rise of Sheffield United. The consensus was that the Blades, far from sitting in a Europa League position with an outside chance of overtaking Tottenham, would not only get relegated but would finish bottom. One never knows quite what to expect with promoted sides, and Sheffield United and Norwich are cases in point, though it appears it may be a mistake to base any Premier League assumptions on the way they performed in the Championship the previous season.For anyone unfamiliar with ’s annual exercise in footballing guesswork, all the regular reporters at Premier League games are invited at the start of each season to submit a suggested final table, and the results are then pooled to preserve anonymity and produce a sort of aggregate of opinion. This does not make it any more accurate, as readers will know, though at least inidual writers are spared months of below-the-line mockery if they get things spectacularly wrong. On that score this writer is prepared to admit that his table had Liverpool at the top and Norwich in the bottom three, though most of the stuff in the middle was nothing to brag about.But then lots of the averaged table was completely wrong too that’s the fun of this Nostradamus routine. Collectively, we had Manchester City as champions for a third year running, with Tottenham and Chelsea in third and fourth places and Newcastle, Brighton and Sheffield United going down. Comparing the predicted table with the real thing at the moment, only two clubs occupy the positions we forecast – Chelsea in fourth and Southampton in 13th – although we were close in having Everton and Wolves in eighth and ninth, when they are currently ninth and eighth. That would have been Marco Silva’s Everton, of course we would have had no clue that Carlo Ancelotti would end up in charge at Goodison, something that still seems a little unreal.Similarly, we were not banking on Mauricio Pochettino leaving Spurs, Brendan Rodgers leading Leicester into Champions League contention or Steve Bruce doing such a fine job of stabilising Newcastle. What stands out, though, is how badly West Ham and Watford have underperformed. The latter appear to have found a manager who can at least give them a fighting chance, whereas David Moyes seems permanently surprised at how much things have deteriorated since he was last at the club.If points were awarded or deducted for how much clubs have defied expectations over the course of the season so far, Leicester City and Sheffield United would be close to the top of the league and West Ham might be right at the bottom, with Manchester United and Arsenal dawdling in mid-table. Not that there is any need to construct such a hypothetical model. West Ham are close to bottom of the real table, Leicester and Sheffield United near the top and Manchester United and Arsenal in between. There is just the one significant distinction to make.Though Leicester and Sheffield United are close to the top of the table, that does not mean either are close to Liverpool. Even Manchester City are not close to Liverpool, and from the sound of it a 22-point gap is causing Pep Guardiola some pain. When it comes to doing far better than expected Liverpool have surely raised the bar for all time.Quite a few people other than me thought they might be champions this year, based on their performance last season and continued improvement under Jürgen Klopp, but absolutely no one was predicting 73 points from a possible 75 to open up such a huge gap on their challengers. That is simply not the sort of thing anyone would dare predict, even anonymously.To put the present league table into context, no one has a bad word at the moment for Chris Wilder and his Sheffield United players, who instead of nailed-on relegation certainties are a couple of results from the comfort of the 40-point mark. Everyone agrees that the Blades are having a tremendous season, yet they still do not have half Liverpool’s number of points. In fact if you add Sheffield United’s and Tottenham’s points, you arrive at Liverpool’s 73.At which point there is space left for one further prediction.Not that Liverpool will continue in this vein for the remaining 13 games, because winning the title early could make a difference and so might Europe, but that Klopp and his players are going to find it hard to match this level of relentlessness next season and nigh-on impossible to better it. The only way to improve on 73 points from 25 games is to take 75 points from 25 games, after all. Liverpool are only human, whatever the league table might suggest, and if for that reason alone perfection is supposed to be unattainable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7e2f17e896b38be4e25cd484598d8454252f89f/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4c04b66e8df94c2f87b0a172a6812b6","title":"rohingya demand role in running camps and tell ngos stop ignoring us bangladesh cox bazar","story":"Refugees in Cox’s Bazar complain the international aid community does not utilise their experience and say the lack of education risks creating a ‘lost generation’In a tea room just outside Bangladesh’s Rohingya refugee camps, a group of young activists fiddle with their phones, which have suddenly started pinging in chorus now they are finally reconnected to the internet.To circumvent a government internet blackout around the camps in Cox’s Bazar, they have to break a ban on travelling to nearby Bangladeshi towns, from where they can communicate and coordinate messages for the international community.With simple smartphones the activists have been able to build some kind of Rohingya voice, speaking to the world through WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. But their efforts have often been frustrated, mostly for a more fundamental reason than the technological barrier in place since August: they believe the aid community sent to help them is not listening.“The Rohingya community are not weak, but the situation makes us weak,” says Mohammad Arfaat, an activist who was part of a Rohingya team that made a short film about how violence had forced them from Myanmar in 2017.He has been calling for more help for Rohingya to launch their own initiatives, for everything from education to arts, but complains there has been no support. “The Rohingya youth are very talented … but nobody sits, nobody talks with them, so their voices have stopped,” says Arfaat.These concerns have risen since August, when Bangladesh responded to a failed attempt to repatriate the Rohingya – for which not a single refugee volunteered – by imposing tighter restrictions on their movement and communication.Arfaat says that, despite the crackdown, UN agencies and international aid groups have not been present.Lack of education has been a particularly pressing concern among Rohingya activists, who have campaigned for years against a government ban on all but the most basic level of schooling, warning of a “lost generation”.They won a victory last month when Bangladesh announced a pilot programme to teach children between 11 and 13 the Myanmar curriculum. Rohingya teachers and activists had little knowledge of how the plan would work, however.The restrictions have been in place since the existing camps were established in 1991, when the same fears about future generations prompted Rohingya who had been educated in Myanmar to set up their own independent learning centres in secret, funded by small monthly contributions from parents.Similar models have become more prevalent since 2017, when the Kutupalong refugee camp became the world’s largest as it absorbed the hundreds of thousands of people who fled a Myanmar military operation described by the UN as having “genocidal intent”.Activist Khin Maung says that despite three decades of Rohingya experience in the refugee camps, their expertise is not tapped by humanitarian workers.He complains that organisations implementing education projects often employ underqualified tutors who teach only basic phrases and nursery rhymes, failing to utilise the talents of refugees.A 2019 study by the Peace Research Institute Oslo said that, despite the barriers imposed on the humanitarian community by the government’s education ban, more could have been done to map out the work carried out by Rohingya themselves.“The humanitarian sector often falls short on centring community voices in this way, which I think is due in part to policy restrictions, limited resources and a lack of flexibility,” says the report’s co-author Jessica Olney.“It’s also due to quick staff turnaround, as many humanitarian staff are new to the Rohingya community and aren’t encouraged or permitted by their agencies to spend time in the camps just talking to people and listening to gain a deep understanding of the context and people’s needs.”The relationship between the Rohingya and the humanitarian community has been strained by a recent government order to stop paying refugee volunteers in cash, which the authorities claim is used to buy false documents. The government has encouraged the hiring of Bangladeshis instead.Refugees claim they have been removed from volunteer roles, which typically pay a daily stipend of less than £3, which forces them to rely solely on the aid supply of oil, lentils and rice.NGOs operating in the area claim “miscommunication” was a reason some Rohingya had been dismissed.“There is a major communication breakdown between some international humanitarian organisations and the Rohingya refugee volunteers about why they are being dismissed,” says John Quinley, human rights specialist for the advocacy group Fortify Rights, which has documented the dismissals.There was a similar outcry by refugees when the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, signed an agreement with Myanmar on repatriating the Rohingya in 2018. Refugees said they were not consulted on that deal, or about a system for biometric registration.A spokesperson for the UNHCR says the agency used several methods to share information with refugees and engage community leaders, including face-to-face meetings, drama performances and podcasts.The spokesperson adds: “The Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar is more than 850,000 people. This alone presents a challenge in terms of ensuring that all voices are heard. Furthermore, to communicate effectively with a very large population requires the utilisation of technology. Currently, this presents challenges in Cox’s Bazar due to restrictions on mobile connectivity.“UNHCR works to ensure that refugees are consulted on key issues and are involved in decision-making processes including through regular protection monitoring and profiling, as well as community outreach. Refugees should be consulted on all issues related to their daily lives and not only significant political developments.”Maung says the role played by refugees in the humanitarian response over the past two years, from volunteering as translators to other key roles, has been underestimated.“They ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can’t do anything in the camps, they can’t even understand us properly. They don’t know our language,” he says. “We are the nuts and bolts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29485a681aece9e0a950b3b283747638d0a8309/0_702_6184_3711/master/6184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfd6d19609445c9ea26fcfdd9c6beb","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

These measures have no place in a modern system of justice.”More than 120,000 people a year are prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee, with five people sent to prison in 2018 for failing to pay fines relating to their cases.The BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, announced last month that he would stand down to allow his successor to conduct negotiations with the government over the amount it can charge for the licence fee – currently set at £154.50 a year – between 2022 and 2027.This could potentially be the last ever licence fee settlement, with many other European countries already moving away from the licence fee model. In Sweden, almost all adults pay a supplementary tax to fund public service broadcasting, regardless of whether they own a television set, with similar measures taking place in other Nordic countries. Other nations have chosen to fund their national broadcasters directly, using government funding.A Netflix-style subscription model has also been proposed, although critics have pointed out it would be near-impossible to password-protect existing television channels, and that Netflix, which is loss-making, does not attempt to provide the universal news service offered by the BBC.Morgan said she was committed to the universal approach of the BBC and its ability to bring together large audiences in one place, suggesting a password-protected subscription was not currently on the cards.“I truly believe that, no matter how well-funded the international streaming giants are, British broadcasters remain essential. Universal availability means the BBC and other public service broadcasters can still create shared moments that bring the country together, be that through sports coverage, major events, great dramas or documentaries,” she said.In response to claims the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster, a spokesperson for the broadcaster said: “The BBC tried to set up a Netflix service a decade ago while they were still sending DVDs in the post, but was prevented from doing so by regulators.“There is a danger that politicians catastrophise the situation. The BBC is the most-used media organisation in the UK. It reaches the most people. It’s used for the most time. You wouldn’t think that from some of the things being said today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44181eae1ba302f9ad24bfc57a5a37d515c678ee/0_115_4239_2543/master/4239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf0fe1378be6a1a8addbfcde7c5afb8b","title":"alices adventures under ground review royal opera gerald barry","story":"Royal Opera House, London The dizzying world of Lewis Carroll is brought to wonderful and touching life, and Gerald Barry’s intense score is marshalled with panache by Thomas AdèsWhen Alice’s Adventures Under Ground received its European premiere at the Barbican three years ago, it seemed more likely to find a permanent home in the concert hall rather than the opera house. Gerald Barry’s gleeful, picaresque romp through Lewis Carroll’s two Alice books seemed to have produced a work that was more cantata than viable, stageable opera – events and characters almost lifted haphazardly from the texts without much sense of a linear narrative and crammed into a score that lasted a breathless 50 minutes. How could any stage production cope with a piece that zigzagged from one scene to another at such dizzying speed?Yet Antony McDonald has succeeded in doing just that in a spectacularly successful way. It was McDonald who first released the full operatic potential of Barry’s whirlwind The Importance of Being Earnest with his 2013 production for Northern Ireland Opera, and he applies the same, unfailingly light touch to his staging of Alice for the Royal Opera, with witty designs and pinpoint stagecraft that never puts a foot wrong. The speed at which everything happens doesn’t appear to faze him: within seconds of the very start, as the White Rabbit announces his lateness, Alice has tumbled down the rabbit hole with a torrent of coloratura arpeggios, and encountered the all-male chorus of four “Drink me” bottles that swiftly transform into “Eat me” cakes.And so it continues. A 19th-century toy theatre provides the frame, and at one point a cardboard cutout of Queen Victoria and her family is whisked across the stage. The four men in the cast of seven become choruses of babies and oysters, as well as taking on solo roles (an average of 10 different parts per singer). Barry’s selection of scenes seems to be weighted slightly towards Carroll’s second book, Through the Looking Glass, with its persistent allusions to chess, though the White Rabbit, the Duchess, the Cook, the King and Queen of Hearts and the Tea Party all appear from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Wherever they’re from, McDonald finds hilariously charming representations for them all, and adds another twist with a trio of dancers (Lukas Hunt, Bianca Hopkins and Eloise Hymas) who represent Carroll himself and the historical Alice’s sisters, Lorina and Edith Liddell.Barry’s music adds its own extra surreal layer, whether it’s the machine-gun delivery of much of the text, the outrageously high soprano writing he inflicts on Alice, or the way in which he seems to embed a whole bundle of musical traditions and references in his score – the use of It’s a Long Way to Tipperary in his setting (in Russian and French) of Jabberwocky Humpty Dumpty’s melancholy appropriation of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy or the strangely touching chorale sung by the White Rabbit to end the opera. Meanwhile, the orchestral writing, marshalled with tremendous panache by Thomas Adès, hurls everything at the audience with manic intensity, whether it’s jagged brass, tipsy, tumbling woodwind lines or the wind machines cranked up in the final moments.The show is double-cast for its short run. Both lineups are uniformly excellent: Claudia Boyle and Jennifer France are the Alices, coping fearlessly with Barry’s outrageous demands on their vocal agility, Boyle marginally more feisty as a stage presence, France perhaps getting more of her words across. It’s almost invidious to pick out other names from either cast in what is such a brilliantly executed ensemble piece, but Hilary Summers is a formidable White Queen and Joshua Bloom a wonderfully lugubrious Humpty, while having Nicky Spence and Robert Murray as the two tenors in the second cast is luxury indeed. It’s altogether wonderfully realised, bringing Barry’s surreal world to life more successfully than anyone could possibly have imagined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81993fdd8b2b80449dc3ccb85de285cfd06c59a/0_182_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=accffafdc1cee092a7c08a09ce1dc14e","title":"us elections the importance of iowa podcast","story":"Chris McGreal visits the first US state to vote in this year’s race for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination.

It stressed that measures are now in place for Super League to block such signings.“The Super League board accepts the legalities around the RFL’s decision to register Israel Folau,” he said, “and the board has voted unanimously to put in place measures that ensure the Super League has greater authority to stop controversial signings such as this in the future. Super League has clearly and consistently outlined its position on Israel Folau.“With the season under way, we now feel it is important for Super League to separate what is an off-field matter from what is happening on the field. As a sport we have an impressive and enviable track record when it comes to equality, ersity and inclusion and we will continue our great work in those areas.”Super League clubs had summoned the Catalans owner, Bernard Guasch, to the meeting, but he was unable to attend due to business issues in France. That meant the club’s general manager, Alex Chan, was present along with a consultant representing the Dragons, but neither they nor any of the other top-flight clubs would expand further upon Super League’s statement.Before the meeting, it was revealed that the Hull KR chairman, Neil Hudgell had written to Catalans warning them of potential legal ramifications should any club or the competition suffer financial damages as a result of the decision to sign Folau. The former Wallaby was sacked by Rugby Australia last May following a series of homophobic social media posts. Hudgell declined to comment further after the meeting in Salford.The former Waratahs full-back or winger has not played any rugby since last April and it is 10 years since his last league match, but the Catalans are short of outside backs and coach Steve McNamara could be tempted to name him in his 21-man squad on Friday.“We knew it would be controversial,” McNamara told BBC Sport. “We investigated a fair few players, Israel’s name was on that list and, having spent a lot of time speaking to him and understanding him a lot more and getting reassurances, we made a decision as a club that we would support Israel and give him another opportunity in our game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a026f572a10d7b42ea9fb62000fae84683bd095/0_436_2845_1707/master/2845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3b7c579b036f21f2f4f428732fc22b6","title":"mookie betts trade dodgers red sox mlb baseball","story":"Banking on Mookie Betts to be the missing piece in their World Series pursuit, the Los Angeles Dodgers finally pulled off a blockbuster deal with the cost-cutting Red Sox.Boston agreed to trade the 2018 AL MVP to the Dodgers on Tuesday night, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, packaging Betts with left-hander David Price in a salary dump designed to save the Red Sox tens of millions of dollars and help them dip below baseball’s luxury tax threshold.The Dodgers, eager for a World Series title after losing in the 2017 and 2018 Fall Classics, are sending outfielder Alex Verdugo to the Red Sox. The deal also involves the Minnesota Twins, who are getting right-hander Kenta Maeda from the Dodgers and sending pitching prospect Brusdar Graterol to Boston. Los Angeles will also get cash from Boston to offset some of the $123m owed to Betts and Price, but the exact amount is not yet known. Betts, who will earn $27m this season, has spurned nine-figure offers from the Red Sox for a long-term deal and expressed eagerness to test the free agent market. Boston decided to move him now rather than let the four-time All-Star walk after the 2020 season.One of baseball’s best all-around talents, Betts should fit nicely into a Dodgers lineup that also includes reigning NL MVP Cody Bellinger. Los Angeles have won seven straight NL West titles but haven’t celebrated a World Series championship since 1988. They fell in 2018 against Betts and the Red Sox, a year after being defeated by the Houston Astros in seven games.Price is due $96m over the final three years of a $217m, seven-year deal he signed before the 2016 season. The 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner missed time last year with a wrist issue and went 7-5 with a 4.28 ERA in 22 starts.The Dodgers finally pulled off the kind of splashy offseason deal that has eluded them in recent years. They lost out on two primary offseason pursuits when pitcher Gerrit Cole signed with the New York Yankees for $324m over nine years and third baseman Anthony Rendon signed a $245m, seven-year contract with the rival Angels. Until now, the Dodgers’ top addition this winter was reliever Blake Treinen.Adding Betts’ bat to a lineup that includes Bellinger, Justin Turner, Max Muncy and Corey Seager makes the Dodgers even more fearsome. Their offense led the National League with 886 runs and 279 home runs last year. Betts’ departure deepens the disappointment in Boston, where the New England Patriots sat out the Super Bowl for the first time in four years and face the prospect of quarterback Tom Brady leaving as a free agent. The Red Sox are now without the best player, the top executive and the manager who led them to a franchise-record 108 wins and the World Series championship a year ago.Owner John Henry said in September, after the team missed the playoffs for the first time since 2015, that the Red Sox “need to be under the CBT.” Team president Sam Kennedy later walked back the comments and said that was “a goal but not a mandate.” After he was hired, Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom said: “The goal remains to be competitive always. 2020 is important. So are 2021, 2022 and beyond.” Undoubtedly, the focus is now on the future.The Red Sox remain without a manager three weeks after firing Alex Cora for his role in the Houston Astros 2017 sign-stealing scandal Major League Baseball has not announced the results of its investigation into whether Cora implemented a similar scheme when he took over in Boston in 2018.

Detailed talks about the World Cup, a biennial event which does not resonate deeply within the sport, have been ongoing for a number of months. The plan would see the competition’s purse boosted from $7m to upwards of $10m, with female golfers entering the fold seen as commercially beneficial.A bigger prize fund would, of course, be welcomed by male participants, but it would make a more significant impact on the female game as players look to close the pay gap between themselves and members of the PGA Tour in particular.The US-based LPGA Tour announced what was essentially a takeover of the Ladies European Tour in late 2019. Improvements to the women’s schedule in Europe that followed were widely heralded.Origin Sports Group, where the multi-millionaire Sir Keith Mills is a director, has been integral to the World Cup project. Australia was the recent host of the November event, but even its place in the golfing calendar may be subject to change, with venues in Europe and the Middle East expressing interest in the World Cup under a fresh guise.Nothing is expected to be in place by the time the World Cup tees off later this year – with Thomas Pieters and Thomas Detry to defend the trophy on behalf of Belgium – but alterations for 2022 are entirely plausible.Origin declined to comment on its involvement when contacted by the , beyond confirming: “The PGA Tour is working on a variety of options to potentially relaunch the World Cup of Golf and we’ve been in touch with them on several concepts.” A spokesman for the PGA Tour would not reference the World Cup directly but said: “We’ve looked at new ways to promote the game of golf through new formats and certainly an event that would include PGA Tour and LPGA players is something that we will continue to explore.”In 2016, the PGA and LPGA Tours announced a strategic alliance that pointed heavily towards the introduction of joint events. This June, the European Tour and Ladies European Tour will join up to stage a mixed tournament in Sweden. This competition, hosted by major champions Annika Sorenstam and Henrik Stenson, will see professional men and women going head-to-head on the same course for a single prize and trophy.Yet a revolution at the World Cup, which unlike many other sports doesn’t routinely feature as a key ambition of players, would be the most significant competitive advancement yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3288efa5fdd20916813125d33f4e547555be8d2d/0_252_7167_4300/master/7167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fddac75784608a28d248420789fb329","title":"jessica hynes interview far away","story":"Taking a break from goofy sitcoms, the actor is sounding the climate-crisis alarm in Caryl Churchill’s Far Away.

Violence seeps into the everyday as secrets and lies amass, and by the end of the play, every sentient being on Earth is engaged in conflict. “It’s artful and stylistic in some ways,” says Hynes of Churchill’s writing, “but also incredibly natural and almost perfunctory, even though what is really going on is shocking.”Hynes plays Joan’s morally woozy aunt, Harper, who disguises human screams as owl’s shrieks and piles up lies to hide the bloodstains. “Everyone thinks they’re the good guy,” Hynes says of the character’s morality. “Everyone believes that what they’re doing is for the right reasons.” In a 2016 interview, Hynes said the trait she most deplored in others was dishonesty in Harper, she has a character whose natural state is to lie. “It’s more complicated than honesty or dishonesty,” she says. “I’m trying to find her humanity, even when it feels like inhumanity.”Though never ascribed to a particular struggle, Churchill wrote the play in 2000, at the time of the Serbian conflict. “But its brilliance is in the fact that you could take it anywhere,” Hynes says. “It could be 2,000 years in the future or 1,000 years in the past.”This production draws out the focus on the environment, with the war on nature bought to the fore. Plants and animals are weaponised and ided the ants side with the Moroccans and the weather joins the fight of the Japanese. It is both a rage against inaction and a shrug against the inevitability of violence stemming from an uncaring, eco-damaging capitalist system. “Normal people are never really the perpetrators,” Hynes figures. “They are the victims of circumstance, of the wider chaos of war.”Hynes is best known for her comedy, so it feels strange to sit with her and talk earnestly about destruction. Though there is absurdity in Far Away, both in the language (“The cats have come in on the side of the French”) and the action (in the infamous parade scene), the show is not played for laughs. “We’re trying to honour the script completely,” she says, “and do something that feels as faithful and truthful and open as we can make it.”Harper begins the play by talking about how beautiful the owls are outside her windows, but fast-forward a few years and she sees violence in every wing of a bird or blade of grass. As audience members, we skip the distance between these viewpoints. “We talked about what might have happened in that middle act,” Hynes explains, “to make that slowly encroaching ravaged landscape, with more grief, more loss, more violence, more struggle.” In the first scene, director Lyndsey Turner has Harper weaving a quilt of a natural landscape, building up an image of what is beginning to break down around them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b44615c122e821e84ede767a88d2ed018cfd0c9/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3ecfea4c5018cebd8c2a0f8644155b","title":"the rise of facial recognition technology podcast","story":"Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the politan police in London.

Immediately after the initial numbers were released, the 38-year-old gay candidate declared it an “astonishing victory” for a campaign that has already defied long odds.“A campaign that started a year ago with four staff members, no name recognition, no money – just a big idea – a campaign that some said should have no business even making this attempt, has taken its place at the front of this race to replace the president with a better vision,” Buttigieg said at a campaign event in Laconia, New Hampshire.In a rare display of emotion, Buttigieg said the result “validates for a kid, somewhere in a community, wondering if he belongs, where she belongs, or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there’s a lot backing up that belief”.The Sanders campaign was quick to point to the raw vote count as evidence of the senator’s ability to excite Democratic voters.Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser for Sanders’ campaign, said in a statement: “So far it’s clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field.”It was a blow for Biden, however, who has led the field in national polling since he entered the race and campaigned on his perceived electability. Biden’s campaign objected to the party’s decision to release the partial results.By all accounts, Iowa Democrats were determined to support a candidate who they believe could defeat Donald Trump in the election in November. The caucuses offered a first glimpse of who voters believe is best suited to do that.In Iowa on Monday night, a mobile app meant to help steer organizers through the complicated caucus process and help them report results turned out to be defective.As the hours dragged on without an announced result, leading contenders in the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates claimed success while minor candidates saw no reason to drop out.“The reporting of the results and circumstances surrounding the 2020 Iowa Democratic party caucuses were unacceptable,” said Price. “As the chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this.”But Price insisted the data was “accurate” and “secure” and vowed a “thorough, transparent and independent examination” would follow.Part of the issue on Monday night was a decision by the state party to release four sets of data from the caucuses in response to complaints over transparency by the Sanders campaign in 2016, when Hillary Clinton defeated him in the state delegate count by a quarter of a percentage point.Meanwhile, Democratic officials in Nevada sought to mitigate concerns ahead of the states caucuses on 22 February, announcing that the party would not use the same app or vendor.But the confusion and chaos engulfing the process may yet overshadow the results as attention turns to New Hampshire, which holds the next nominating contest on 11 February.On Monday night after Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Biden sought to turn the confusion to their advantage, delivering bold speeches that touted their strong performances in Iowa without a clear sense of who was in pole position.The president wasted little time in crowing over his opponents’ predicament, tweeting on Tuesday morning: “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country … the only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ‘Trump’.”Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, did not compete in Iowa but on Tuesday announced that he would double the fortune he’s already spending on national television advertising and expand his sprawling staff.Bypassing the early-voting states, Bloomberg is pursuing a highly unconventional approach to the party’s nomination that involves massive ad spending and a focus on the delegate-rich states that hold contests in March.“Iowa is supposed to be the place lots of candidates go to die,” the Democratic strategist Jim Messina, campaign manager for Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

Fourteen months ago the FDP walked out of federal coalition talks with the CDU and the Greens, citing red lines and compromised principles.While the ballot in the Thuringian parliament is anonymous, Kemmerich’s victory could have only been made possible with votes from the AfD, whose own candidate in the third round gained zero votes.The AfD’s branch in Thuringia is dominated by the party’s aggressively nationalist wing. Last September, a court ruled that the AfD’s state leader, Björn Höcke, could legally be termed a fascist, saying such a designation “rests on verifiable fact”.Coming at a time at which traditional conservatives in Merkel’s party are agitating for a more relaxed approach to cooperating with the far right while CDU centrists are eyeing up a future coalition with the Greens, the Thuringia upset could mark a watershed moment.Alternative für Deutschland’s co-leader Alexander Gauland hailed the outcome as a sign that “excluding the AfD is no longer an option”, while Alexander Mitsch of the CDU’s hardline WerteUnion pressure group said it showed that his party “can be successful without the SPD and the Greens”.Mike Mohring, who heads the Christian Democratic Union in Thuringia, insisted the result did not amount to an informal coalition with the far-right, arguing that his party “is not responsible for the voting behaviour of other parties”.The outcome drew wide condemnation not just from Die Linke, whose Thuringia branch is considered one of the most pragmatic within the party that grew out of East Germany’s Socialist Unity Party.Susanne Hennig-Wellsow, the leftwing party’s state leader, threw a bunch of flowers down at Kemmerich’s feet and declined to shake the shock victor’s hands. She told German media that Wednesday’s events had been “long in the making”.“How far have we come that the FDP allows a state premier Kemmerich to be voted in with votes from the fascist Höcke and the AfD?”, said Die Linke’s co-chair Bernd Riexinger. “Breaking this taboo will have far-reaching consequences”.“The events in Thuringia are an inexcusable breach of the firewall”, tweeted the co-leader of the SPD, Norbert Walter-Borjans. “For the ‘liberals’ to become the straw man for the extreme right’s power grab is a scandal of the highest order”.Neither the chancellor, Angela Merkel, or the CDU’s chair, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, have so far commented on events in the state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bdadceab613b2fb4de3744879f65eb24fd2219/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ab88acc6578476a219950d6f0d6dbc6","title":"conor murphy paul quinn comments calls for sinn fein minister to be sacked","story":"Conor Murphy previously said 21-year-old brutally killed in 2007 had been a criminalA notorious murder allegedly committed by the IRA has returned to haunt Sinn Féin just as it appears poised for a historic breakthrough in Ireland’s general election on Saturday.Mary Lou McDonald, the republican party’s leader, was forced on the defensive on Wednesday as the campaign unexpectedly swerved towards the 2007 killing of Paul Quinn, forcing McDonald to revisit the party’s links with the IRA.McDonald faced calls to sack Conor Murphy, a Sinn Féin minister for finance in the Stormont government, over comments he previously made claiming the victim was a criminal.On 20 October 2007, up to 10 men beat Quinn with iron and nail-studded bars, breaking every major bone in his body. It was one of the most brutal murders allegedly involving IRA members since the Good Friday agreement.The attack, in a cowshed near Castleblayney in county Monaghan on Ireland’s border with Northern Ireland, left the 21-year-old victim resembling a “lump of jelly”, a Garda officer said at the time.Quinn’s family said the local IRA killed him because he had got the better of the son of a local republican in a fist fight. Sinn Féin denied any IRA involvement.McDonald stumbled in an RTE television debate on Tuesday night when a moderator asked her to explain contradictory statements about the atrocity.McDonald, usually a polished media performer, appeared flummoxed and ended up calling on Murphy, her party colleague, to apologise to Quinn’s family.Since succeeding Gerry Adams as party leader, McDonald, a Dubliner with no paramilitary links, has made Sinn Féin more palatable to Irish voters previously alienated by its role in Northern Ireland’s Troubles.The intrusion of Quinn’s murder into the campaign has raised awkward questions and erted focus from its preferred topics of housing and health.The victim’s parents, Breege and Stephen, have long campaigned for Sinn Féin to help police catch the killers, who remain free. They have also demanded that Murphy, who is currently finance minister in the government at Stormont, retract his allegation, made in a BBC interview weeks after the murder, that their son was a criminal. “Paul Quinn was involved in smuggling and criminality and I think everyone accepts that,” he said.In an RTE radio interview on Monday, McDonald suggested Murphy had made no such allegation. Confronted with Murphy’s quote in the televised debate on Tuesday, McDonald said her recollection of what he had said was faulty and that he would apologise. “Those things should not have been said.”The story gathered steam on Wednesday with the Quinn family giving further interviews. McDonald’s rivals followed up. “This mother is still grieving … she’s looking for answers, for truth, for justice. I believe that she is entitled to that,” said Varadkar.Martin, the Fianna Fáil leader, said it was “extraordinary” that it took Sinn Féin 13 years to apologise.Asked if she would ask Murphy to step down as finance minister, McDonald said: “Absolutely not.” Her party colleague hoped to meet the family to apologise in person, she said.“That’s the right thing to do, it’s the decent thing to do. That family have been through a horrible ordeal, I mean I can’t even imagine, to lose their son in such a brutal way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b27fb7384bc85c2d9b99318cdbeb3c7ef618c80/146_0_1182_709/master/1182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776c5439715460ad24d413b4f27a05be","title":"diary of a coronavirus evacuee everyones trying to avoid contact with each other","story":"Australian Daniel Ou Yang, 21, was on the Air New Zealand flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland. Here he writes about the stress of his evacuationAt 2.52pm, we arrived at Wuhan Tianjin airport.The drive here was smooth, all the big wide roads with no cars on them. We made it through the checkpoints and arrived within an hour.I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house, they were holding back tears. My dad sent me into the airport. After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I’ll look after myself from there on.There were a lot of us evacuating, with two orthree other countries including us. Everyone’s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport.I found myself a quiet spot, and talked to my family and friends on my phone until we started lining up to get our boarding pass.At 4.30pm they told us after getting our boarding pass to wait for the security clearance to be opened, but to line up first because they’ll be a lot of different countries evacuating at once all through one entrance.It wasn’t until around 9.30pm that they started processing everyone. Our flight was due to leave at 11pm.I originally lined up behind everyone, again nervous of the close proximity. As it reached 10pm, I saw a lot of Chinese rushing to the front, and I was encouraged to join them, so I did. They were all going on the same Auckland flight as me, so we were allowed to cut the queue to be processed first.I felt a bit guilty, all these foreigners looking at us cutting the line, maybe they will think that we are getting special treatment because we are Chinese.There was this lady with her two young kids also evacuating and they were running late. I waited for them to bring them with me through the security. From there everyone was wearing full hazmat suits.It took us an hour to finally get through to immigration and the last security check point before our flight gate 334. It was already 11.10pm.I got through but the lady was stopped because she had ice skating shoes in the carry on which weren’t allowed. I told her to just leave them, but she was unwilling to. In the end, it was 11.20pm and I said I needed to go make the flight and I’ll tell them to wait for her and her kids.It was a huge rush and I thought I missed it because there was no one at the gate. But I made it just in time. I was on the phone to the embassy letting them know about the lady and kids. I hope they made it on.The flight itself wasn’t too bad, but we were delayed so didn’t leave until 1am.After having a really late dinner (or early breakfast) I fell asleep very quickly. Luckily there was a spare seat next to me so I sat next to the window and a girl sat on the other end, leaving plenty of space for each other.We were supplied with masks and hand sanitisers along with the normal flight care package. I woke up at 10 and went to the bathroom. We were encouraged to leave our seat as little as possible so I was hesitant.Used a lot of hand sanitisers throughout the flight along with everyone else. Everyone is just trying to avoid contact with each other as much as possible and constantly using hand sanitisers.We’ve arrived at New Zealand now. I have to prepare myself for another long flight back to Christmas Island, a huge detour. I’m nervous about being there.I heard from others there’s barely any wifi and no reception. There is nothing to do. Hopefully the facility is clean, and I can be out of there smoothly. I will want to try and keep everyone updated, but with the lack of reception and wifi, I think it’ll be very limited.I just want to get back home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161767.1580841151!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll it s not always the economy stupid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy during Fine Gael’s election manifesto launch in City Assembly House, Dublin.   Photograph :Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe natural order of politics in Ireland – either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil on top – has been upset only once before at a time of economic crisis – in 2010 voters lost faith in the two main parties and Labour surged to 33 per cent in our September poll of that year. What is intriguing about this latest upset is that it has happened without any obvious crisis or catalyst, such as an economic downturn or political scandal. There has also been a curious collapse in the Government’s satisfaction rating. As recently as October last year, 42 per cent of voters were satisfied with how the Government was running the country. Yet just a few months later this satisfaction rating has halved, down to just 21 per cent in this latest poll.An explanation is needed for this sudden and precipitous decline in Government satisfaction.For an answer we need look no further than health and housing. When voters were asked to give their view on what should be the priority for an incoming taoiseach, health (42 per cent) and housing (34 per cent) dominated. Challenges in health and housing are, arguably, generational and global, with no quick-fix solutions. Yet frustration with what voters see as a lack of progress has spilled over into this election, crowding out the Government’s achievements in other areas. The mood of voters has changed, even if the facts have not.What has facilitated this change of mood is the performance of our economy. Turn the clock back five years and the two most pressing issues for voters were jobs and the economy. The recovery has meant that jobs and the economy have taken a back seat, allowing health and housing to move front and centre.A growing economy has also given us permission to think less about how wealth is created and more about how wealth is shared. A majority of voters in our latest poll would like to see either most (18 per cent) or a little (52 per cent) of the surplus generated by a strong economy devoted to reducing taxes. About one in four (27 per cent) would not like to see any reduction. Surplus resourcesOpinion regarding whether surplus resources should be used to reduce taxes varies by party. At one end of the spectrum are Green voters, of whom only 48 per cent would like to see taxes reduced. At the other end are Sinn Féin voters, of whom three in four (75 per cent) are in favour of lowering taxes.The RIC commemoration has also emerged as an issue during this campaign. The decision to postpone is endorsed by a majority (68 per cent) of voters generally, and by a majority of supporters of each of the main parties.It has long been held that elections are won or lost on the economy. Whatever the outcome of the election on Saturday, this piece of conventional wisdom has been severely dented by the findings of this latest Ipsos MRBI poll. The main party of Government, Fine Gael, has received no electoral idend from having overseen a recovery in the economy, nor have Fianna Fáil for their role in supporting the Government.

Photograph: Eamon Ward for The This sudden capture of the public mood breathed life and momentum into his campaign, transforming him from a dark horse, into a candidate with a realistic chance of topping the poll.All this has not been lost on the local Fianna Fáil organisation in Co Clare. Cllr Crowe had 14 party stalwarts and friends with him when he canvassed Miltown Malbay recently, one of four separate canvassing teams working for him in the county that day.Miltown Malbay has been hit hard by the recession. It has a long and proud history as a market town, but its main street is littered with shuttered businesses and its local population is hungry for change.It was also the scene of a notorious RIC atrocity. On September 22nd, 1920, a combined force of RIC and Black and Tans burned out 16 homes and businesses in Miltown Malbay and the surrounding towns, killing five people.Cllr Crowe might have been forgiven for assuming that he was on friendly territory in Miltown Malbay. However, as he finished his first circuit of the main street, he was met by a man shouting, “Am I any less of an Irish man than you?”.The man, who declined to be identified, said he was the grandson of an RIC officer and that Cllr Crowe had stirred up ision and animosity to serve his own political agenda.Cllr Crowe declined to speak with the man, leaving him to a member of his canvassing team, but he later said that he would be happy to commemorate any inidual RIC officer, but not the organisation itself.“I would gladly commemorate any inidual who was a serving member of the RIC, if he was an upstanding police man, as an awful lot of them were. I would gladly commemorate them, but I am not for whitewashing an organisation whose sole purpose was to subvert Ireland’s aspirations to be a free country.Cllr Crowe received a positive reaction from the majority on the streets of Miltown Malbay, but the common refrain from locals was that rural Ireland is dying and recent governments have done nothing about it.“Our great town is closed down. We have no industry in the west. We had three factories here in the 1970s and 1980s and its all gone,” said local man, Joe Cullen. “Our town is dead. I think they should have two elections, they should elect a government for Dublin and a government for the west. We’re the forgotten people.”Marie Fox runs An Siopa Beag on Main Street in Miltown Malbay. She has little hope that the current crop of politicians will deliver a future for rural Ireland.“Miltown is struggling. It’s a pity because we have a big population around us. VAT is a big issue, that’s something that the government can control, and rates on country premises should be pro rata with your income,” she said.“Our rates need to be adjusted downwards big-time. How could anyone open a business in a country area the way things are. There has been no investment in the west, we have no employment and no industry other than tourism.“We’ve had a lot of candidates into the shop this week but we’ve seen it all before. I think people are very apathetic. It’s another day and another face. We have 15 people running here in Clare and I don’t know one who would impress me over any of the others.“I will vote. There is always hope, but if it’s anything like the past four years there is nothing in it for rural Ireland.”According to Cllr Crowe, the creation of factories across towns in rural Ireland is no longer realistic, but action should be taken to make rural towns viable for the future.“It’s not about having employment in every crossroad in rural Ireland, that is not realistic. But it is about creating a place where the local school isn’t fighting to stay open, the post office isn’t facing closure, there are guards doing patrols and there is a vibrant community at weekends and evenings,” he said.“Fianna Fáil are looking at developing a special unit in the IDA focused on rural investment. We need to help start-up businesses in rural Ireland, so that all development is not focused on one part of the country."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4162393.1580893975!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 tv debate mcdonald s stumble was key moment","story":"Mary Lou McDonald is questioned over comments made by Sinn Féin\u0027s Conor Murphy, finance minister in Stormont, over the 2007 murder of Paul Quinn.

Photograph: EPANiall CarsonUp until the final minutes of the last debate between the main party leaders, there had been no decisive moment that had the potential to change the dynamic of the election campaign.Leo Varadkar, Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald had traded blows and insults, yet there was nothing that would stick in the memory or follow through to the final days of Election 2020.Then, almost 90 minutes in, moderator Miriam O’Callaghan raised the murder of Paul Quinn, the 21-year-old from Cullyhanna, Co Armagh, who was brutally killed on October 20th 2007.Paul’s mother Breege has in recent days raised comments made around that time by Conor Murphy, Sinn Féin’s finance minister in Stormont, and one of the most senior figures in the organisation.“He came out publicly and called Paul a criminal on national television,” Mrs Quinn said this week of Murphy.This was put to McDonald in an interview with RTÉ’s Bryan Dobson on Monday, and she responded that she did not think one of her key lieutenants had made such comments.Prime Time had found the exact quote and read it back to McDonald.Murphy said in 2007: “Paul Quinn was involved in smuggling and criminality. I think everyone accepts that.”O’Callaghan read this to McDonald, who replied that she remembered “Conor being not quite as direct on that matter.” She was visibly shaken, adding: “Those things should not have been said.”ModeratedWith Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael both trying to halt Sinn Féin’s momentum, it was a big moment.In the final few minutes, the Sinn Féin leader, perhaps rattled, also came unstuck on her party’s climate change policies. “Massive means ambitious and substantial,” she said when pressed for specifics at one point.She had earlier taken the scenic route to dealing with the question of whether she supports the Special Criminal Court: dealing with it, but not actually answering.“I support the courts,” she said, while also repeating her view that the Special Criminal Court needed to be reviewed. “I believe that we need special powers.”The Dublin Central TD was a late entrant to what was initially supposed to be a head-to-head between Martin and Varadkar, with RTÉ changing its position because of Sinn Féin’s surging poll figures.It was well moderated by O’Callaghan and David McCullagh, who gave the leaders of the three parties time and space to answer questions and set out their positions.Point scoringMcDonald was strong at some points, such as explaining her party’s position on a wealth tax, and weaker on others, such as her attempts to explain how Sinn Féin will build 100,000 new homes.But she performed well on other housing issues, clearly outlining why her party thinks a rent freeze is a good idea, and once more stitching Varadkar and Martin together.“These two men have been in government for the last four years,” she said.This week’s Ipsos MRBI opinion poll had Sinn Féin on 25 per cent support, followed by Fianna Fáil on 23 per cent and Fine Gael on 20 per cent.Varadkar, perhaps conscious that he was starting from behind, opened his debate performance by attacking both Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin but a rushed delivery belied his nerves.He improved as the debate progressed and tried to make the Fine Gael argument that “all change isn’t for the better”, instancing Brexit and the election of Donald Trump.He was also successful in asking McDonald about the rates of homelessness, health outcomes and other issues in Northern Ireland, causing her to fall back and blame London and the Tories.As in previous debates, Varadkar tried to hammer home his message that only Fine Gael can be trusted with the economy. He also tried wanly to raise Brexit, perhaps knowing that it has been a non issue throughout the campaign.On health, another strong point was when he admitted that no-one really knows for sure when waiting lists will be cleared and his party was wrong to make promises on that front before.‘Mansplain’Martin was the butt of probably the two best lines of the night – one from Varadkar saying bringing him back to power would be like bringing John Delaney back to run the FAI, and the other from McDonald asking if he was going to “mansplain” corporation tax to her – but he put in a competent and assured performance.He spoke with empathy on the issue of housing, claiming – as his party does - that Fine Gael left too much to the market to figure out as the crisis worsened in recent years.He also performed as someone confident in himself as the campaign draws to a close, and landed a hit on Varadkar by reminding the Taoiseach that he once said bringing more beds into the health system would ease pressure on staff and decrease productivity.Martin’s attacks on Sinn Féin – that it “magicked up the figures” in its manifesto – also stung and his performance was calmer and more considered than previous debates. He also turned what was a weakness – a confused policy on a rent freeze - into a strength, by saying he would not be making unrealisable promises before entering government.Both he and Varadkar were evenly matched throughout, although Varadkar probably pulled ahead as the night drew to a close.Martin stumbled on who in his party had EU experience, citing himself, Éamon Ó Cuív and Brendan Smith. Varadkar was the strongest overall but went much of the night without landing the decisive blow that he needed.Yet the moment when McDonald was told exactly what Conor Murphy had said about Paul Quinn is what will be remembered. Whether it halts Sinn Féin momentum and alters the course of the campaign is another matter.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161803.1580842451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll health and housing most important issues for voters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUrban voters and younger voters are more concerned with housing, while rural voters and older voters give health a higher priority.  Photograph: Getty ImagesHealth and housing remain the voters’ most important issues, with the economy, climate change and Brexit barely registering when they are asked what should be the priority for the next government, according to the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.However, voters also want the next government to reduce taxes if it has resources to spare, with almost a fifth of voters (18 per cent) saying they want most available resources to be used to reduce taxes and 52 per cent preferring “a little” of the available resources to be used for that purpose. Some 27 per cent of respondents do not wish to see taxes reduced at all. The poll was taken on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week among 1,200 respondents in every constituency. The margin of error is estimated at 2.8 per cent.The results confirm the dominant issues of the campaign as health and housing, and suggest that voters expect action on these fronts by the next government. Asked to pick one from a list of issues, 42 per cent of respondents said that health was the issue that should be a priority for the incoming taoiseach, with 34 per cent nominating housing. Just 12 per cent said the economy should be the priority issue, while 6 per cent said climate change and 3 per cent said Brexit.Urban voters and younger voters are more concerned with housing, while rural voters and older voters give health a higher priority. Housing is the number one priority for almost half of voters in Dublin (49 per cent), while concern declines outside the capital. In the rest of Leinster (47 per cent), Munster (49 per cent) and Connacht-Ulster (47 per cent), voters say health should be the number one priority for the next government. DivisionThere is also a ision between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voters and the supporters of other parties on the housing issue. While just a quarter of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail voters say housing should be the number one priority for the next government, the number rises sharply among voters from the other parties – to 45 per cent of Sinn Féin voters and 46 per cent of Labour voters. Voters were also asked what the next government should do if it has resources to spare – use most of it to reduce taxes, use a little to reduce taxes or not reduce taxes at all.A large majority are in favour of some tax cuts – 70 per cent say that the government should use either most or a little of the extra resources for this purpose. However, by far the greater portion are in favour of minor tax cuts – 52 per cent say the government should use a little of the extra resources to reduce taxes, with 18 per cent saying most of the available resources should be used for this purpose.Perhaps surprisingly, the party most in favour of using most of the available resources to reduce taxes was Sinn Féin – 26 per cent of its voters choosing this option.

The gay, half Indian medical doctor was the changing face of modern Ireland.A year after taking office he oversaw the abolition of strict abortion laws and on the international stage he bravely stood up to the British over Brexit. All the while, the economy boomed.But as Ireland heads towards an election this Saturday the 41-year-old progressive -  often mentioned in the same breath as Justin Trudeau in Canada, Emmanuel Macron in France and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand - is facing defeat.While success on the international stage has won him plaudits, critics at home claim that Mr Varadkar has become arrogant, aloof and not interested in key domestic issues, like healthcare and housing.In Dublin’ cranes swing overhead and the streets are clogged by the movement of hundreds of construction workers employed at what is supposed to be Ireland\u0027s state-of-the-art National Children’s Hospital.Part of a key pledge by Mr Varadkar\u0027s Fine Gael party to fix Ireland\u0027s broken healthcare system, the facility was supposed to open this year for a cost of €650 million.Three years behind schedule and with costs spiralling into the billions, the hospital is one of the reasons that the sheen has come off Mr Varadkar’s premiership.The debacle at the National Children’s Hospital is symptomatic of chaos across the healthcare sector.Hospital waiting lists have reached record levels. There is also a chronic shortage of housing. Young people are unable to get on the housing ladder and quite often cannot afford spiralling rents in Dublin and other cities.Homelessness has also become a major campaign issue. Last year, a photo of a young boy eating his evening meal on a pedestrianised shopping street in the centre of Dublin captured the human cost of the unfolding crisis.In the working class area around the proposed children’s hospital, there is anger at the escalating cost of the project.Maureen O’Mahony, 74, says her main concerns are “jobs for my grandchildren and somewhere they can live”. She used to vote for the Labour Party, but on Saturday she is thinking of going with Sinn Fein or the hard Left.Maureen\u0027s wider constituency is rapidly gentrifying. Cian O’Riordan, 28, a computer science graduate who works in an IT start-up in the area should be the young millennial that fits the mould as a Varadkar voter.Angry about being squeezed out of the housing market by rapidly rising prices, he says he hasn’t made up his mind yet what way he will vote - except that it definitely won’t be for Fine Gael.It has become a rubric of all elections that they are won or lost based on the state of the economy. This is clearly not the case in Ireland.When Fine Gael came to power in 2011 Ireland was in an EU-IMF bailout programme following a spectacular property market crash unemployment was more than 15 per cent, and the national debt had ballooned from 25 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 123 per cent in the space of four years. Also, in 2011, the budget deficit hit 32 per cent of GDP following the rescue of the banking system.Ireland has been the fastest growing economy in the EU for the past six years. Unemployment is at a thirteen year low of 4.8 per cent, national debt is 63.6 per cent of GDP and there was a budget surplus of just under 1 per cent for last year.Mr Varadkar’s handling of Brexit negotiations helped push his popularity to record levels. His implacable resistance to any border on the island of Ireland risked becoming the gordian knot of talks to secure a Withdrawal Agreement. In the end he prevailed.But the Withdrawal Bill was agreed last October. If a week is a long time in politics, then three months is an eternity.Fine Gael traditionally draws its support from urban middle class voters and farmers. But its appeal to these voters has ebbed in recent months. The failure to roll out broadband has provoked a backlash from rural Ireland. The government has also clashed with farmers over beef prices. And even the middle classes are not immune to problems in the housing and health sectors.“On paper the Fine Gael-led Government has done well on key economic indicators,” Eoin O’Malley, professor of politics at Dublin City University, says. “But people have greater expectations of government now, and the housing policy has failed - or it has not succeeded quickly enough. The rent crisis is real and felt by a whole generation.” Mr O’Malley says the other problem for Fine Gael is that it’s been in government for nine years.In a poll released on Monday, Fine Gael was in third place on a rating of 20 per cent, behind Fianna Fail on 23 per cent and Sinn Fein on 25 per cent. If these support levels pan out on election day, then Fine Gael faces a meltdown at the polls.Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have given Sinn Fein a boost, in part by cosying up to other parties such as the Greens as potential coalition partners, Mr O’Malley says. “They’ve taken the edginess off the Greens, and so a vote for other ‘protest’ parties doesn’t look like change, only Sinn Fein does. So I’m not sure we can say Sinn Fein has run a terribly good election, it just became the party to vote for if you are sick of the other lot.”Unless Fine Gael has a Lazarus type recovery in the final days of the campaign before voters go to the polls on Saturday, then Leo Varadkar will be heading to the opposition benches. That is unless Fianna Fail and Fine Gael set aside their historical enmities and form a grand coalition for the first time in the history of the state.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charts show us politics polarised record levels","story":"US politics is at one of its most polarised points in modern history, according to recent polling, with Democrats and Republicans refusing to see eye-to-eye on many of the country’s key issues.Polling from Pew Research, dating back to 1994, shows that Democrats and Republicans have been starkly ided since 2014. This was on display in the House of Representatives just this week, with Democratic House Speaker ripping up a copy of President Trump’s State of the Union address after he refused to shake her outstretched hand.Today’s acrimony comes in contrast to the 1990s and 2000s, when data shows that Republicans and Democrats stayed closely aligned to each other, with both parties moving towards the left or right at the same time. This changed between 2011 and 2014. With Barack Obama as President, the Democratic Party shifted to the left while Republicans turned right – forming the deep ide we see today. The Pew Research Centre has found partisanship among the most politically-engaged soared under Barack Obama’s presidency and has only widened since Donald Trump took office.In areas such as government, race, immigration, national security and environmental protection – all of which are measured to give the scores in the chart below – the ide between Democrats and Republicans has reached record levels.In the six years to 2017, the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying the government should do more to help the needy, even if it means going deeper into debt, rose 17 percentage points – from 54 to 71 per cent.Meanwhile the attitude of Republicans and independents who lean Republican has barely shifted, from 25 per cent to 24 percent.A concerted shift from Democrats toward ending racial discrimination has opened up the widest partisan ide on the issue for decades. 81 per cent of Democrats and independents who lean toward Democrats now say the country needs to continue making advancements for equal rights – a 45 point gap over Republicans at 36 per cent.Equally, the share of Democrats who say immigrants strengthen the country has increased from 32 per cent in 1994 to 84 per cent in 2017 – a decidedly liberal shift. Republicans have also shifted to a more liberal view on immigration but far less markedly, with 42 per cent saying immigrants strengthen the country (up from 30 per cent in 1994).The difference in support for impeachment between Republicans and Democrats is stark.While over four in five Democrats (84.5 per cent) support removing Trump from office, fewer than one in 10 Republicans back it (9.2 per cent), according to the latest 538 polling average. These two tribes have become entrenched since the House of Representatives backed impeachment on 18 December, with Democratic support for Trump’s removal increasing an extra 2.8 percentage points – compared to the Republicans’ shift of one percentage point.Such stark differences in opinion have helped drive the congressional showdown in Trump’s impeachment trial, with Republican senators refusing to back Democrats’ call for witnesses. Republican commitment to Trump made the President’s acquittal all but certain.Meanwhile, the American public is stuck between the two polarised parties, with support for impeachment standing at 47.9 per cent on 4 February.With the impeachment trial’s end, Trump strategists will now be concentrating on the path to 2020 re-election. They will aim to repeat the success of 2016, where Trump was able to win the presidential election despite Hillary Clinton gaining more votes than him.Approval ratings give us a clue as to how this message will work. Despite Trump having an overall negative approval rating, the gap in support between Republicans and Democrats is the widest it has ever been during Trump’s presidency.With 94 per cent of Republicans and seven per cent of Democrats giving the president positive approval ratings, the partisan split of 87 percentage points is the largest since January 2017.The President’s State of the Union address showed how Donald Trump will once again appeal to his most loyal followers, ignoring Democratic voters already locked into their own partisan preference. His rhetoric pushed an economic “blue collar boom”, hailing the “great American comeback”.Such messages are squarely aimed at Trump’s 2016 voters – a coalition of traditional economically-conservative Republicans and socially-conservative blue collar workers – proving that Trump is confident that, once again, his base can push him over the line.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"far complacent islamist extremism","story":"Truly committed Islamist terrorists like Sudesh Amman remain a threat even after they have been brought to justiceThe judicial system needs to wise up to prevent the premature release of unrepentant terroristsBritain has been waging a war against Islamist extremists for the better part of two decades. Yet, to judge by the latest terrorist attack to take place in broad daylight on a British street, those responsible for tackling Islamist extremism are still struggling to devise an effective formula for dealing with would-be jihadis.For all the talk we have heard from successive prime ministers, from Tony Blair to Theresa May, about getting tough with those responsible for plotting and carrying out acts of Islamist-inspired terrorism, the fact that London has just suffered its second attack by a convicted terrorist in two months suggests that we are a long way from having measures in place to prevent further carnage.True, it is hard to know for sure whether someone who has previously been convicted of terrorism is intent on committing further crimes after being released from prison or is seriously interested in mending their ways. That certainly appeared to be the case with Usman Khan, who managed to persuade British officials he was interested in ditching his allegiance to militant Islam, only to launch a frenzied attack on London Bridge last November, killing two people and stabbing three others before he was shot dead by police marksmen.There were no such reservations in the case of Sudesh Amman, who, following his release from Belmarsh prison at the end of last month, was deemed to be so dangerous that his movements were closely monitored by a specialist counter-terrorism police unit.Amman, who was jailed for three years and four months at the Old Bailey in November 2018, after pleading guilty to numerous terrorist offences, was released after serving just half of his sentence, even though he did not display the slightest hint of remorse for his crimes.It was for this reason, and the fact that he remained utterly committed to the Islamist cause, that Amman was placed under surveillance from the moment he was released. But not even this sensible precaution could prevent Amman from attacking two innocent bystanders in Streatham, south London, on Sunday before, like Khan before him, he was shot dead by police marksmen.The ease with which committed terrorists like Khan and Amman have been able to play the system in such a way that they have been able to go on to commit more serious acts of terrorism than those that led to their incarceration raises serious questions about its effectiveness.Richard Walton, the former head of counter terrorism at the politan Police, says Britain is “soft” in its approach to hardened terrorists, while Boris Johnson says he has “come to the end of my patience” when it comes to their early release.Robert Buckland, the Justice Secretary, has responded by introducing emergency legislation to block the automatic release of terrorist offenders after serving half their sentences, which is a welcome step in the right direction.Yet, at a time when organisations such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) show no sign of ending their murderous assaults against the West, the Government needs to harden even further its response to those deemed to pose an active threat to our national security.Despite the recent success coalition forces from the US, Britain and other Western countries have enjoyed in defeating the likes of Isil in Syria and Iraq, all the indications are that the threat remains as potent as ever as Isil and its associates seek to take advantage of political instability in the Middle East to regroup.In Iraq, Isil fighters are said to be forming new terror cells, while Islamist militants in Libya are eyeing opportunities to exploit the country’s descent into full-scale civil war to their advantage.Therefore, rather than viewing the threat as being in decline, which seems to be the view of many of those responsible for overseeing Britain’s approach to Islamist-inspired extremism, the Government needs to go much further than adjusting the parole terms of terrorists.There is, for example, a long established principle in relation to those convicted of other serious criminal offences, such as murder, that they must admit their guilt, as well as displaying genuine remorse, before they are considered suitable for release.And officials need to be far less naive when it comes to assessing those who claim to be interested in ending their association with extremism by signing up for deradicalisation programmes.From the formation of Al-Qaeda onwards, Islamist militants have been taught to comply with the judicial systems of Western countries with the aim of ultimately gaining their freedom and being able to return to the battlefield.And, as we have learnt to our cost from the recent cases involving Khan and Amman, truly committed Islamist terrorists remain a threat even after they have been brought to justice.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This issue was identified and fixed.It was reported that a technology company called Shadow had been paid $60,000 before Christmas to create the app.Electoral officials who reverted back to the old system of calling in results over the phone complained of long delays, with some saying they were stuck on hold for more than an hour.Both the leading candidates would be a historic break with precedent if they win the nomination. Mr Sanders is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist pledging political revolution. Mr Buttigieg hopes to be both youngest person ever to reach the White House and the first openly gay US president.Campaign staff for Mr Biden, who appeared to be heading for a poor result, wrote a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party complaining about its handling of the caucuses.The row has renewed calls for Iowa to end its idiosyncratic system of caucuses, in which people vote by moving to different corners of a room, one area for each candidate, where they are then counted.The local party had initially put out a statement blaming “inconsistencies” in the reporting of three different sets of results - a change to the procedures which only took effect this year. The statement added: “This is not a hack or an intrusion.”Mr Buttigieg, campaigning later in New Hampshire, said: We still have to do some math. But we are coming here with momentum.Mrs Warren,also in New Hampshire, said: I think they ought to get it together and release all the data.Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire candidate who did not compete in Iowa, sensed opportunity amid the chaos.He announced plans to double his TV advertising spending, which has already exceeded $100 million, in states that vote later. Sabrina Singh, his spokeswoman, said: No one has made the sale or even come close to it.Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden supporter, who served as an Iowa precinct captain for Biden on Monday, said: I think Iowa is a dumpster fire.Democrat voters in Iowa also criticised the process.Jessica Leonard, 41, who runs a food truck in Winterset, Iowa, said: It looks like a disorganised mess.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trapped board coronavirus cruise ship like","story":"It was 6.30am when the voice of the captain came over the speakers of the luxury Diamond Princess cruise ship.All passengers on board were to head to their cabins immediately - where they should remain for 14 days, the captain said.The 3,700 on board were the latest cruise ship tourists to be unexpectedly caught up in a scare over the deadly coronavirus.David Abel, 74, and his wife Sally, from Oxfordshire, told The  holidaymakers were blindsided by the early morning announcement.They had been aware that some people were being tested for coronavirus, which has so far killed close to 500 people in China and infected more than 24,000, but they did not expect the worst-case scenario on their own cruise.“He came on at 6.30am and said we’ve had all the results back and passengers are going to be removed. Everybody else, wherever on the ship you are now, you must return to your cabins immediately, don’t finish your meals,” he said.The ruling came from the Japanese health authorities after 10 passengers tested positive for the novel coronavirus and were removed from the ship in Yokohama on Wednesday morning for medical treatment.Two Australians, three Japanese, three Hong Kongers, one American and one Filipino, all aged between 50-80, were reported by cruise company Carnival to be among those infected.  The news marked a distressing end to the Abels’ trip, the first of several cruises this year to mark their 50th wedding anniversary in August.“I was a bit shaken up,” Mrs Abel said. Her husband added: “I remember swearing quite profoundly because I was ready for breakfast and that was not the news I wanted.“So I reckon it must have shocked everybody on board because nobody anticipated this. Last night we were eating with other passengers in the dining room and a conversation such as this just was not on the radar at all.”The Abels and fellow passengers are now trapped in their cabins. They are grateful to have a suite with an outdoor view and balcony but felt concerned for others who had rooms on the inside of the ship with no natural light or fresh air.“I’m trying to remain as positive as possible. It’s very difficult circumstances really because every passenger is now confined to their cabin. We can’t even open the door or walk down the corridor, so 13 days more of that is going to drive many passengers up the wall,” Mr Abel said.Everyone had been told to report any coughs, fever or aches to the ship’s medical staff but they had not been informed about any further health checks and did not know the identity of the infected passengers.“There’s going to be anxiety, most certainly there’s going to be anxiety. Are other passengers on board infectious right now? There could well be and that’s why they’re going to have to give further tests otherwise this quarantine is just going to be extended and extended and extended,” he said.“I’m not anxious in the same way as other people probably because I take life as it comes, deal with it in the best way that I can. I won’t allow it to depress me. I’m very much a positive-minded person,” he said.Mr Abel, a diabetic, said he and his wife were being well-cared for and praised the ship’s staff and Princess Cruises for doing all that they could to ease the ordeal.Passengers are receiving basic meals of bread rolls, toasted sandwiches and orange juice delivered directly to their cabins by waiters, but they have now been forbidden from smoking, even on their balconies.The prolonged lockdown would likely be mentally challenging for the majority on board, he said, adding that he was posting frequently to Facebook to keep himself occupied.“All of these video posts that I’m putting up, I’m looking at as therapy for me. It keeps me busy during the day,” he said.“Being able to talk about what we are experiencing and going through, my day has gone very quickly indeed and if I can keep it up for the rest of the cruise then I’ll be delighted, but goodness knows how other people are going to fare.”The experience had not put the couple off cruises, and they were determined to go ahead with three more this year to mark their anniversary. “We have got a whole year of celebration ahead,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/17/15/shutterstock-editorial-1549912a.jpg","title":"fast fashion giving up climate change 20 pledges 2020","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘There can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street’For the new year, I’ve decided to give up fast fashion. That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask. Now I will have to.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.The best dresses of the decade Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Actor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement. OPPaul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film Phantom Thread, centres on fictional fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love affair with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps).SYYes, you read that right. Balloon dresses. Jaws literally dropped when Central Saint Martins graduate sent models down the runway in balloon concubines that the models then popped, causing the outfits to slowly slide down onto the model\u0027s bodies, eventually becoming dresses. We\u0027re still not sure how he did it either, but the dresses sparked a frenzy on social media, with editors and fashion insiders all regaling at Tjaerands\u0027 sheer creativity. OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate. OPFor springsummer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy shunned a traditional runway show and instead chose to present their latest collection via a series of ethereal portraits.SYWhen Adut Akech stepped on stage to collect the award for 2019\u0027s model of the year, she received a standing ovation. The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals. OPBaz Luhrmann\u0027s The Great Gatsby is a visual feast for many reasons but for fashion fans in particular, it is the film’s costumes that really capture the hedonistic era of the 1920s.SYWhy limit your red carpet look to just one dress when you can have four? That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event. OPWhen Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in early December 2018, the pair paid tribute to the heritages of their families by having both Christian and Hindu ceremonies to mark the occasion.SYJared Leto, holding a model of his own head while clad in blood red robes on the 2020 Met Gala pink carpet, was quite a striking image. The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time. OPGetty Images for The Met Museum1550 36 - Sansa Stark\u0027s armour dress, Game of Thrones, 2019For the final episode of Game of Thrones, the character of Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, wore a dress that symbolised the journey she had been on to become Queen of the North.SYRihanna\u0027s outfit at the 2018 Met Gala where the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion \u0026amp The Catholic Imagination, is not one anybody is likely to forget any time soon. Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection. OPGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen it comes to making an entrance, Celine Dion knows what she\u0027s doing. Zeigfeld Girl.SYIn recent years, actor Lupita Nyong\u0027o has become one to watch on the red carpet, delivering several impressive looks throughout awards season.SYLily Rose Depp, the daughter of of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, enjoyed her second stint as a Chanel runway model in 2017, closing the fashion house’s Spring Haute Couture show. As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon.

Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google.

But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown.

The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said.

Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about.

Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black.

Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement.

The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate.

This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified.

The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals.

That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event.

SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France.

Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”.

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career.

On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry.

The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain.

Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Prince Charles then came on stage and said: “I must say I’m enormously grateful to Katy Perry for such a kind introduction, which she told me just now she wanted to make slightly more spicy, but I think she resisted the temptation.”The decision to appoint Perry an ambassador for the\u0026nbspBritish Asian Trust\u0026nbsphas been heavily criticised on\u0026nbspsocial media, with some accusing the star of encouraging “white saviour” complex.\u0026nbspThe British Asian Trust was founded in 2007 by Prince Charles and a group of British Asian business leaders.The charity supports the estimated 5.8 million children working in forced labour in India with tens of thousands thought to be working in hazardous workshops.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The parties in his left-of-centre coalition had already picked ministers for their government.Jörg Meuthen, AfD\u0027s federal party chief celebrated the result, tweeting: The first piece of the political turn in Germany: victory of the civic-minded majority! Congratulations to Thuringia!The local CDU branch has said that despite working with the AfD to install the new minister-president, they did not want to enter a formal coalition with the party.We decided to support the civic majority\u0027s candidate, said CDU local party leader Mike Mohring following the election.

Anti-Brexit comedian Nish Kumar hosted the Horrible Histories “special” song on CBBC, branded on Twitter as “British things . . . turns out there’s hardly any”.Its desperately unfunny attempt to present a “woke“ version of history by sending up the Royal Family while highlighting the slave trade was little more than thinly-veiled propaganda.It is grotesque that children should be subjected to such brainwashing.BRITS stranded in snake flu-ridden China have been going through hell.So it’s bizarre that our man in Wuhan had flown back home just as the deadly epidemic swept through the area.Consul Gareth Hoar apparently boarded a plane hours before the city went into lockdown when it should have been blindingly obvious that an emergency was developing.So which bungler thought it was a good idea to let the consul come home before stranded Britons Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weve got bottled water. The meals have completely changed, we are definitely no longer on a luxury cruise.We now get a plated meal, breakfast and lunch its been a toasted sandwich, rolls, a little desert, a couple of glasses of orange juice.Dont think Im sounding ungrateful, its just such a contrast to the first two weeks of a cruise.Its just like an extended two-week cruise, but its not going to be a luxy cruise, its going to be a floating prison.Speaking on Facebook, he wrote: It appears that our quarantine is on board the ship, that we will not be taken off to a hospital.The  people that are affected, they are being taken off very soon by the local coastguard into a medical facility. We are to remain on board the ship and we are confined to our cabins.He later posted an update on Facebook: It is .am and we have had no food or drink! This is becoming serious for me as an insulin dependent diabetic.Early this morning he posted a photo of his and his wes breakfast and captioned it: First meal in  hours. We have now anchored and on our second cruise in Japanese waters. It is going to be tough on rationed food, and with no alcohol!No services onboard the ship now. How the crew are going to cope with this beats me. This is a huge challenge for Diamond Princess.We are out at sea now converting sea water into drinking water. Ship was running low on water for showers etc.Photographs and video posted on Twitter by a passenger showed masked health workers clad in blue plastic gowns walking down empty corridors on the Diamond Princess.The trapped passenger also posted images showing views of deserted lounges and a barren deck.Carnival Japan, the local unit of the British-American cruise operator, said on Tuesday the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about  hours.The company was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the firm said that cruises scheduled to depart from Yokohama and

I had no idea what it was.Some said that the animal with a furry body, six legs and a shovel-like head was a monkey slug, also known as the hag moth caterpillar.Eric Day, an entomologist at Virginia Tech university, said the creature could deliver a nasty stingpicked up in its caterpillar form.The larvae I would not touch at all, he said.At the caterpillar stage, peoples reaction will y but most people end up with - at the very least - a reddish rash. In my case, I ended up getting some type of a blister from it.It is unpleasant and uncomfortable. I wouldnt go near itI could avoid it.He continued: The stings are defensive, theyre avoiding predation and parasites too.A lot of caterpillars are parasitised by small wasps and predated upon by birds, so these are things that give some protection.The lab manager added that the creatures six legs were not all they seemed to be.They are not true legs or arms or anything, they are projections of the body, he said.And theyre deciduous - they fall off.That might be a factor in defence, sosomething is brushing into it, those will fall off.Other creatures have that too, where they lose an appendage or a tail or something but can get away.The hag moth is native to the US, but Mr Day says theyre not altogether common.The thing is about a lot of these and other related stinging caterpillars is they have a very wide host range, he said.In the US they feed on apple trees, ash, birch, cherry, chestnut - all kinds of things.

I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing and be involved in it that I would never, ever sell it.I have always believed from that day on that the le of a member of the royal family was more valid and important that mine.I still considered it was well worth my while getting shot as opposed to Princess Anne.What I would like is whoever does eventually buy the medal, I would hope they might invite me somewhere to tell them an after-dinner story about what happened on the night.The medal - which will be auctioned off at Dix Noonan Webb in central London next month - is expected to sell for between £, and £,.Princess Anne was just -years-old when she was almost abducted in .The princess was in chauffeur-driven limo - with her then-husband Captain Phillips - driving down the Mall to the palace, when a car swerved in front of them.An armed and masked man, Ian Ball, shot at Annes car as royal police protection officer James Beaton and driver Alex Callender got out of the car tofire.During the attack James’s weapon jammed and Ball shot him three times.Alex was also shot in an attempt to disarm Ball, along with journalist Brian McConnell who tried to intervene.The attacker then got in Annes limo and told her to get out - but the Queen’s only daughter gave a ballsy response. She replied: Not bloody likely.Eventually, Anne did actually get out, with Ian following close behind.However, he was then punched by passerby Mr Russell, and police were able to arrest him.Ball had planned to abduct the princess and demand £m ransom from the Queen, but ended up being sentenced to le in prison and detained in a mental hospital.Recounting the attempted abduction, Mr Russell said: It was very fast moving but it is as clear to me now as it was the day it happened.I punched him twice.

I hit him as hard as I could -he had been a tree he would have fallen over - and he was flat on the floor face down.PC Edmonds then ed on top of him and he was arrested.Auctioneer Oliver Pepys, from Dix Noonan Webb, said: We have sold several George Medals in the past but most have been linked to the Blitz and bomb disposal in the Second World War, so to be offering this peacetime medal, with such a cracking story, is a huge honour.A wide iety of gallantry medals were given to the Magnicent Seven after the event but to my knowledge this is the first to come to auction.It is expected to be sold with other items including a telegram from Princess Anne and a letter from the Met Commissioner.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But consider how it has trashed its once-proud reputation:The use of £.billion a year of public money to crush commercial rivals and relentlessly expand. The tedious, institutional liberal-left bias in news, drama and “comedy”. The overpaid executives churning out “woke” bilge, knowing the billions will always keep rolling in.The betrayal of over-s. The waste.Fundamentally it’s a dinosaur in the Netflix era and irrelevant to many, especially young people raised on YouTube.The Government must be bold.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

Prime Minister chased around by a giant chicken  Andrew Neilaposs fault. People paying too much attention to Downing Street twonks separating journalists into goats and sheep  Quick, throw Auntie on the table and suggest that throttling her be decriminalised. The BBC solves all problems, for politicians. In the past few years it has solved them for both Government and Opposition. Having pissed off Leave and Remain, extremist and centrists, Left and Right, the broadcaster must surely be perfectly balanced. But how nice it would be, to be officially independent of them. For the regular threats and intimidation, tightening purse strings and childish tantrums, to be a thing no longer able to lead to unemployment. As any of its many freelancers could tell it, no longer having to bow the knee to an insane boss could be the making of the BBC. The TV licence fee so many complain about paying is currently  pence a day. They are obviously barking, because for less than the cost of a daily newspaper everyone in the country gets £billion-worth of stuff:  TV channels, regional TV,  national radio stations,  local radio stations, a website, a World Service in  languages, and the right to shout BOLLOCKS! at Question Time. Parents get CBeebies. Families get Strictly Come Dancing every Christmas, when the nights are long, but covered in glitter. The poor, the elderly, housebound and disengaged get, evenby accident, news, sport, and a sense of nationhood. But only %, of the Beebaposs funding comes from the licence fee. The remainder - about a billion pounds - is provided by its commercial activities, including royalties and foreign sales. By comparison, Netflix made more than £bn in . And thataposs with films like Nappily Ever After and people who havenapost seen Breaking Bad yet. How hard could it be, with all the BBC has to offer, to make more than that With more cash, it could pay Gary Lineker or Graham Norton whatever it liked, without having to publicise it. It could maintain its impartiality via Ofcom, without a board partially imposed on it by Government.It could retain more talent. It would have enough appeal to sell subscriptions, and still have no need of advertising. It would attract paying audiences worldwide, which would bring the politicians begging for interviews.ImagineAndrew Neil could have a crack at Donald Trump. Imagine.The Beeb could afford Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It could rehire Jeremy Clarkson, and apologise to Victoria Derbyshire. It might even be able to buy in Downton Abbey, a programme it was offered but unable to buy when first proposed and which, on ITV, has to recite its plot before and after every ad break. All this money is very well, the breast-beating luvvies would say. But what about the poor and disenfranchised The BBC would still have its Royal Charter, giving it a public service mission to inform, educate and entertain all audiences. All those s it currently performs without the ability, or audience, to charge - radio, for example, less-watched regional news, or the World Service which projects British values around the world, to the benefit of all - could be subsidised by the rest.Many of us would pay more than pence a day. Every parent with a brain would happily put £ in the meter for the education and entertainment offered to small children by CBeebies. Even those of mediocre wit see the benefits of the  oaposclock news, the Victoria Derbyshire Show, and Newsnight. The free TV licences for over-s which the Tories took away could even be restored.  If we ceased the endless political tinkering with an institution of immense value to the nation and the world at large, there might still be hidden costs.The forced publication of presenter salaries provoked an equal pay fight which is still not won. The requirement to serve even those who do not pay for it could be threatened in an organisation that seeks only profit.Butlaws can be passed to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, then they can be passed to protect the rights and responsibilities of the BBC and its staff. Auntie is already legally required to pay men and women alike, but doesnapost. She is already supposed to be supportive of competition, yet the website has forced a faster demise on local TV and newspapers. And the accusations of partial reporting are due, in large part, to the Americanisation of rolling, -hour news, which is killing considered analysis.But those things have all happened under a regime in which the Government of the day can threaten and bully the Beeb.

Tracy Brabin said she spoke out over the everyday sexism because she was standing up for women who get the same treatment around the world. And she said: You can’t take on the worldyou’re always worried about whether your hair’s right or not... listen to what we say, not what we wear. The -year-old politician - who took over from murdered MP Jo Cox - bared her right shoulder in a black formal dress while raising points of order with Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, , on Monday. But it was the former Coronation Street actressaposs choice of attire that attracted the attention of viewers, and she began fielding a string of insults on social media.  One Twitter user slammed the former Coronation Street actress as looking like a tart with another adding looks like sheaposs on the morning after a walk of shame.Another quipped: Is this really appropriate attire for parliament  @TracyBrabin #DressStandards. The Batley and Spen MP hit back tweeting: Hello. Sorry I donapost have time to reply to all of you commenting on this but I can confirm Iaposm not...A slag, Hungover. A tart. About to breastfeed. A slapper. Drunk. Just been banged over a wheelie bin. Who knew people could get so emotional over a shoulder... Today Ms Brabin appeared on BBC Breakfast to explain why she spoke out. She said: “I was startled by the vitriolic nature of [the comments].  It’s part of the territory as a politician. I am in privileged position that I can brush this off. But I feel that it’s my responsibility to call it out for women who don’t have that amplication. “Because there are women around the world that are putting up with this day in, day out, where they’re being demeaned for what they wear. “It’s another case of everyday sexism.” The Shadow Culture Secretary said her predecessor Tom Watson would never have been judged for his clothes because a woman is always judged more harshly than a man. Ms Brabin had been raising concerns over the governmentaposs crackdown on journalists - with the Mirror among outlets who were shut out of a No briefing- and the BBC, which could face decriminalisation of people who refuse to pay the licence fee. The MP said: There’s lots going on about the BBC and the future of the BBC and shoulders seem to take precedence. She added: “They are anonymous people often, keyboard warriors often sat in their mum’s back bedroom eating Pot Noodles having a pop at people they don’t know anything about.

Mike McComb made his millions as a mobile phone entrepreneur before eventually selling his company to BT Cellnet in . And from his fortune, the businessman upgraded to a luxury property - featuring a grand, freestanding staircase, eight bedrooms, an astonishing  bathrooms and a gym. The mansion was built two years ago and has won awards for its design and creation. Mike, from Formby, Merseyside, will show off his mansion to presenter Adrian Chiles this Friday in new show, Our Coast. After telling Adrian Chiles he has nine children – seven of whom still live at his Firwood Hall home – the presenter asks him: “Are you Roman Catholic by any chance ” Mike replies: “I am, I am!”  Then, during a walk on Formby beach, Mike tells Adrian and Mehreen why the coastline means so much to him: “It’s memories for as long as I can remember. Nothing’s changed here, thankfully. It’s amazing – where you’d go as a schoolkid with a gang of mates, your bike and your butties.“I am just so proud to live here now, from riding up on your bike and spending your summer holidays here as a kid.”Mike, who was born in a two-up, two-down in Bootle, also has a place in Marbella, but asked which he likes best, tells Adrian: “It’s always great to come home and this is home.”, reports the Liverpool Echo.  The series will focus on four stretches of coastline around the Irish Sea – taking in parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – and the opening episode is a brilliant advert for the Mersey coast, and those who live and work on it. The series begins with Adrian climbing aboard Cunard’s Queen Mary  at the Pier Head, talking to some of its passengers and then witnessing the liner’s leaving of Liverpool – complete with Katumba band and firework display: “Liverpool has done the old girl proud here,” says Adrian, “What a send-off!” Viewers will also see historian Emma D’Abiri tell the famous story of the Viking ship thought to be buried under the car park at the front of The Railway pub on Birkenhead Road, Meols.

Er, have others  “Yes,” he admits. “A couple of people have fallen in. Fortunately, most of my friends aren’t really drinkers –they don’t drink so much they’re not going to fall in the pond.” This is the -year-old Phones u tycoon’s favourite room within the £million Mayfair residence he has recently re-furbished at a cost of £million. I am on a mind-boggling personal tour of his , sq ft, eight-floor, -bedroom, London home, complete with underground eight-stack car port, which is believed to be Britain’s most expensive house. And, even though there’s a gilded ballroom downstairs, this dining room is arguably the showstopper. How could it not be when, floating dreamily above the water, is a ft preserved tree trunk crowned with silk cherry blossom, and golden lizards are climbing the wall. Although interior designers, including Real Housewives star Dawn Ward, did most of the work, the river was John’s idea, as was the lava-inspired wall running theof the subterranean swimming pool and sauna .I was ready not to particularly take to the moneyman behind the opulence, but the fact that he calls the extravagant indoor stream a “pond” is a likeable sign that he hasn’t left his roots in Stoke-on-Trent. He tells me: “I grew up in a terrace, we took the metal bath off the wall outside, carried it in and put it by the fire, and I was allowed one kettle-full of water. “John then, wouldn’t have been able to comprehend this house in his wildest dreams.” My tour had not got off to the best of starts.Stepping into the palatial hall, I was informed it was a “no shoes house”. Which led to me standing before a billionaire beneath crystal chandeliers, with my big toes poking out of holes in my tights. Thankfully, he took pity on me, and the boots went back on. For four years, John’s -strong team has been doing up the s mansion, actually, two joined together, one of them once owned by the Sultan of Brunei’s brother. We begin in the ballroom, which holds  people and where the gold leaf alone cost £,.It was key to John buying this place. Since selling Phones u for £.billion in , John has been dedicated to philanthropy, fundraising for seriously ill and disabled children through his charity Caudwell Children, and for research into Lyme disease, which affects himself and his family. He has pledged to give % of his wealth away when he dies – although his five kids won’t be left too hard up. Today, he insists the prime use of this property is as a “lure” for A-list donors. He admits he is no Elton John, “who gets everyone to his ball”. He says: “Having a home like this that everyone on the planet wants to visit, even the rich, it’s an asset that helps. Princess Beatrice came one day to have a look and see me. “She walked in – and it really tickled me. She said, ‘Oh, my gosh I’ve never seen anything like it’. I chuckled and said, ‘No, of course you haven’t’.”John and his partner Modesta Vzesniauskaite, , a former Olympic cyclist from Lithuania, have relatively modest private quarters. He gives me a glimpse of a very white kitchen with two staff members lingering, and a lounge with plain sofas. Their quarters do open on to the river-filled dining room and the couple also have an “entertainment room” in the basement, with mirrored dancefloor, a bar, velvet booths, and a pair of gold, transgender nudes. He likes “thought-provoking” art and has a butterfly-covered AK- rle in the ballroom.

Kate met Rhian Costello and her daughter Annabel during a royal visit to Swansea, Wales, with Prince William. Little Annabel was very excited to meet a real princess but was left a tad disappointed as Kate wasnapost wearing a Disney-inspired dress. The Duchess ended up apologising for not wearing a pretty dress in a very cute exchange. Instead of a glitzy gown, Kate opted for a Hobbs coat, Zara dress and an eye-catching Beulah London scarf. Rhian and Annabel waited for the royals at Mumbles pier for an hour, excited to see them. The mum said: My daughter loves fairy tales and Cinderella, and she was really excited to meet a real princess. Kate said aposIaposm really sorry Iaposm not wearing a pretty dress todayapos and Annabel said: aposI thought youaposd look like Cinderellaapos. But Rhian told the Daily Mail that despite not wearing a big Cinderella dress, Annabel was so taken with the Duchess.She added: Annabel was so taken with her, she went up and gave her a huge hug and I was extremely surprised that Kate embraced her in such a way. The mum said she hoped in  years her daughter would look back and realise what an amazing encounter sheaposd had.

Megxit from the royal family and the Duke of Sussex reportedly misses his friends in Britain alreadyShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  FEB NewsPrince Harry is already missing his old pals after moving to

Having left the UK two weeks ago to begin a new le away from the Royal Family, the Duke of Sussex is already feeling the strain of being away from his friends who have known him most of his le. Harry, Meghan and baby Archie are living in a rented mansion with round-the-clock protection as they look to become financially independent, with the prince announcing he had no other option but to step down.An insider told the Sun: Harry misses his friends of course - anyone would.But he has been in [a] WhatsApp group with his mates for years and he uses that more than ever now to keep in touch and send pictures. The group are always sharing funny video clips they find as well. Harry doesn’t think being on the other side of the world means that he will lose touch with the people he has been mates with all his le. Meghan had quickly ed to Vancouver - where the couple spent a six-week hiatus over Christmas - following their bombshell announcement last month. But Harry remained in the UK until a fortnight ago, attending a crunch meeting with the Queen over his future as a royal.The decision to leave Britain behind comes as the Sussexes look set to make millions in foreign endorsements, but it could mean less time for the princeaposs old ties. His aposGlosse Posseapos, a group of mates from Gloucestershire he grew up with at dad Prince Charlesapos estate in Highgrove, have often been spotted with the royal including polo and rugby matches as he grew up. They include Guy Pelly and Tom Inskip and we Lara, who have apparently drted from their royal pal in recent months. Tom - who Harry has known since childhood - is said to have been against his friendaposs marriage to Meghan but was at their wedding. And the prince was there for Tom and Lara after the latteraposs mum died last summer at just  in Londonaposs Cha and Westminster Hospital after a long-term mental illness.  Nicknamed Skippy, the fellow Eton College alumni, was often seen by Harryaposs side during the Dukeaposs single days and had arranged the trip to Las Vegas in  when Harry was photographed naked with showgirls at a jacuzzi party. Guy Pelly, who also attended the wedding at Windsor, is a close childhood friend of both Harry and William and is the godfather to the latteraposs youngest son Louis. A former nightclub manager, Guy turned Mayfairaposs Mahiki into one of Londonaposs biggest celebrity hotspots. His mum Lady Carolyn Herbert was close friends with the late Princess Diana and heaposs known as a aposLondon aristocratapos - as well as a bit of a party animal within the royal circle. He was with Harry for the infamous Nazi costume party incident.  Harry served as Charlie van Straubenzeeaposs best man, with the pair having first met at Ludgrove Prep School. Charlie has since become Head of UK Financial Intermediaries for Brown Advisor. His older brother is property mogul Thomas van Straubenzee who is also a close friend of both Harry and William, and is Princess Charlotteaposs godfather. Thomas made a speech at William and Kateaposs wedding in . It was reported last month that Harry had been gradually moving away from his old pals prior to his move with most no longer even having his mobile number anymore. A source told the Sun: Harry is mindful that everyone is waiting to see what he and Meghan do next and he wants this to be a really transformational year for them all as a family. First, he wants to make this year’s Invictus Games the best ever.  In years gone by he has had to juggle his Royal duties with planning the Games. But now he can just focus on the Games which he is loving. He is able to be even more hands on than usual and really wants to put his mark on the way it looks and feels.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Gusts of up to mph could be felt in some coastal areas this weekend with the Met Office warning of very strong winds throughout the country.Forecasters have issued a yellow weather warning covering the entirety of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland from pm on Saturday and throughout Sunday. Many inland areas of the UK could experience gusts of up to mph, the Met Office said, while gales of between -mph could hit exposed coasts and hills, especially in the north and west. Heavy rain is also expected, forecasters said. Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: After a dry start to the week for many, with some sunny spells, early frosts and fog patches, the weather will become more unsettled as we head towards the weekend. This warning is expected to be updated as we get nearer to the weekend and confidence grows in the exact track and intensity of the weather system that is causing the wind and also bringing the potential for some heavy rain. Although still a long way off in forecast terms, there are signals the unsettled weather arriving this weekend could also continue into next week. Today, meanwhile, will be fine and dry for most with some good sunny spells and lighter winds and minimal fog patches.  And yesterday, the Met Office said it was too early to warn with any certainty of heavy snowfall later this month. Some forecasts last week predicted imminent snow but new analysis radars suggest this is no longer the case. Temperatures will, in fact, remain mild for the coming days, even peaking at C in places in the southwest on Friday, in a repeat of the latter stages of last month.  But this may prove to simply be the calm before the storm, before the monster gales run riot across the country on Saturday and Sunday. Speaking to , Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: It will get colder next week but it is too early to forecast whether thereaposll be snow or what temperatures we should expect.We can only say with a great deal of uncertainty what the  weather may be at this early stage.Polar maritime air moving in from the north will cause temperatures to fall. There is potential for some snow in parts of the north but thataposs not a certainty by any means.  Itaposll remain mild this week and on Saturday and Sunday potentially. Temperatures will be in double figures for most of the country before then, around  or C in places. There is potential for heavy rain though when it becomes windier. As we go through the next few days, it is likely the weather warning for wind will be refined or trimmed down somewhat as it is too early to tell where itaposll be at its worst at the moment unfortunately. There is potential for weather warnings for rain too. The unsettled pattern should remain for the rest of the month, forecasters add. The average temperature for the UK for February is C but most parts of the country have exceeded that each day so far this month, including Bournemouth which hit C on Monday.  UK  day weather forecast Today: A few fog patches around in the south this morning but otherwise a fine day for most with some good sunny spells and light winds. Windier and cloudier in the far north with some light rain, mainly for hills. Tonight: Cloudy in the far north with a little light rain for northwest Scotland and the Northern Isles. Cold with good clear spells where and fog patches, particularly in the south.

A culture of “avoidance and denial” that was uncovered by an inquiry will add to the misery of hundreds who suffered at his cruel hands. Fresh horrors may be discovered after the , patients he operated on at NHS and private hospitals in the West Midlands over  years are recalled for assessment. Paterson, serving a -year jail term for  counts of wounding with intent, is a disgrace to a noble profession whose mission is to save and enhance lives, not ruin them. Implementing in full the report into the scandal will, hopefully, stop another rogue surgeon running amok unchecked for a decade-and-a-half. As he sits in prison, Paterson should hang his head in shame. Dodgy motive Locking people up for refusing to pay a TV licence and fine seems unnecessarily heavy-handed. However we are right to question the motives behind a consultation over whether non-payment should stay a criminal offence.Rabid Tories are bashing the BBC because they feel it doesn’t broadcast enoughConservative Party propaganda and now under a cloak of fairness the sneaky party appears determined to undermine it. The Beeb fears a change could cost it £million.Blaming the BBC for a broken Tory promise to maintain free TV licences for all over-s, clearly isn’t enough for them.

Treka Engleman said she knew she always wanted to be a foster mum, but she wasnapost prepared for the backlash she would face when raising three white youngsters. Treka, a teacher from Cincinnati, Ohio, in the USA, said: Iaposve had people say I must have self hate and that there are a lot of black kids that need homes so why adopt white kids  People have said that I am continuing a slave mentality. It upset me at first, but I just want to protect my kids. Iaposve had people in a store say aposyou must be babysitting,apos and Iaposm like aposno these are my kidsapos and I just walk away. I donapost want people to say those kind of things around them. Unfortunately I knew I would get bad comments, but for me the colour of my children doesnapost matter. Treka, , knew from an early age that she was destined to be a foster mother and adopter. She said: I grew up in large family with five sisters and five brothers.  I was the youngest of  children, and my mother passed away when I was six-years-old. I was brought up in church and there was a family there going into foster care when I was about -years-old and it broke my heart that they were getting separated. There were five or six siblings and there was not a family that could take all of them in, and from that experience I knew even more than before that I wanted to be a foster mum.  In  Treka took courses at St. Joseph Orphanage in Cincinnati to get a license to become a foster mum. After earning her license in August of that year, she fostered her first child Elijah, who was just six-days-old at the time. His biological mother was a drug addict and he was born addicted to drugs. Treka went on to foster Alexis, , in May  and her sister Mercedes, , in March .  Both sisters had been placed in the foster care system at a young age because their biological mother was unable to care for them adequately. On November , , Treka decided to officially adopt all three children. We had a connection already and once theyaposve been in your home for so long, they needed me and I needed them. They were a part of the family and I couldnapost split them up, she said. Despite the cruel and ignorant comments Treka says she is completely devoted to her children.

But a few hours later, that same figure was still stood stock still in the window. So the woman decided to go in search of a better view in the hopes that she could work out what on earth was going on.Upon finding a better view point, she soon burst out laughing.What she thought had been a person was actually a cardboard cutout of Dame Judi Dench. She quickly shared the hilarious tale with her friend, the musician Amy Macdonald - you might have heard of her and her song Mr. Rock  Roll.Amy proceeded to share the story on Twitter, alongside hilarious photos of cardboard Judi. She tweeted: My mate was in work and she noticed a woman standing at the window in one of the flats opposite. She didnapost really think anything of it. She thought it was just a woman enjoying a coffee whilst looking out the window. She started to get a bit worried when hours had passed and this woman had not moved. She went to get a better view.

That happens in football.“I want to play and I’ve played the majority of my career in Scotland so when the opportunity came up to join a massive club, there was only one thing on my mind and that was to come up here and get it sorted.“I came up to Dundee last Friday and was in the stadium the majority of the day getting things sorted.“I knew a few of the boys from before but Saturday was the first day I actually met the team so it’ll be good to have a full week together before this weekend’s game.“It is hard to come into a team like that, you just have to adapt quickly.“It can actually be a good thingyou don’t know many people because you have to make an effort to get to know them and their game.”And Elliott has been impressed with the quality in the Dens Park squad, evenhe felt they should have done better in his debut at Cappielow last Saturday.“There are big players in this team.

It was route one stuff as the -cap Scotland international pinged a long ball up to Hemmings. He got the better of debutant Sean McGinty before spinning and firing the ball home.Despite their strong start, Dundee were pegged back on  minutes by former favourite McAlister. Shaun Byrne gave away the free-kick -yards out giving Nicky Cadden a look at goal. His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break. The linesman#s flag, though, was already up for offside.After the break, Orsi looked certain to score only for Berra to get a vital toe on the ball at the last moment. The ball, though, careered off Forster#s leg before bobbling wide of the post.On  minutes, Morton were reduced to  men after Kyle Jacobs went in heavily on Hemmings on the halfway line to earn his second yellow of the contest. Home fans weren#t happy after referee Bobby Madden played an advantage before pulling the game back to book Jacobs but the tackle certainly warranted a caution.Moments later and Dundee were inches away from making the extra man count immediately as Declan McDaid curled a good effort off the far post and Forster headed the rebound wide.Hemmings went close two minutes later only for Chris Millar to block before Christie Elliott almost marked his debut with a fine goal after replacing Crankshaw.The former Partick man cut in from his left wing position and hit a fine effort that flew just past the far post.A man light, Morton were happy to hold their shape and sit back while Dundee played the ball around the middle of the park.With eight minutes to go, though, Ton had the chance to steal the points as Orsi rose in the centre of goal but headed wide of the post.In stoppage time, Elliott thought he had grabbed a late winner on his debut but his free-kick clipped the wall and drted just wide of the post with goalie Danny Rogers stranded.Morton: Rogers, Tumilty, McGinty, Jacobs, McAlister, Orsi , Strapp, Cadden , Sutton , Colville, Baird.Subs not used: Ramsbottom, McLean, McHugh, McGuffie.Dundee: Hazard, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Berra, Byrne, Dorrans, Callachan, McDaid, Crankshaw , Hemmings.Subs not used: Hamilton, Meekings, Robertson, Anderson, Cameron.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street united need a breather and dundees new no 7 impresses","story":"This week Tele sports writers George Cran, Calum Woodger and Graeme Finnan discuss Dundee United’s mini-blip, Christophe Berra’s Dundee debut and ask, Leigh Grfiths – innocent or guilty Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e345523ec0307.65145736.jpg ","title":"wily old fox dick campbell is top dog for utd boss","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson thinks Arbroath gaffer Dick Campbell should be in the running for Manager of the Year.Campbell brings his Red Lichties side to Tannadice today sitting just a point outside of the Championship promotion play-off spots after winning League One last season.And Robbie reckons his exploits with the Angus men should have Campbell in the running for the PFA Manager of the Year prize, backing him to continue the job he’s done until the end of the campaign.“Dick would be up there.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle. The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled. But leasing experts such as Intelligent Car Leasing will fully explain everything to make the process for your next car lease deal as easy and as comfortable as possible.Leasing electric: itrsquos the new way to drive for a more sustainable future.www.intelligentcarleasing electric-deals-------------------------------------------------------------------Electric  Hybrid Vehicles at Bridgend Motor GroupGo Green with Bridgend Motor Grouprsquos EV Centre, Ayrshirersquos first and only electric and hybrid vehicle specialist for sales, servicing and repairs.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles. I have worked for Helensburgh Toyota for  years and demand for hybrid has never been higher.If yoursquore new to Hybrid and are looking to experience Toyota Hybrid for yourself, why not book and appointment at the Helensburgh Hybrid Drive Event on Saturday  February.The team at Helensburgh Toyota are only too happy to give you more information and take you out on a test drive.www.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.helensburgh.toyota-------------------------------------------------------------------JorroIn  Jorro was created to be specialists in EV Charging for drivers and businesses across Scotland. Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely. To access the grants and extended three year warranty you must use an approved installer and check that like Jorro, they are approved by both OLEV and EST.The smallest fast charger on the market, which is smaller than an A piece of paper, EO Mini Pro is proving very popular for those looking for a discreet solution.Did you know Jorro offer charge points that can charge the car for free  If you have Solar Panels you can use the generated electricity to power the car with a Zappi Charge Point. Even in Scotland a typical Solar PV System can provide more than  miles of range per day.Some drivers may not have a convenient place to charge at home so installing charge points at work may be the solution with businesses able to claim up to pound, in grant funding to install charging for staff.

More than four out of every five people in the UK have access to a carworldwide, there are around a billion cars in use, and each year, almost  million are manufactured.Almost all scientists agree this is a major factor in climate change, and even climate sceptics acknowledge that the internal combustion engine is environmentally damaging and a health problem air pollution, to which motor vehicles are a big contributor, kills seven million people globally each year, and . million more die in road traffic accidents.But the alternatives to petrol and diesel are no panacea. Even the best of them, liquid hydrogen engines , have environmental costs in manufacturing the fuel. And therersquos the practical problem that you canrsquot fill up your car unless you live near one of the -odd stations, which are all in Calornia or Japan.The manufacture of battery-powered electric cars has a similar carbon cost to conventional vehicles, while the mining of rare earth elements, and metals such as lithium and cobalthas a signicant environmental cost. And you donrsquot do much to reduce the use of fossil fuelsyou plug in your electric vehicle and it gets its charge from a coal-fired power station. When it comes to health, battery-powered cars could potentially even increase particulate emissions.In any case, when it comes to the environment, consumers like talking about it more than they like doing anything. For all the campaigns against drinking straws or carrier bags, there will be huge resistance to greener replacements until they offer comparable benefits to those of existing cars.People value the freedom and flexibility of cars, and current electric vehicles are technically limited ndash especially in range. Theyrsquore fine for town use, but you probably couldnrsquot drive one much further than Aberdeen to Glasgow without a y period recharging. Aberdeen to London ndash a -mile, nine-hour drive on one tank of petrol or diesel ndash would take at least twice as long, since it takes most electric vehicles eight hours fully to recharge, and very few have a range above  miles.Perhaps the electric technology will improve, or perhaps hydrogen carswill catch on. In either case, however, the entire infrastructure of filling stations will have to be converted. There are currently , of them , and many more would be needed, and closer together, for electric charging. Itrsquos hard to see how rural areas like the West Highlands will acquire those new facilities within  years.There is the possibility, then, especially given the rather unexpected revised plan to prohibit new hybrids, that these measures could actually increase the number of cars on the roads, with all the attendant pressures on parking, congestion and so on,it turns out that those who can afford to keep more than one: an electric run-around for short trips, and an old-fashioned vehicle for longer journeys, or those in remote areas.This ambitious and high-minded target may be intended to force car manufacturers into change, but it also assumes that they can come up with the goods ndash which is by no means guaranteed.It may have the unintended consequence of making the UK resemble Cuba after the revolution, when ancient cars stayed on the road for decades, because replacements were unavailable because of American sanctions.Cars need to get fast again. If affordable, quickly-charged and long-range new vehicles, and the support networks for them, arenrsquot developed pronto, we could still be in polluting petrol and diesel models long after . Unfortunately, the cars we currently drive donrsquot look as picturesque as s Buicks, and wonrsquot last as well, either."},{"url":null,"title":"hippfest-festival-celebrates-10th-anniversary","story":"And now audiences will once again enjoy the wonders of the cinema as it was before the age of sound as Scotlands only festival dedicated to silent films gets underway.Details have been revealed of the programme for the th edition of the event, which takes place in the in the BNess Hippodrome, Scotlandrsquos oldest purpose-built cinema, during March.The Mask of Zorro will be screenedAffectionately known as lsquoHippFest, the festival celebrates the magic of early cinema by showcasing restored versions of films rarely seen by modern qudiences, each one accompanied by live music, just as they would have been on their original opening night.:The GFT at  - a celebration of the beating heart of Glasgows love for filmOrganisers Falkirk Community Trust say this years programme is packed with silent films featuring masked crusaders, real-le martyrs and mysterious femme fatales, and will also offer talks, workshops and tours for those who attend.And, in the spirit of the iconic Keystone Cops of the era, the event will begin with a huge custard pie fight among willing participants.Alison Strauss, Festival Director, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be celebrating our th edition, and so grateful to our audiences for joining us on the journey so far.\"Expectations are high but we are confident that this yearrsquos HippFest will be our most successful yet. \"Alison StraussAmong the highlights of the will be the world premiere of a new restoration of  drama The Loves of Mary, Queen of Scots, an extremely rare British historical feature film full of intrigue, betrayal and scandal.Directed by Denison Clt the film was one of the last made by the major British studio Ideal before the cinema entered a slump in  and many indigenous filmmaking firms closed.It stars Fay Compton, one of the icons of the British silent scene as Mary, along with Gerald Ames and Ivan Samson.Fay Compton as Mary, Queen of ScotsOther productions ing to the big screen in Scotland for the first time in decades include The Mark of Zorro, a swashbuckling epic from  starring screen-idol Douglas Fairbanks as the elusive swordsman and original caped crusader.To get into the spirit of the adventure film, audiences are encouraged to dress up as Zorro, while music will be provided by Scotlandrsquos own mariachi band, lsquoRapido Mariachirsquo.Screen highlights during the festival will also include the premiere of Laurel and Hardyrsquos recently restored Duck Soup from , which was later remade with sound as Another Fine Mess.:Paisley lsquoBlack Hogmanayrsquo tragedy -Victims to be remembered at wreath-laying ceremonyDanish superstar of the s Asta Nin also appears in a screen version of Hamlet, playing a cross-dressing Hamlet whose true sex is kept secret to secure the future of the throne.The festival will start witha custard pie fightOther international highlights include Ernst Lubitschrsquos Lady Windermerersquos Fan, based on Oscar Wildersquos hit play, Chinese silent A String of Pearlsbased on Guy de Maupassantrsquos short story The Necklace, and Filibus: The Mysterious Air Piratean exciting thriller about a Baroness turned jewel-thief and uses an airship.ActorPaul McGann will to provide live narration of the closing night screening of French film LrsquoHomme du Large .Sambrooke Scott, Manager of Film Hub Scotland said: \"Itrsquos a fantastic showcase of film from another age, brought vividly to new le by a host of wonderful musicians through their brilliant live scores.\"Itrsquos a rare jewel of festival that brings excited audiences from near and afar and this yearrsquos edition promises to be one of the best yet.Laurel and Hrdy will featureDavid White, Chair of Falkirk Community Trust said: ldquoThis world-class festival is packed with distinctive community events and high-profile film restorations accompanied by some of the most accomplished musicians working in this unique field.\"\"The organisers have pulled together a programme to appeal to all ages, and reaching right across the community.\"We would also like to take this opportunity to thank our core funders, local businesses, and all the film archivists, artists and musicians who work with the teams at Falkirk Community Trust to make this Festival one of Scotlandrsquos great cultural events.\""},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   The shocking realities of life on Universal Credit","story":"ARRIVING with the usual claims of ldquounprecedented access, the BBCrsquos look at the introduction of Universal Credit seemed to cover the familiar terrain of desperate claimants up against a shambolic system.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Trivandrum may now officially be Thiruvanathapuram but older names sometimes stick. A few months ago I was in Mumbai, and noticed how many people there still call the city Bombay – a rather more beautul name, in spite of the soft syllables of Mumbai. Mumbai sounds like mother Bombay is evocative of style and glamour, and all the ebullience for which that city of  million people is renowned. And then there is Bollywood, a perfect name, that would lose all its appeal were it to become Mollywood.Yesterday in TrivandrumI had two contrasting conversations. India is a country that loves conversations we, by contrast, are tight-lipped in the public space, and apt to view conversational forays with indference, sometimes even with suspicion. : Some more proof we really are all Jock Tamson’s bairns – leader comment: Why ‘sedition’ has no place in a mature democracy – leader comment‘Everybody hates the British’In India one engages, and at the literary festival I have been attending, there has been a dizzying amount of engagement. The first conversation was unusual, though, as it was an exception to the courtesy with which India treats visitors. The conversation, which took place over lunch with two women who were readers of my books, one of them a public intellectual here in India, started well enough, but was suddenly marred by the younger of the two announcing, “Everybody hates the British, you know.” She then added, for good measure, “The English are really dreadful people.”This was over a plate of fish curry. Silence. She stared at me. A possible response might have been to point out that England and Scotland are dferent countries, but then her first comment had been about the British, a rather broader description. However one interpreted it, though, it was a breach of comity. You do not address a stranger in that way, and no entire people can be described as really dreadful, eventheir ancestors did some dreadful things.The conversation moved to historical apology, a familiar enough theme, with well-rehearsed arguments on the role of apology in committing the wrongs of the past to history. The Amritsar Massacre is still a sore topic here, and its centenary has revived the sense of hurt it engendered. This, I thought, was an echo of that hurt.Long shadowsThe second conversation was a complete contrast. That took place under a tree, with a retired lecturer in English language from a local college, a man who embodied all the charm and moral seriousness that one encounters in so many in this country. Le in India has a serious edge to it that is sometimes obscured in the affluent West: people here have often had to struggle for their education they have to battle against a harsh climate, want, corruption, and the sheer weight of a massive population. How does one get ahead in leone is rubbing shoulders with over a billion people Matters of the mind are very pressing here. We talked about the state of India today, about the long shadows of caste and, more broadly, the burdens of history. There are Scotsmen everywhere in Indian history, he said to me. “Look around this place – that observatory down there, for example – that was a Scotsman who set it up. And all the engineers on the railways and the teachers and the missionaries in this place – Kerala has a large Christian population – so many of those were Scotsmen. And you know something  They believed in education, when our local potentates only wanted their people educated.” They, at least, were not really dreadful.There is, of course, real and understandable resentment over the depredations of the British Raj, and indeed over company rule. William Dalrymple’s The Anarchy is much talked about in India at present: he shows theand depth and breadth of the exploitation of India by a relatively small number of British aries. But it is not just British colonialism that comes into contemporary Indian political debate – there is a far more signicant instance of history being used for contemporary political purposes in this country.Europe’s identity politicsThis occurs in the contemporary argument in India over identity politics. Here the time-scale is much longer, and stretches back thousands of years to the origins of contemporary Indian civilization. Is Indian civilization indigenous to India, or did it originate by way of Steppe migration  You might think this was ancient history – and it sounds rather like it – but it lies at the heart of the current political le of this country. Identity is tied up with citizenship, and the rights that citizenship confers. Is India a monocultural country or is it a pluralistic country composed of a patchwork of faiths and secular identities In Mumbai I had lunch with an old friend, an Indian writer, who was on the verge of tears as he spoke of these arguments. It is a very isive issue, but then identity politics is a very isive issue wherever it raises its head. It is their internal problem, of course, but we are peripherally caught up in India’s identity issues because Scots were part of the Raj, no matter how much we may pretend that it was an English enterprise. Remember all the railway engineers and administrators, all the district commissioners and so on in Africa.And of course we have our own identity issues. They are simmering away in the background, and come to the fore whenever there is a debate about Gaelic road signs and Gaelic-speaking police cars. And then there is the small matter of European identity.A sense of local identity is important, and gives meaning and texture to le, but it can be a potent agent of conflict. Perhaps we would all benefitthe emphasis were to sht from subsidiary identities, and to focus on the identity that really matters: our shared humanity, our planetary identity, so to speak. An important aspect of our identity is that we are late Homo sapiens. The other ieties of Homo, we might remind ourselves, are no longer here.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk government must never be allowed to blacklist journalists it doesn t like leader comment","story":"The UK Government#s decision to bar selected media organisations from a Brexit briefing by civil servants is an alarming step towards #populist# attacks on the free press.If there’s one thing that unites the dictators, tyrannical monarchs and undemocratically ‘elected’ presidents of this world, it is a passionate hatred of the free press.In a country where an inidual has illegitimately assumed absolute control, they become like the sacred king in Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer’s book The Golden Bough, constantly living in fear of being murdered by their successor. Having strived for power, they now find themselves trapped by it, almost forced to lash out, sometimes with deadly force, at those who dare ridicule them or point out flaws.Over the last few years, an alarming trend has been gathering force in the democracies of the world, in which so-called ‘populist’ leaders have started to attack the press in ious dferent ways.: Journalists walk out after Number  bars outlets from Brexit briefing: White House bans BBC and critical press from key briefingIn Vladimir Putin’s Russia, “murders and physical attacks against journalists continue to go unpunished”, according to Reporters Without Borders. And Draconian laws have been used by the state to put pressure on the press to the extent that “leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence”, it adds in the  World Press Freedom Index entry for th-placed Russia.‘Enemy of the People’However, some populists have adopted slightly subtler tactics. Donald Trump, for example, regularly lambasts the “mainstream media” or what he sometimes calls the “fake news media” and “the Enemy of the People”, a phrase long associated with dictators like Stalin. Membership of this group appears to include most of the biggest names in American journalism: the Washington Post, the New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS and CNN. It is a tactic designed to cast doubt on anything they report and bolster news organisations that explicitly support Trump.In this respect, Boris Johnson is not remotely like Putin or even Trump. However, the decision to bar journalists working for selected news outlets from a briefing on his Government’s Brexit strategy given by civil servants, who are supposed to be politically neutral, is an alarming sign of a step towards this populist strategy. The Scotsman and other Scottish media were also not informed about the briefing.Such actions by politicians are not unprecedented. In , reporters from the , Daily Mail andsaid they were barred from then First Minister Alex Salmond’s first press conference after the independence referendum, although this was perhaps less serious as it was held to announce his resignation.All-for-one solidarityBut for anyone who thinks such actions are not particularly worrying, the UK Government’s ban on some members of the press resulted in a boycott of the briefing by leading political correspondents, including the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston and reporters from the , the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Financial Times and the .This rare display of all-for-one solidarity across the press’s political spectrum was designed to send a message to the UK Government that it must heed – the British mainstream media will not collude in this populist tactic.Politicians can obviously give interviews to inidual journalists they think will give them more favourable coverage or, just as Johnson avoided the BBC’s Andrew Neil ahead of the general election, they can avoid journalists they fear.But they absolutely cannot enlist civil servants and the apparatus of Government to systematically exclude news organisations that criticise them in an attempt to influence scrutiny of their actions.And it is a challenge to the freedom of the press that journalists must stand against. The alternative is to take an immoral, dishonest path towards providing increasingly obsequious coverage in the hope of avoiding being added to the blacklist.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

The Upper Bann MLA said: “In light of the Minister of Finance’s January monitoring round on Monday, I questioned the rationale behind allocating £.m for the replacement of street lighting columns, when there was no allocation to fund the , streetlights that need repaired across Northern Ireland. “My office has been inundated in recent months with reports of street light faults across Upper Bann and we have been issued responses claiming that due to budgetary constraints only electrical structural street lighting issues are being prioritised. “This issue is a serious, ongoing concern for residents, currently large parts of the province have been left in darkness and it must be addressed urgently.”In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the ProvinceAdam and mates cook up a storm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"Having secured what she describes as her dream job Wendy Walker was determined to perform her duties as a police officer in Northern Ireland for a full term of  years.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Orangemen aim toscale KilimanjaroMasonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"edmund rice to host an evening of light","story":"EDMUND Rice College in Glengormley are inviting the public to attend a special night to support mental health across the North Belfast community.The Evening of Light will take place at the school tonight Wednesdayat pm featuring music and reflection.Music will form a reflective and peaceful atmosphere for the evening, delivered by the Edmund Rice College School Choir, current Year  pupil Robert Hamilton and musicians Two Tempo.There will also be an opportunity to hear from two key speakers from Alpsand Mind Skills and information on their respective programs on mental health, resilience and suicide prevention.The first guest speaker, Frank Diamond is an integral part of the team at Live and Learn Alps, a not for profit organisation, working directly with communities offering support, guidance and education around mental health awareness and suicide prevention.The organisation was founded in September  and has trained upwards of , people in QPRtraining.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe road has been closed.

Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

Pond Park, in Kilrea, for example, has several street lights out and this is one of the main routes to two schools as well as a well-used walking route for local people.The Bann DEA representative added: “I am grateful to the Street Lighting Engineer for the Northern Division for his help in this matter and look forward to working with the Department in the future to ensure that all these issues are resolved.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The First XV made their experience known at the Foyle College’s Limavady Road campus, dominating both halves with slick passing, clever footwork and powerful drives forward.Foyle had been aiming to cause an upset as the odds of beating the superior Campbell College were stacked against them. Beating Carrick Grammar - at home in Round  of the competition, Foyle’s coaches Ally Ferguson and Neil Stewart will have relished the opportunity to challenge such a highly rated team in the fourth round tie.Having taken Foyle’s players to Limerick to play against quality teams like Crescent College this year, they had logged an impressive win against Rainey earlier this season. Before the game, Foyle Director of Rugby, Paul O’Kane had highlighted the need to perform from the first whistle but it was not to be as Foyle conceded an unconverted try in the opening  minutes.Despite this, Foyle still looked bright with their forwards dominating scrums in the opening stages albeit conceding possession too easily whilst passing out. Campbell College’s lock D. Harkin drove forward brilliantly utilising skilful footwork and Foyle heads dropped as Harkin brought the ball down in the centre of the try line allowing fly half M. Rae to easily convert, widening the score to  points.A misunderstanding between two Foyle players resulted in a collision in collecting a Campbell drop kick and summed up the gulf in quality and experience between the two sides. Another brilliant run forward with slick hands from Campbell College saw centre L. Kenny score a converted try. Campbell College’s quality of passing was what allowed them to get forward so easily, despite Foyle gaining territory regularly, they were unable to match Campbell’s quality meaning they could not make the most of possession.Driving forward  minutes before half time, Campbell’s centre M. Booth gained another try and fly half R. Rae once again confidently converted to bring the half time score to - googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The heavens opened at half time to compound Foyle’s struggles but the squad looked undeterred lining up for the second half. It was in these opening stages that Campbell showcased their strength in a flurry of rucks and mauls, making the most of possession and flanker J. Jeffery scoring a decisive  points. It was the conversion of this try in the second half that sealed Foyle’s fate bringing a dference of  points and the score that would last the rest of the game. Despite the away team’s D. Harkin and J. Jeffrey dominating rucks and winning possession it was then midway through the second half when the intensity of their drives forward dropped. Knowing there was little chance of Foyle coming back in the game Campbell College allowed Foyle to push forward, maintain possession and come closest to scoring the coveted points they so desperately searched for. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Foyle College break forward. A rouse of the crowd and a succession of line outs close to Campbell’s try line saw tensions rise between the two teams, with a resulting ruck ending in flared tempers. The gain of territory and maintaining of possession from the penalising of a number of high tackles from Campbell College proved fruitless for Foyle however with the away side able to break the lines and push Foyle back into their own half.The final whistle at - sealed Foyle’s fate with an exit from the Danske Medallion Shield but the players shouldn’t be too disheartened by the scoreline. This was a quality side they went up against in Campbell College with a wealth of experience to make the most of their dominance. Foyle Principal, Patrick Allen offered his commiserations to the team on social media stating he was, “proud of the commitment and determination shown by the boys.” It will be an incredibly useful learning curve for Foyle who despite exiting the competition will take the tough lessons learned onto the rest of their season. They should eagerly look forward to facing Campbell College again in the future knowing first hand the quality of one of the best sides in the land.

Over the last five years he has lived in Dublin, Vancouver and London, crafting his own way through music. He has toured the States with the Five Irish Tenors and Europe with Anuna. He’s back in Derry and was recently working with Kieran Brown.“That’s how I started working with Paul Casey .“Kieran had organised to record a song we did called Hold On which mainly focused around the area of men’s mental health and we got a great response. “Paul really believed in me and what I could do as a performer vocalist. I’ve been performing for quite a while so I’m no stranger to the stage and singing is all I want to do. “So, from there I took matters into my own hands, recorded my first album with Paul and launched it in the Guildhall which in the end almost sold out so I was buzzing and quite overwhelmed with the response. “Then, with the band The Inside Out, we had just launched our EP in Sandino’s and it was class singing our own tunes to a decent crowd, about two weeks after that Paul buzzed me and asked me did I want to do Homegrown which was an unreal experience and to share the stage with one of my favourite bands PORTS was pretty special.”He really talks that enthusiastically. He’s a wee bit like being always at that point just before drunk when you’re feeling great – that’s George. googletag.cmd.push You’ve been busy promoting your own stuff but who  from Derry are you into  “At the minute Conor Mason’s new album On the Surface is on repeat, the first listen I liked a few songs, after the second and third I’m now totally hooked. A brilliant musician, a beautul voice and just total sincerity in his delivery. “PORTS are another and I’m itching to hear their new material, they shared a little at Homegrown and I loved it, they’re a masterful group of musicians and they just ooze comradeship, The Few and Far Between and Ancient Wave are my go to tunes. “Steven McCool is one of the best singers to come out of this town and he and all the band are fantastic. Elma Orkestra’s Flutter: Part One was something I didn’t see coming from Eoin and its cinematic style is stunning. “One song, Drive, in particular, got me through some tough times in LondonI’m being honest. I went to BLOOD’s album launch and yeah Noella and Jeanette are my cousins, but they’ve been a big inspiration of mine growing up. “Two fearless performers with two beautul raw and passionate voices, writing songs from their very core, I absolutely love them.” They absolutely love him back, Noella told me: “George’s music reflects the beautul soul he is, a gorgeous man with a gorgeous voice,” and Jeanette added, “He does this with a pure heart and a level of passion and love for his art that’s innate”. He’s also putting the feelers out for a record I’ve been looking for for ages, the absolute dote. He’s not one for sitting about though, I’m led to believe this is going to be a busy year for him with a few surprises lined up so what’s next for you George  “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast on February . I’ll be releasing my new album in February also and on February  I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and The Priests.“Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best.” So, what’s the craic with the new album  googletag.cmd.push “I’m going to let it go out for pre-order on February , with it set for an April  release digitally. I get hard copies next week which I’ll leave in Cool Discs, meaning the only place people can buy the actual physical copy before the official release will be there!.”Keep up to date with George on his Facebook and Instagram and, sure why not, land down to Cool Discs for his albums.Al do a piece next week, send ye questionsIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

However, there was a noticeable lack of enthusiasm on the part of most councillors and no final decision has been reached.Many councillors feel that the district is in such an appalling state that they could be embarrassed at the results of the competition.MOURNES mdash A  year-old schoolgirl who collapsed from the early stages of exhaustion in the Mourne Mountains on Tuesday was brought down safely by rescue teams.The girl was one of a party of ten Belfast schoolchildren with two instructors and she collapsed on the Brandy Pad, near Harersquos Gap.

Flooding peoplersquos lives with the hope found in the good news of the gospel, bringing out the God-colours into the world.That is to be your primary aim as a Bishop.The sermon was followed by the Rite of Ordination and for the ordination prayer and laying on of hands, Archbishop Clarke was joined by other bishops, the Methodist President and former Presidents.The new bishop was then vested in his robes and given a Bible before being presented to the congregation who greeted him with loud, sustained applause. The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev Stephen Forde, then installed Bishop McClay in his cathedral stall.At the reception which followed in Ulster Universityrsquos Birley Building, Bishop McClay expressed his thanks to all those who had taken part in the service, his parents and family and the many people who had travelled a distance to be there.Bishop McClay said he looked forward to building on the work of two predecessors, Bishop Harold Miller and Bishop Gordon McMullan, who he had been ldquoprivileged to serve under.He added: ldquoIrsquom very grateful for all that they have put in place by way of a heritage to build upon.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

They are sharing knowledge and best practice in tackling some of the many global challenges we face today.ldquoIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity to both enjoy these celebrations and indeed to visit the school here in Newcastle.Ms Gross told her audience: ldquoAs language students and teachers at Shimna College you all hold the key to a peaceful and rich future and have a crucial part to play, especially in the coming months and years as Brexit unfolds.ldquoYou are the bridge builders and communicators of tomorrow.\"Judging from your school motto ndash learning from each other ndash the spirit of solidarity and friendship is already firmly rooted in your schoolrsquos DNA.She added: ldquoYour language skills will help ensure our countries remain close neighbours, good friends and vital partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Tasty.jpg","title":"Tasty double for Gainford  ","story":"THE East Down Foxhounds got the spring point-to-point season underway in cold, but dry conditions at David Corbettrsquos Tyrella estate on Saturday.Despite the cold, the meeting drew the largest attendance in years and also the biggest entry for the January meeting at the long-established venue.One man who will long remember the meeting is young Wexford jockey Jordan Gainford as he recorded his first ever double mdash it is also worth noting that his two winners under rules have come at Downpatrick and Down Royal.It was also a good day for Templepatrick owner trainer Warren Ewing, both his winners being ridden by Gainford.The first of these came in the second race of the day, the Armstrong Auctions  year-old geldings race.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health.

Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid.
