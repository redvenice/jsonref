Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar and donohoe in talks with aughinish alumina","story":"The Aughinish Alumina plant  on the Shannon estuary near Foynes, Co Limerick. It employs more than 400 workers and had payroll costs of €48.9m in 2020Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe have held talks with Aughinish Alumina on the future of the business amid concern that any EU sanctions against its Russian owners could jeopardise its Co Limerick operations.Aughinish is controlled by Moscow-based Rusal and its parent EN+, who have so far avoided EU penalties in the wave of measures imposed on Russian business since the Ukraine invasion began one month ago. But billionaire oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a key shareholder, was sanctioned in the last fortnight by the UK, and US penalties in 2018 led him to relinquish his majority stake. A major supplier to European industry, Aughinish has argued in contacts with the Government that any further sanctions on its owners would do more damage to large companies in France and Germany than to Russia. The plant turns imported bauxite into alumina, which is shipped to plants in Europe and smelted to make aluminium. “The Government is keen that the plant will continue to operate,” the Department of Enterprise said in response to questions. With a fifth round of penalties looming as EU leaders gather on Thursday for a Brussels summit on the war, the possibility of esting Aughinish Alumina from its parent is under examination. Accountants Grant Thornton are carrying out a strategic review of the business, which employs more than 400 workers and had payroll costs of €48.9 million in 2020.EN+ has stated previously that the possibility of “carving out” Rusal’s international business, which includes Aughinish Alumina, was under discussion. There was no reply, however, from any branch of the business when asked whether it was preparing a potential Aughinish sale or a transfer of ownership from Rusal. Emails to designated representatives went unanswered and one senior Aughinish figure hung up when called. Bank supportMr Varadkar and Mr Donohoe met Aughinish officials on Monday, according to the Department of Enterprise. The company sought the talks, it is understood. One question raised with Government figures is the possibility of Irish bank support for Aughinish if it is placed under new ownership.“There has been ongoing engagement between the Government, IDA Ireland and the company, including a meeting with the Tánaiste and Minister Donohoe,” the department said.“The department and its agencies continue to assess the implications of recent developments, and are closely monitoring the situation. The department understands the parent company is undertaking a strategic review with a view to protecting its operations.”Grant Thornton said: “Due to professional confidentiality we are not in a position to confirm or deny any client engagements.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Breaking news during Leaders’ Questions from the Minister for Public Expenditure, announcing a stunning departure for the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party coalition.“I want to assure you that the Government is at one,” Michael McGrath grandly declared.No wonder Mary Lou McDonald opened with “that’s an extraordinary response”. Fair dues, seldom is wonderful and congrats to all concerned on their achievement.Deputy McGrath wanted to be very clear about this exceptional development.“Minister Donohoe, myself and the entire Government, collectively, are at one . . .” he stressed again.All of them, singing from the same hymn sheet as part of Micheál Martin’s Merrion Street collective.“And we are keeping our ideas. On file. In a filing cabinet.” That’s what we expected the chartered accountant from Cork to say next because it would have sounded just perfect coming from him, but he didn’t.Not only did the Sinn Féin leader find this unexpected disclosure “extraordinary” but she also thought it “a very, very disappointing one”.Not because Opposition leaders love it when cross-party governments disagree but hate it when they claim to exist in perfect harmony. And not because Mary Lou thinks assertions that the Government is “at one” are entirely bogus because in her view any administration not run by Sinn Féin is permanently at sixes and sevens.No, she was very, very disappointed to hear Michael say that the Cabinet is in full agreement over future spending because it could only mean he is siding with the Minister for Finance, who announced he has no plans to introduce any more cost-of-living supports until the budget in October.Mary Lou reminded him what Paschal Donohoe said: “I can be really clear that we are not considering any further steps.”Seven months awayThis position will have to be revisited, she said, because October is seven months away “and people are trying to stay afloat now. They can’t wait that long”.Look at the rate of inflation, predicted to peak at 8.5 per cent in the summer – the highest since 1984 – while the war in Ukraine is further increasing inflationary pressure and adding to soaring prices.To underline the gravity of the difficult financial situation facing many workers, families and small businesses, Mary Lou went right back to 1969 and rejigged one of the most famous misquotes in Irish political history.“The Government cannot stand idly by while people are pushed into poverty,” she cried, borrowing from former Fianna Fáil taoiseach Jack Lynch’s speech in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bogside in Derry, when he promised the Irish government would “no longer stand by and see innocent people injured, and perhaps worse”.Somewhere along the way the word “idly” was inserted into the line and it stuck.The job of Government members is “to respond with speed and urgency to the extraordinary difficulties households now face,” said the Sinn Féin president, repeating the call she made to the Tánaiste on Tuesday for an immediate removal of VAT and excise duty on home heating oil.Not that easy, replied the Minister, standing in for the Taoiseach who was still cooling his heels in Washington, waiting for the Covid all-clear so he could get out of Dodge and make it to Brussels in time to join his fellow EU leaders for the crucial wartime European Council meeting.Micheál Martin finally got clearance to take off on Wednesday afternoon, thus ending his US confinement and raising the spirits of Opposition deputies struggling to get a rise out of his infuriatingly reasonable and unruffled Dáil understudy.‘Constantly monitoring’McGrath, while at pains to underline how united the Government is at this worrying time, stopped short of saying Paschal Donohoe’s intention not to bring in any more financial measures until October would be rigidly observed. It all depends. They are “constantly monitoring” the situation.But with Europe and Ireland now at crisis cliche level, it was incumbent upon him to note “these are unprecedented times” with people coping with inflation levels “without parallel in recent modern history” while “we are witnessing a perfect storm”.However, he informed Mary Lou, who could barely muster a heckle, never mind a disdainful bout of heavy sighs and eye-rolling, that his all-together Government has taken significant steps to alleviate the burden people are facing.He listed off the billions already spent and detailed various assistance packages and mentioned that “the stability programme update will be published” in the next few weeks, resetting our economic and fiscal forecasts to take account of the prevailing conditions we are experiencing. Then there is the volatile international situation over which the Government has little control.He also hinted that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are hoping to strike a bit of a deal with the European Commission on the VAT on home heating oil, while Micheál might come away with an extra few bob after the European Council.“That is why the Government is not standing idly by,” said McGrath. “I think, through our actions to date, we have demonstrated that the Government is agile and the Government is responsive”, which was more than could be said of Opposition speakers wilting under a soporific onslaught from the openly vanilla deputy for Cork South Central.Travel controlsA short time later, McDonald was up again to ask about the British government’s “disgraceful” plan to impose travel controls on non-Irish EU citizens “if they want to travel North to South or vice-versa”.She framed her question without once mentioning the Border, Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. Among other things, such a requirement would be devastating for the tourism sector.“All of us know when visitors come from, for example, the United States of America, they travel right across the island. And we could be faced, Ceann Comhairle, with the bizarre situation that should president Biden pay a visit to our island, he and his party might be required to register for permission to travel across the island.”Still, it’ll be such a treat for Joe to meet the Irish Taoiseach in the flesh at long last. Or Mihologram Martin, as the president knows him from their many virtual discussions.And such a treat for Micheál too, when he finally gets to shake hands with president Biden in lovely Turners Cross.“Top o’the marnin’ to ya, Mihologram! Is this Mayo? Are we in Mayo now?”It’s the least he deserves after a rotten run of luck."},{"url":null,"title":"sierra leonean students tackle lgbt rights and feminism through theatre","story":"Rehearsals for The Throne, the first live theatre performance in Sierra Leone in decades. Photograph: Sally HaydenThey cast three people in each role, on the assumption that two would drop out before the final performance, and rehearsed most nights on an old basketball court in a girls’ secondary school, without overhead lights. For the University of Sierra Leone Theatre Group, the show would go on.“Can’t miss this play redefining the views about gender, sexual orientation and power in Africa, ” read the advertisement for The Throne, which was performed for the first time to hundreds of people at Freetown’s City Hall in February and promoted as the “rebirth of theatre in Sierra Leone”.Some said it was the first live theatre performance in decades. A cast of about 30 rehearsed for months, contributing some of their own money to buy costumes and construct the set, and the final show included dancing, singing and drumming.It was sold out, leading to a second performance. Now, the cast is going on the road for a third, in the city of Makeni, in the west African coastal country’s north.“It is a big deal,” says Sarafina Nicolsesay, a 22-year-old mass communication graduate and the play’s narrator. “I think the culture has died for a long time . . . In Sierra Leone one of the struggles that we’ve had with marketing this event is most people are not interested in theatre.”Nicolsesay fell in love with acting as a child, listening to satirical radio programmes, and later began to watch shows such as Hamilton on YouTube. To join the theatre group, she had to ignore criticism from her mother, who saw acting as a waste of time because it wouldn’t earn her decent money. Staying involved has been an uphill battle.Many of the cast and crew were born during or since Sierra Leone’s civil war, which devastated the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. It again suffered through the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic. Local cultural activities – particularly theatre – have been a casualty, those involved in The Throne say, as many Sierra Leoneans haven’t learned to value them.Nicolsesay doesn’t know of a single functional theatre in her home country, but she hopes an industry can begin to develop. “Entertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,” she says, with clear enthusiasm.The plot of The Throne, written by Sierra Leonean writer Oumar Farouk Sesay, follows the demise of the king of the village of Norkorba. The only two people in the line of succession are his son – a married gay man who lives in the diaspora – or his daughter, who, as a woman, challenges the patriarchal structures that prop up the monarchy.“It’s going to be a culture shock to a lot of people, especially the part about the gay characters,” Nicolsesay says in advance of the opening performance. “The first time I heard the synopsis of it, I was like, Are you sure this is going to be cool, because we don’t have people who are out and proud in this country,” she says. “But that’s what we’re trying to show . . . you’re trying to get people to understand a certain type of subject that is taboo.”Homosexuality between men is illegal in Sierra Leone, and can, in theory, be punished with life imprisonment, though this has not been recently enforced.Nicolsesay says she hopes the play will start a conversation about feminism as well. “Women are always trying to go for leadership roles and they’ve been shut down, they’re always demoralised, and so that’s something that unfolds in the play as well.” Both topics are “pushing the boundaries”, she says.From October 2021, the young people rehearsed almost every night, passionate both about the story and the talent they wanted to display. “If it gets dark it doesn’t matter, we use our phone lights,” says Alvin Momoh, sitting on a bench at dusk, as he watches a full run-through. The fashion designer, who also works on a Sierra Leonean TV show called Slay Or Nay, helped organise the costumes. “Sometimes we stay late into the night.”Speaking after the first two performances, the play’s director, Bilal Jalloh, says there has been no negative reaction. “They love what we did,” he says, though “some people choose to reserve their opinions” on the plot.Martin Simah Jnr (23), who played the king’s gay son, says he did not invite friends and family to attend the initial performances because he was worried about their reaction. But he had his own revelation, finding the experience “wowing”. Performing the role helped him to understand both the discrimination same-sex couples face, as well as the “relevance of women in the political arena”, he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bone contention finally settled largest ever meat eating dinosaur","story":"The biggest meat-eating dinosaur to ever live, which dwarfed even the mighty T-Rex, was a river monster that ate car-sized fish, a study has found.Spinosaurus had a crocodile-like snout, measured around 50ft long, had stubby hind legs and a powerful tail. But there has been fierce debate over whether it was a genuine water-dweller or if it was a wader, plucking fish out the water like a grizzly bear does salmon.Analysis of fossilised remains show the dinosaur had extremely dense bones, similar to penguins and other aquatic animals, which the researchers claim prove it lived in water.“It was not a wader, or a heron-like animal, it was an animal that spent a lot of time submerged in the water,” Dr Nizar Ibrahim, the study author and a palaeontologist at the University of Portsmouth, told The .“The bones don\u0027t lie, density is a telltale sign of animals that spend an awful amount of time in the water.“The cool thing about dinosaurs is they are bizarre and alien-looking. People seek to find a modern day equivalent, but spinosaurus just don\u0027t have one.If you thought the monster shark in Jaws was scary, think again. The Spinosaurus was a real river monster.”Dr Ibrahim is convinced this finding, published in Nature, puts to bed any debate over whether the biggest dinosaur predator was terrestrial or marine-based. “If this doesn’t settle the debate, I’m not sure what else could possibly do it, except finding a fossil in a snorkelling kit,” he added.The fossils were found in the Sahara desert, as in the era of the dinosaurs it was not a barren wasteland, but a vast river network.“Spinosaurus lived in a giant river system with car-sized fish that ned the Sahara, from Egypt to Morocco. I call it the River of Giants,” said Dr Ibrahim.“It was the most dangerous place in the history of planet Earth.”He added that there were so many apex predators on the surface, that Spinosaurus managed to become the biggest by taking to the water and dominating the rivers.It is hard to date the dinosaur accurately by virtue of scarce remains, but the team believe they lived around 100 million years ago and may have gone extinct when a bout of global warming saw sea levels rise and the lake system become drowned by sea water, killing off the freshwater fish and, subsequently, Spinosaurus themselves.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says heRussia-Ukraine latest news: We could go after Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s gold, says Boris JohnsonExplained: The deadly chemical and biological weapons Russia could deploy in UkraineUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Britain agrees to send 6,000 missiles to UkraineTwo officers involved in Child Q strip search removed from frontline dutiesThursday morning news briefing: Public \u0026#39will turn on Conservatives\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont exercise outside says sadiq khan londons high pollution","story":"Londoners have been warned to limit their exercise outside as warm weather brings clouds of pollution from the continent.As temperatures reached 20C in the capital on Wednesday, older people and those with heart and lung problems were told to limit “strenuous physical exertion” due to high pollution levels.Anyone else “suffering discomfort” should also consider reducing their activity, official advice said.A forecast from Imperial College London said that levels of fine particulate pollution, or PM2.5, would reach “high” levels on Wednesday and Thursday, causing health problems for vulnerable people.The alert was the first issued by the Met Office since August 2020. Alerts were also broadcast in London train stations and to travellers at bus stops around the capital.Despite the health warning, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, also urged people to walk or cycle to limit the air pollution from vehicles.Government data from around the country shows that high pollution levels were also recorded in Yorkshire, including Leeds and Sheffield, and in Kent and Sunderland.The poor air quality is being caused by an area of high pressure which is pulling air carrying particles from the continent towards the UK, and also creating still conditions, meaning local air pollution is not being dispersed.The pollution risk will continue on Thursday with parts of the south east forecast to see “very high” levels, particularly in Essex and Norfolk, data from Defra and the Met Office show. At very high levels, everyone is advised to reduce outdoor exercise.The high pressure and resulting lack of cloud and wind is also leading to sunny, warm weather.Wednesday was the warmest day of the year so far, with a high of 20.8C recorded in St James\u0027s Park, London.Sarah Kent, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “We\u0027ve got high pressure across the country and across the south eastern corner of the UK that\u0027s drawing in a southeasterly breeze. It\u0027s very, very light, but it is drawing in continental air. There\u0027s often extra particulates tied in with that.“The other issue with high pressure is that because the wind is so light, the pollution we produce on a daily basis in our cities is not being dispersed, it\u0027s just sitting there.”Warm weather will continue into the weekend, though Tuesday and Wednesday are likely to be the warmest days this week, with colder weather predicted from Monday, she added.Gardeners could still expect to see some ground frost in the coming days and the north of Scotland will also experience patchy rain and cloud.The European pollution comes in part from farmers on the continent ploughing or spraying, the Met Office said.“High” pollution levels mean that the concentration of PM2.5 is between 54 and 70 micrograms per cubic metre as an average over the day.PM2.5 is one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and cancers.In the short term it can exacerbate symptoms for people who have health problems linked to breathing.“Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms,” official Government advice says, adding that older people should also reduce physical exertion.Anyone else who is “experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors,” it adds.Mr Khan said: “I’m urging Londoners to look after each other by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport, avoiding unnecessary car journeys, stopping engine idling and not burning wood or garden waste, all of which contributes to high levels of pollution.“This is particularly important in order to protect those who are more vulnerable to high pollution.“While this alert is in place people with heart and lung problems should avoid physical exertion.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: We could go after Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s gold, says Boris JohnsonPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says heExplained: The deadly chemical and biological weapons Russia could deploy in UkraineUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Britain agrees to send 6,000 missiles to UkraineTwo officers involved in Child Q strip search removed from frontline dutiesThursday morning news briefing: Public \u0026#39will turn on Conservatives\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret life alina kabaeva star gymnast became putins eva braun","story":"Beautiful, talented and with an Olympic gold medal to her name, Alina Kabaeva was once regarded as the most eligible woman in Moscow. Today, though, she has a rather less desirable epithet, as “Russia’s Eva Braun”.Kabaeva, 38, is the former gymnast turned politician who is widely believed to be the girlfriend, or possibly the wife, of Vladimir Putin. She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: We could go after Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s gold, says Boris JohnsonPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says heExplained: The deadly chemical and biological weapons Russia could deploy in UkraineUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Britain agrees to send 6,000 missiles to UkraineTwo officers involved in Child Q strip search removed from frontline dutiesThursday morning news briefing: Public \u0026#39will turn on Conservatives\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories dont deserve survive keep treating voters like fools","story":"It is the first lesson of politics: don’t take your voters for fools. Don’t pretend to cut taxes when you are raising them. Don’t claim you are prioritising collapsing living standards when you are not.The cost of living crisis is a global phenomenon, and the ability of politicians to counteract it is limited in the short term. But the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, still had a choice: he could have pledged not to make this inflationary tornado any worse. He could have ditched his manifesto-breaking National Insurance increase. He could have removed some of the taxes pushing up gas and electricity prices. He could have announced a review into the Bank of England’s inflation-targeting performance.He chose instead to push ahead with most of his tax increases, clinging to an obsolete orthodoxy that directly adds to the cost of living crisis, while desperately seeking to camouflage the true nature of his actions. When he did act, it was by helping workers on lower incomes, loading even more of the burden onto the Conservative Party’s electoral base.He decided to prioritise the ersatz version of conservatism he has felt he needed to make his own: a high-spending, high-taxing, debt-reducing, budget-balancing model of the economy, accompanied by inducements for firms to invest and train more to boost productivity. The debt to GDP ratio is predicted to fall from 95.6 per cent of GDP this year to 83.1 per cent by 2026-27 despite Covid: it is that, bizarrely, which Sunak appears to believe will be his legacy.Yet the Chancellor, hemmed in by Boris Johnson’s social democratic vision for Britain, has made the wrong call, with disastrous consequences for his party – and his own career. Because Johnson didn’t allow him to be a small-state conservative, Sunak reinvented himself as a low-debt Tory. He was right to predict that debt interest costs would surge – by four times, it turned out. But fiscal conservatism isn’t morally, economically or electorally equivalent to low-tax conservatism. It isn’t the real deal.Abstract aggregates such as GDP don’t matter to voters: what counts is whether they are better or worse off in terms of purchasing power. On that metric, the year ahead will be the worst anybody can remember. It will be catastrophic, appalling, and could destroy the Conservative Party and its reputation for economic competence for a generation.Real household disposable income will fall by 2.2 per cent, the greatest drop in living standards in any year since records began in 1956-57. The hit is worse than during the IMF bailout of the 1970s, worse than after the ERM crisis, 911, Lehman Brothers, and (thanks to massive intervention) worse even than Covid.That is the backdrop to Sunak’s decision not to cancel the NIC rise. He needed to do far more to show that he was taking the public’s pain – including Middle England’s – seriously. What is the point of a lower national debt if it gets Labour elected, who then finish off what is left of the economy and borrow more anyway?Sunak never set off to do this, but his role as Johnson’s CFO has made him responsible for helping complete Britain’s transition to a low-growth, high tax economy. The numbers are horrifying.Even after Sunak’s modest, performative tax relief, the tax to GDP ratio will have increased by 3.3 percentage points of GDP by 2025-6 compared with 2019-20. The overall tax burden will surge from 33 per cent of GDP to 36.3 per cent, the highest since Clement Attlee’s hard-Left administration in the 1940s. Public spending will have increased by 2.1 per cent of GDP, to levels last reached sustainably in the 1970s. This is what a technocratic Labour government would do, minus the wealth taxes and the class warfare. Sunak’s smoke and mirrors performance wasn’t especially elaborate. The increase in the personal allowance cancels out only a third of the rise in National Insurance contributions. In total, the Spring Statement offset just a sixth of the tax hikes previously introduced by Sunak, dropping to a tenth without the hypothetical 1p cut to income tax that may or may not happen in 2024. This particular move is the least generous income tax reduction that it is possible to make: it would reduce the tax burden by 0.2 per cent of GDP, far less than the sums raised by freezing the personal allowance. By contrast, Nigel Lawson slashed the top rate of tax by 20 percentage points: that is what real Tory Budgets look like.Even at a time of maximum pain, green fundamentalism remains de rigeur. The Treasury maintains it would be wrong to cut VAT on fuel to zero, a Brexit promise originally made by Johnson, because it would make the tax system more complex. Instead, it suddenly decided that it was in fact possible to cut VAT to zero – but only on insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Like Milton Friedman, I never say no to a tax cut, but the cant is breathtaking. The fuel duty tax cut was great, but oversold in a way that would have made Gordon Brown blush – the Chancellor claimed that it would save taxpayers £5 billion but the real figure is £2.4 billion.I remain very fond of Sunak, a brilliant and substantial figure. He is an unwilling social democrat, taken hostage by a neo-Heseltinian Prime Minister. I hope he will eventually be able to be himself again. His decision to align the National Insurance and income tax personal allowances is a great piece of tax simplification. He valiantly resisted numerous bad ideas. He didn’t increase Universal Credit. He did not increase spending on public services despite the rise in inflation, ensuring a large real terms cut. It may be by stealth, but this is the kind of diet our bloated state must immediately be put on.Yet Sunak made a terrible mistake by not scrapping his NIC hike, and an even worse one by defying Boris Johnson when the PM was at his weakest, forcing him to stick to this daft, destructive policy. He was reduced to spending his Spring Statement tinkering and tweaking. What’s the point of hiking NICs and then cutting income tax?It is likely that the voters will turn on the Tories as the cost of living crisis intensifies. If so, we must hope that Johnson doesn’t choose to make Sunak his scapegoat.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: We could go after Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s gold, says Boris JohnsonPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak defends Spring Statement and says heExplained: The deadly chemical and biological weapons Russia could deploy in UkraineUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Britain agrees to send 6,000 missiles to UkraineTwo officers involved in Child Q strip search removed from frontline dutiesThursday morning news briefing: Public \u0026#39will turn on Conservatives\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"12 nasty details hidden small","story":" nasty details hidden in the small print of Rishi Sunaks tax-cutting Spring StatementRishi Sunak today trumpeted fuel duty cuts and a change to National Insurance tax thresholds in his Spring Statement .

That’s despite Brits facing the worst cost-of-living shock since records began nearly YEARSago as inflation rockets to .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war. In a bombshell aposrabbit out of the hatapos, he promised to cut the basic rate of income tax from p to p in the pound - but not now, only in April  in an election bribe. With Iceland’s boss today saying food bank users are “declining potatoes and root veg because they canapost afford the energy to boil them”, are today’s announcements enough to stop us hitting the iceberg  You won’t be surprised that an avalanche of campaigners are telling us - no.  And even the great achievements the Chancellor has announced have some pretty unpleasant small print behind them.From the awkward truth about the fuel duty cut to the impact on Universal Credit claimants who face a cost-of-living disaster, we round up some of the small print Rishi Sunak doesn’t want you to see. Fuel duty cut will save you just £. a month -you driveFuel duty will be cut by p a litre from pm tonight until March . The Chancellor said itaposs the biggest cut ever and Treasury boasted it will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier.But it will only knock £ off the cost of a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it’ll save the typical driving household only £ a year. And evengarages pass it on in full, it will only reverse % of the rise in pump prices over the last year. Petrol prices have gone up p in seven days - so Sunak’s big tax cut takes us back to…. last week. Universal Credit claimants will see half their ‘gains’ wiped outIn his big-ticket announcement, Rishi Sunak raised the threshold at which you start paying National Insurance by £, to £,. The people who gain the most from this are people on minimum-wage jobs who earn £, a year. They’re taken out of paying NI altogether. But these people are often also on Universal Credit - and that’s a problem, because they’re are taxed dferently to other people. For every £ of extra earnings they take home after tax, p of their benefits will be “tapered” away under Universal Credit rules, giving them a p net gain. Sothey gain £ by being taken out of National Insurance, Universal Credit rules suggest they may only keep £. of that.Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis told the BBC : “By increasing the NI threshold which increases people’s net disposable income, because of the way Universal Credit works, anyone on Universal Credit will only get half the gain of the National Insurance rise. I should state I’m double checking that… but I think that is what is likely to happen.”A massive stealth hit will force .million more Brits to pay income taxThe Chancellor crowed about hiking the National Insurance threshold. But the wage where you start paying income tax - £, - is being frozen for four years from this April. That will mean a whopping .million more Brits will be dragged into paying income tax by  , as their wages cross over the £, line. Soaring inflation means twice as many people will be dragged into paying income tax compared to what the forecasters thought last year. IFS director Paul Johnson said: “The freezing of the income tax personal allowance and higher rate threshold turn out to be much bigger tax rises than first intended. “As a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been paying without this parliament’s reforms”.Poorest households gain less than richest onesThe Treasury produced a table of gains ‘since ’ to households based on income, that suggested the poorest tenth will be just over £, better off. But the Resolution Foundation warned £ in every £ of support is going to the richest half of households. The think tank said the poorest fth of households will gain just £ from todayaposs Spring Statement - compared to £ for middle earners and £ for the wealthiest. That’s because the poorest people already aren’t paying much in National Insurance or fuel duty, the two taxes that have seen a cut today. Nor are they doing things like installing solar  on their home, which also saw a tax cut.Graduates are being absolutely hammered The small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.Repayment thresholds are being frozen this April. And students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold now. Meanwhile theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . All this will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years, the OBR revealed. For context, that compares to £.bn a yearthat Brits will gain once income tax is cut from p to p in the pound from April .Benefits will lose £bn in value… while Sunak tops up by £mRishi Sunak announced he was doubling the Household Support Fund for councils to help Brits in dire straits, from £m to £bn. Yet that’s left in the shade by a £BILLION fall in the real value of benefits in -, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. This is because benefits are rising at just .% while inflation is expected to top out at .% in the last three months of this year. The way benefits are calculated suggests that’ll trigger a bumper rise in April , but that’s cold comfort to claimants now. The OBR wanted it will take benefits “up to  months to catch up fully with higher inflation”. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year.But is there still more cash to hunt benefit fraudsters than tax dodgers Two paragraphs next to each other in the Spring Statement small print may raise eyebrows. Paragraph . promises £m over the next five years to “increase compliance and debt management capacity” in HM Revenue and Customs. Paragraph . restates a pledge for £m to “increase DWP’s capacity and capability to detect fraud and error, and collect more debt”. It comes after benefit fraud and error exploded in Covid times and it’s set to recover £.bn. But many will be worried about the focus on benefits as opposed to tax dodgers.Savings are set to plunge to a record lowThe hike in interest rates should - in theory - help you get a betteron savings. But you need savings in the first place for that. Household savings could hit a record low in  as families are forced to delve into their reserves as the cost of living crisis hits, the OBR said. The watchdog predicted that the saving ratio will drop to .% by the start of  as inflation eats into wages. The household saving ratio reached a record high of nearly % during lockdown early in the pandemic, with families saving around £bn more between the start of  and the latter half of , than in the comparable period before Covid hit. The OBR said the new era of austerity would mean households dip into their savings are are less able to put cash aside.Bulb Energy bailout to cost taxpayers almost £bnWhen Bulb Energy - which has .m customers - last year faced going into administration, the Government stepped in with a £.bn bailout. Ministers at the time described the cash as a loan but the fiscal watchdog today confirms the bailout will in fact cost the taxpayer more than £bn. The OBR says: The government’s bailout of Bulb Energy incurs a £.bn cost in - and a further £bn in -, to cover the company’s operating losses. Given the volatility in global energy markets, there remains uncertainty around the final cost.Departmental budgets take a battering from inflation tooSpiking inflation also has a crippling knock-on effect for the government cash available for public services. Rishi Sunak confirmed the governmentaposs departmental budgets - which covered everything from the Ministry of Justice to councils to transport - in his spending review last year in cash terms. But due to inflation those budgets have now shrunk.The OBR predicts that there is now between £bn and £bn less in resources available for services - and that the NHS accounts for around a quarter of that. Today’s help wipes out just a fraction of tax risesRishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor before the next election, but only just. The OBR watchdog found all the previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%. Brexit red tape is hurting trade Hidden in the small print of the OBR report is the revelation that Brexit red tape still appears to be hitting Britainaposs trade.The OBR said that the UK saw a similar collapse in exports as other countries at the start of the pandemic - but was missing out as global trading levels began to recover at the end of . It adds: The UK appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling % since , two and a half times more than in any other G country.

Ministers attended eight meetings with testing firm Randox - twice as many as previously disclosed - but kept minutes for just two, according to the National Audit Office’s investigation. The firm and its strategic partner Qnostics Ltd were handed £. million with of contracts - % of which were awarded without competition under emergency procurement rules. The firm had former Tory MP Owen Paterson on their payroll as a consultant. And documents released last month revealed he had personally lobbied then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the firm - and asking him to kill news stories making claims about his involvement with the initial £m deal. Before the NAO’s report today, the government had admitted to four ministerial meetings with Randox since the start of the pandemic.  But the NAO identied a further four where the Department of Health and Social Carehad failed to record Randox’s attendance on official transparency releases. They also found documents which “indicated” one-to-one telephone calls between ministers - including Mr Hancock and former le sciences minister Lord Bethell - and representatives of Randox, including Mr Paterson.  DHSC could not confirm to the NAO whether the calls took place, or any notes from the discussions. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: Even taking these exceptional circumstances into account, the documentation of the decision-making process for such large contracts was inadequate.”  Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee added: Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. While the body found no evidence contracts were handed out improperly, the gaps in records meant they were not able to provide positive assurance in the normal way.” The report read: “This report should not be considered as offering positive assurance over any of these contracts which are not detailed in the report or as offering any legal opinion on the use of public procurement regulations.” Despite this, Mr Hancock claimed the report had given ministers a “clean bill of health”, adding “the report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing.” The report noted Mr Hancock had used private email and WhatsApp to discuss Randox with Mr Paterson. He did not disclose all the messages to DHSC officials at the time, telling investigators he did not believe they were “substantive” discussions, and he was not required to do so under Cabinet Office rules. He later made his phone available to investigators and to the department.The report also notes the Information Commissioner is investigating the use of private correspondence channels at DHSC, but has yet to publish its report. DHSC was “unable to provide” key evidence to investigators about decision making - and because notes were not recorded in the department’s existing systems, they had to search several officials’ email accounts to find it. “The Department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other signicant aspects of the procurement,” the report reads. “Including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contact award, and considering of potential conflicts of interest.” Records seen by the NAO suggest officials did not think conflicts of interest rules applied to emergency direct awards. “This reflects an incorrect understanding of the relevant regulations,” the report reads. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: “Mr Hancock warmly welcomes this thorough report by the NAO, which confirms a total clean bill of health on Ministers’ work with Randox during the pandemic. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing - just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity. While the department will no doubt reflect on the technical issues that need to be addressed, the report sets out that Ministers and Officials in the Department were doing their very best to save lives in what was a quick moving and unprecedented situation. Mr Hancockaposs thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones.  Ms Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat. “Over % of testing contracts were awarded to ‘high priority’ companies, including those referred by ministers, MPs or Number . The public needs to trust that their taxes are spent on the basis that it’s what you know, not who you know. “As with many of the COVID response schemes, lessons must be learned about delivering at speed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppNational Audit OfficeLord BethellGareth DaviesOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonMeg HillierPoliticsSolar powerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is expected to tell Brits how the Government will help them get through the looming cost of living crisis. He has hinted he may cut fuel duty by up to p per litre, with forecourt prices soaring since Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine.The Labour leader backed the move – and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to drive down soaring energy bills.He said: “Everybody is talking about how they’re feeling the pinch. They want to know that the Government is hearing them, that it’s going to do something about it”. He added: “I think the simple things are a windfall tax on oil and gas companies who’ve made more profit than they expected, use that to bring down bills.  “If the Government is going to actually do something about fuel duties, then, of course, we will support that because I think, for most people, this is such a dficult situation.” As households and businesses struggle, No  admitted that the Government’s energy security strategy had been delayed again to next week. Mr Starmer also said a planned National Insurance rise was the “wrong tax at the wrong time”.There is speculation Mr Sunak could scrap the rise for lower-paid workers by raising the threshold it starts to be paid at. The Resolution Foundation said boosting benefits would bring nearly four times more support to lower-earning families than scrapping the NI rise. It emerged last night pensions could rise by more than % in April  after the DWP insisted it “remains committed” to bringing back the triple lock – despite inflation rising.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey will base the increase on average wages, .%, or September’s CPI inflation figure – whichever is highest.It will likely bring a bumper rise for pensioners next spring - but only after hefty real-terms cuts this year. The Resolution Foundation has said inflation could hit .% by September, higher than last year though still below a peak next month of .%. That would lead to a pensions rise of £ a week.  But the think-tank blasted the “rollercoaster ride” and urged ministers to ease pressure now Parents are also being squeezed by rising childcare costs and a drop in places, according to the charity Coram Family and Childcare. It found the UK-average price of  hours of care a week for an under two in nursery is £.. More than one in five people fear financial pressures will drive them into problem debt this year, debt charity StepChange found. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth claimed energy price rises will cause low earners and retirees to either “starve or freeze”. Below are six announcements expected on Wednesday: p fuel duty cut predictedFuel duty was frozen in October’s Budget for a th year in a row. But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is “vital” it is now reduced as prices soar due to the Ukraine war. Mr Sunak has hinted it could be cut – amid speculation of p a litre. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour will not vote against a cut but warned that p may not “rise to the scale of the challenge”.Inflation set to peak at .% Inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it even worse. Officials fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of . Some warn it could hit %. This will blow out of the water October’s forecasts that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .%. It will mean more expensive food and goods, hitting the poorest hardest. National insurance to rise to .% National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April and will be paid by anyone earning over £, a year, up from the £, a year it is paid at now. There’s speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, taking some of the lowest earners out of paying. One Tory said: “If it’s about pride, they can now say Ukraine is the reason they need to change course.”Benefits to go up by .% Benefits will go up just .%, as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October the Chancellor cut UC for millions by £ a week.Pensions will also rise by .%.

The highest inflation in  years and the worst income squeeze on record lie ahead of us.While household finances are taking a hammering, the public finances have actually been on the up: we’re all paying more taxes than the Government expected. Using that headroom, the Chancellor today prioritised rebuilding his tax cutting credentials over support for the low-to-middle income households hardest hit. A p cut to fuel duty will save the typical driving households £ a year, but only reverse  per cent of the increase in pump prices over the past year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section An increase in how much you can earn before you start paying National Insurance will be welcome relief for many, but middle and top income households will gain the most. In fact only £ in every £ of new support goes to the poorer half of families.

Families are facing a devastating a cost of living crisis. And the Chancellor could have helped them out, by scrapping his tax rise on jobs.He could have introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household energy bills. He could have finally brought forward a plan to support British business and create good jobs. That’s what a Labour Government would have delivered. But instead, years of Tory tax rises means that after today the OBR say that we will still have the highest tax burden in  years. Not only that, April will now bring the biggest fall in family incomes since records began.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Even with the Chancellor’s cynical changes, he’s only shaving £ off every £ he’s taxing people. This simply isn’t going to cut it as inflation spirals out of control. Britain’s people needs a government on their side. Instead, we have one that wants to raise taxes and leave working people paying the price. Come April, a landlord with a large number of properties or someone who makes huge sums from buying and selling stocks and shares won’t be paying any more in tax, but their tenants will.

The Conservatives are the party of high taxes, because they are the party of low growth and wasteful spending. The promise of crumbs in two years’ time will be of little comfort to families struggling to pay the bills today. It is timed to suit the Tory party’s interests, not the national interest.

It is meant to provide “organic airborne surveillance and control capability”.  The other is the £.bn Armoured Cavalry programme for  Ajax fighting vehicles. Just  have been delivered and they have given troops hearing problems. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “As NATO leaders meet to respond to Russian aggression, ministers are failing to equip our armed forces with the full kit and equipment to fight and fulfil our NATO obligations.“The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department with no major programme set for delivery on time and on budget, while at least £bn has also been wasted in taxpayers’ money since .“On day one, Labour in government would get the NAO to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value of Money’s tough regime on spending decisions.” Projects in the NAO’s -page “Departmental Overview of the Ministry of Defence”, published last month, have come under fresh scrutiny amid Russia ’s war with Ukraine.Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has triggered tomorrowaposs emergency summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where the Prime Minister is expected to welcome new defence spending pledges by allies - and urge counterparts to go further in supporting Kyiv.But details uncovered by Labour reveal the extent to which Mr Johnson should be worried about defence procurement at home. Multibillion-pound deals are rated in one of five colour-coded categories.  According to Whitehall’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority, green means “successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery signicantly”. But that does not apply to any of the MoD’s schemes. Twelve are given the amber red rating, meaning “successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. “Urgent action is needed to address these problems and or assess whether resolution is feasible.” Fourteen are rated amber, meaning “successful delivery appears feasible but signicant issues already exist, requiring management attention. “These appear resolvable at this stage and,addressed promptly, should not present a cost schedule overrun.” An MoD spokesman said: “Our latest available figures show the majority of MoD’s major projects are capable of being delivered on time and in budget. “We are making the largest investment in our armed forces since the end of the Cold War, with an additional £bn helping ensure they have the equipment they need to meet future threats.” It is understood the most up-to-date figures show % of the MoD’s Government Major Projects Portfolio are rated as amber or better, with problems that,addressed promptly, should not trigger extra costs or delays.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians. He seems to resent helping to keep factories open and Brits in work, sohe pulls POaposs freeport contracts on the basis itaposs fired a third of its UK workforce and employed Filipinos on £ an hour, realism itself will seek the therapistaposs couch.There are global, and dficult, economic problems to resolve. It requires someone with empathy, experience, and imagination to tackle them. Instead this chancellor will do tiny things - bijou cashbacks, petite lies, small-minded solutions that solve nothing. Thataposs why heaposs Little Rishi - thinks little, knows little, does little. The Spring Statement will be nothing more than Torynomics - bedtime stories from a man whose only real goal in le is to replace the party-mad pillock in Number , rather than nurse a nation back to economic health.Youaposll never get any financial sense from a man who spends £ on a coffee cup and £ on slippers.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyConservative PartyBPEuropean UnionNHSBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTaxEnergy billsOil pricesWar crimesCrimePoliticsSolar powerRishi SunakThe BudgetSpring Statement\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a ‘ stealth tax ’ squeeze on the cost of living.  The Mirror understands officials are braced for inflation to peak above % this Spring, with formal forecasts due to be produced tomorrow.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre and is said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax.But heaposs resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike entirely - or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis warned on Sunday: “I am virtually out of tools to help people now.  “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.” So as we wait for Tory Rishi Sunak to deliver any help, let’s look at the biggest cost-of-living hikes he needs to deal with - and the dates they’ll hit. InflationDATE: NOWUK CPI inflation has already hit .%, raising the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades.The war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine is now making this worse, with officials now braced for inflation to peak above % in April.It will mean the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point where firms could go bust. The Resolution Foundation expects inflation to remain high for most of this year and still be above % in September - a level not seen since the early s.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW Last week the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. Petrol pricesDATE: NOWPetrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, leading Chancellor Rishi Sunak to hint he’ll temporarily cut fuel duty.The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier.But Labour warned even a rumoured p-a-litre cut would make a dference of only a couple of quid to a family tank.And Mr Sunak would face pressure to make any cut permanent, despite Tories having frozen the duty for  years already while raising taxes on everything .Energy billsDATE: April The energy price cap will increase to a record £,-a-year for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. Tory MPs say he must go further - for instance by increasing the £ discount or £ loan, or delaying repayments. But he was reluctant to announce help before April .  National Insurance riseDATE: April A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above £, a year, a rise from % to .%. This earnings threshold has risen since last year, but only by .% - less than inflation. The Lib Dems brand this a stealth tax that makes Brits pay £ more.Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more.But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. While Rishi Sunak is unlikely to scrap the rise completely, there are claims he could change the earnings threshold - for instance, aligning it with income tax . Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . And that was analysed before the latest rises in inflation. The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought.  Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April Inflation means many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by rising prices. At this rate workers will need a rise of % to % just to keep up with rising prices, but the government is resisting these. Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.  Council tax riseDATE: April  Most of England’s families will be hit with a Council Tax rise of % or more next Friday, Mirror research reveals. Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Covid testsDATE: April From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.Boots is preparing to charge £ for a pack of five. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  Real terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last September, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use climbing. The Resolution Foundation has urged Rishi Sunak to raise benefits more generously as an urgent priority, ahead of any decision to cancel the National Insurance rise. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation. Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict. A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOWPoor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As he announced one £m fund MPs shouted: Is that it  IFS think tank director Paul Johnson warned perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing, adding: He has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. Their benefits will rise by just .% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by %.”The Chancellor announced cuts to fuel duty and National Insurance - the latter being a tax heaposs hiking at exactly the same time.He also promised to cut income tax from p to p in the pound in April , just in time for a general election. But there was almost no help for those out of work, and nothing to improve the level of benefits. The Resolution Foundation said the poorest fth of households will gain just £ from todayaposs Spring Statement - compared to £ for middle earners and £ for the wealthiest. Alicia Kennedy, Director of Generation Rent, said: “We are in a dangerous moment with millions about to be plunged into fuel poverty and people already in poverty facing desperate choices between heating and eating.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “In the midst of the biggest wages and bills crisis in living memory, Rishi Sunak’s Spring Statement has failed families who need help now. “We did not get the urgent help with soaring bills that families need. And the rise in the national insurance threshold will mostly benefit better off households. “The Spring Statement small print shows that pay packets are now expected to fall in value by £ a week this year. After  years of Tory government, Britain needs a pay rise. But this Chancellor has no plan to get wages rising and give working people long-term financial security.”  Tax Justice UK Executive Director, Robert Palmer, said: “The Chancellor used his Spring Statement to campaign for an election in two years, while millions wonder what theyaposll have to eat in two days.” Michael Clarke of debt charity Turnus said: “We’re already hearing how many household budgets simply can’t stretch anymore. he next  months will result in thousands of people facing impossible choices between keeping a roof over their heads or feeding their children to survive.” Here are some of the biggest crises coming down the track to you - and what,anything, Rishi Sunak announced to help.InflationDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:UK CPI inflation hit .% in February. The Budget watchdog now says itaposll rocket to an average of .% this year - and could peak at nearly % thanks to the Ukraine-Russia war.That -year high will mean the pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point firms could go bust. It means real household disposable income set to fall .% this year - the biggest since records began in .WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor cut fuel duty, raised National Insurance thresholds and increased a Household Support Fund in what the Treasury claimed was £.bn of help. But it wonapost help the poorestand he admitted he canapost stop the tide of inflation. Mr Sunak said: “The OBR have not accounted for the full impacts go the war in Ukraine and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen - potentially signicantly”.The IFS think tank warned even with everything put together, a middle earner on £, can still expect to be £ worse off this year than last year.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Last week the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor had his hands tied on this one as interest rates are decided independently by the Bank of England.There was no new help for homeowners in the Spring Statement, apart from knocking the % VAT off green home improvements like solar , insulation and heat pumps. Meanwhile the Bank rate rise has knocked £bn off the public finances by making borrowing more expensive, wiping out the National Insurance rise in one fell swoop. Petrol pricesDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Petrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia ’s war in Ukraine. The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Fuel duty will be cut by p a litre from pm tonight until March .The Chancellor said itaposs the biggest cut ever and the Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier. But it will still only knock around £ off a -litre tank for a family car. The Resolution Foundation said it will save the typical driving households £ a year, but evenpassed on in full by garages, it will only reverse % of the increase in pump prices over the past year.Energy billsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:The energy price cap will increase to a record £,-a-year for a typical household. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April .A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October .WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED: Rishi Sunak previously announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ repayable rebate off energy bills in October.But he announced no new cash help in the Spring Statement today - despite speculation he was going to raise the £ or delay the date to start repaying it beyond April .  National Insurance riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING: A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above the threshold, a rise from % to .%.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year.Of all the cost of living rises facing Brits this is the one Rishi Sunak came closest to sorting out today. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax . This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has accused Rishi Sunak of “making an historic mistake” by failing to scrap a tax hike on jobs, warning families will “endure signicant hardship” within days.Officials are also confident that inflation is so high, there will still be more National Insurance coming in overall - despite thresholds being raised today. Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year.According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Rishi Sunak announced no changes to the thresholds today despite a campaign to do so. The National Insurance thresholds are more generousbut income tax remain frozen.The IFS said as a result, almost all workers will be paying more tax on their earnings in  than they would have been - even when todayaposs tax cuts are taken into account. Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Inflation means many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by rising prices.Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no extra cash for public sector wage rises. They are already having to be funded out of departmentsapos existing budgets - those did not rise today.Royal College of Nursing General Secretary Pat Cullen said: “Nursing feel extremely short-changed by this statement. The cost-of-living crisis means some are having to choose between filling up their cars and feeding their children. Todayaposs fuel measures are not enough to stop nursing staff subsidising the NHS when they fill up their car.  Council tax riseDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Most of England’s families will be hit with the maximum Council Tax next Friday, Mirror research reveals. Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% or higher.Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to the council tax bills and no increase to the £. Councils were however given another £million to help the hardest-up families via the Household Support Fund - doubling it to £bn.The Local Government Association said the cash was welcome, but warned pressure on councils is signicant andthis continued pressure cannot be met by council tax rises alone - suggesting more local cuts are in the offing.

VAT s to % in pubs and restaurantsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:From April  VAT willback to % in pubs and restaurants, and other hospitality venues - inevitably raising the prices for punters while inflation is already raging.The VAT rate had been cut due to the Covid pandemic and despite the cost of living squeeze, itaposs ing to the full rate as planned. WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED: Rishi Sunak announced nothing to stop the VAT hike. UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls said: “Locking in VAT at .% would have given hospitality businesses a major boost, and helped the sector in its ambition to lead the UK back to post-Covid prosperity.As it is, thousands of jobs could be lost, the UK will remain uncompetitive versus international rivals, and already hard-pressed consumers in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis will see price rises in their favourite pubs, bars and restaurants, further fuelling inflation. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped.The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Nothing for the student finance system or graduates repaying loans. Quite the contrary - the small print of Budget forecasts shows the long-term changes to the student loan system will net tens of billions for the Chancellor.It will save the public finances £.bn in   and an average of £.bn a year over the following years.  Massive real-terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But inflation has since doubled to .%. This will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use soaring as food prices in the supermarket rise by a predicted %.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:The Chancellor announced no changes to benefits despite speculation he could tweak work allowances in Universal Credit.His allies claimed he didnapost need to act again after raising work allowances and cutting the taper rate in the last Budget. But these measures only help people in work - as do most of the measures announced today, too. Once again, those who cannot work due to sickness or other reasons are left behind. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April  WHATaposS HAPPENING:Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation.Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:Like above, Rishi Sunak announced nothing extra to help pensioners today.Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation said: “The increase in the household support fund and changes to the National Insurance threshold are welcome, but there will still be many families on the lowest incomes who are very anxious about the cost of living, particularly rising energy bills.” A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOW WHATaposS HAPPENING:Poor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation.Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April.WHAT SUNAK ANNOUNCED:You now the message by now - there was no change to this. Nor was there help for the childcare sector or schools more generally, beyond what was announced in the Autumn.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It is extremely disappointing that the Chancellor has once again ignored the serious financial challenges facing schools within his spring statement. “Like every household and business, schools are facing crippling rises in energy costs, to be funded from already stretched budgets.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Sunak raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance by £, to £, - claiming itaposd save Brits up to £ a year. But this doesnapost factor in a . percentage point rise in the same tax that heaposs already announced. This will cut into the £ saving, and outstrip it entirely for anyone earning over £, a year. He also announced a p a litre one-year cut in fuel duty - but this doesnapost help people who donapost have a car. And he announced a tax cut for richer Brits who spend thousands sticking solar  on their homes to save the planet. In a bombshell election vow aposrabbit out of the hatapos, he promised to cut the basic rate of income tax from p to p in the pound - but not now, only in April  in an election bribe.There are serious questions about how itaposll be funded, as while Mr Sunak could have over £bn of spare aposheadroomapos, officials admit even slight changes in the economy will knock billions off Treasury funds.  The Chancellor was blasted for ignoring the poorest as the income tax and National Insurance changes donapost give a penny to Brits out of work. There was no increase to benefits as poverty-stricken families face a cost of living disaster, with inflation rising twice as fast as welfare and pensions.MPs shouted is that it  as he announced just £m for a Household Support Fund - which supports poverty-stricken Brits who fall through the cracks of current schemes. There was also no extra cash for defence despite the war in Ukraine and falling troop numbers, and no extra support for soaring energy bills. Officials claimed the measures announced today amount to £.bn of support for the cost of living. That is a £bn cut through National Insurance thresholds, £bn cut from fuel duty, and the £m extra for the Household Support Fund. That was on top of £bn set out previously, bringing total support next year to £bn. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said real household disposable incomes per person will fall by .% in   - the largest fall in a single year since ONS records began in .  It is only the ninth fall in real disposable incomes recorded since records began nearly  years ago. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves fumed: The Chancellor has made the wrong choices. She said it was just jam tomorrow, rather than the support that is needed now adding: He’s not Nigel Lawson - he’s Ted Heath with an Instagram account!” She compared the Chancellor to Alice in Wonderland, blasting: We are presented with increasingly incredible claims. Perhaps the Chancellor has been taking inspiration from the characters in Alice in Wonderland. Or should I say – ‘Alice in Sunakland’, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jon Ashworth added: “Thanks to the Conservatives’ choices, families and retirees will still face the biggest hit to household incomes on record.” The bullet points below arenapost an exhaustive list of everything hitting you because some measures - like the minimum wage and cigarette and alcohol taxes - were already announced in the Budget.They also donapost cover some of the biggest cost-of-living hits coming next month which the Chancellor did nothing to address. Weaposve rounded those up here. Are todayaposs announcements enough to support struggling families  Let us know:mirror.money.saving@mirror Tax and wages Threshold where workers start paying National Insurance will be raised by £, to £, - outstripping this Aprilaposs . percentage point hike in the tax for % of workers Chancellor claims it could be worth £ a year - but that doesnapost include the amount the tax is going up by at the same time The aposbreak evenapos point where the tax hike will wipe out the £ saving you make from todayaposs change is around £-,-a-year of salary Change ONLY applies to employees or self-employed - not businesses who get no extra relief on their employer National Insurance contributionsIncome tax main rate will beCUTfrom p to p - but not now, only in April  just before the next election That will affect  million people and be the first cut to the basic rate of income tax in  years But officials are unable to say where the money will come from. While the Chancellor could have more than £bn of aposheadroomapos this could quickly be wiped out by economic changes Fuel duty, transport and infrastructure Fuel duty will be cut by p a litre from pm tonight until March .Chancellor said itaposs the biggest cut ever Treasury boasted the fuel duty cut, along with a freeze already planned, will save the average van driver around £ this year - or £, for the average haulier But it will still only knock around £ off a -litre tank for a family carBenefits and pensionsNO change to the below-inflation .% rise in benefits and pensions next year NO extra help for energy bills despite claims he would increase the £ repayable loan in October Household Support Fund is doubled by £m - but this is just a backup fund for those in troubleWith UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year.Businesses and technology Employment Allowance for small firms will rise from £, to £, in April this year This is branded a aposnew tax cut worth up to £,apos for , small businesses The allowance allows firms to reduce their National Insurance employer contributions Government will reform RD tax credits and expand generosity to include data, cloud computing and pure maths Treasury will consider whether to make RD expenditure credit more generous Chancellor will cut tax rates on business investment in Autumn Budget - but details not yet confirmed or worked out Government aposwill considerapos changes to capital allowances aposahead of April apos Climate and aid For the next five years families installing solar , heat pumps, and insulation will pay % VAT instead of % Government will also reverse EU decision to take wind and water turbines out of scope and zero rate them too Treasury claims families will save £, in tax installing solar  - and that the decision is thanks to Brexit This measure can’t immediately apply to Northern Ireland, so the government is raising the issue with the EU Commission as a matter of urgency.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementRishi SunakPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The top Tory took calls from listeners at LBC on Wednesday after unveiling his Spring Statement, which did almost nothing to help Brits who will be clobbered by higher fuel bills when Ofgem raises the energy cap on April . The mum-of-two, who has three jobs, said she was a woman who on paper has a good job and whataposs considered a good salary but rising energy prices has now put an intense strain on my ability to provide for my children. Pleading with him to do more for families, she said: The signicant increase in our energy bills has meant that we donapost have the boiler on. The lights are always off unless absolutely necessary and when itaposs cold, we wear jumpers and coats and sometimes you can see our breaths when we breathe.  Now, despite working a full time job Iaposm having to find ways to bridge the gap. Iaposve started cleaning houses and I spend every evening riding a bike delivering Uber Eats. Iaposve managed to cut my grocery shop down to just £ a week for an adult and two children, and I often go without myself to make sure the kids get what they need and theyaposre fed. Before today, the Chancellor announced all energy customers will get a £ refund on their energy bill later in the year, which will be applied automatically from October.But it led to Mr Sunak being branded the loan shark Chancellor by Labour as the discount will be clawed back will need to be repaid in £ annual instalments, from April  over five years.Millions of Brits will also be eligible for a £ rebate off their council tax bill this year. The council tax rebate will apply to homes in council tax bands A, B, C or D in England and Wales - roughly % of properties - but not those who live in council tax bands E, F, G and H . Hzul told the Chancellor the governmentaposs £ off council tax and £ energy loan to cope with rising energy bills just isnapost going to cut it.  Iaposve just about been able to balance things up until this point, but Iaposm now facing paying out more each month that Iaposm making, Hzul said. What are you going to do to address the soaring cost of energy andyouaposre not doing anything, please me what  do you suggest I can be doing to help myself The Chancellor has been under mounting pressure to help Brits struggling with their energy bills as regulator Ofgem prepares to lt price cap by £ from April .It will mean a % jump most householdsapos bills - which go up from £, to £, - and prepayment customers will be worse off, with a bills hike of £ from £, to £,. Mr Sunak told Hzul: I canapost imagine how dficult your job is, adding he had enormous admiration for what youaposre doing, an it sounds like youaposre working your socks off to look after them, so tribute to you. He admitted there was no further help on offer apart from the council tax rebate and the energy loan, and we would have to seein October energy bills would be raised again.

The Chancellor offered no support for families facing energy bill hikes of £,, gave out measly benefits rises and snubbed hard-up pensioners. Even a p cut in fuel duty only brings soaring petrol prices back to what they were last week. It comes as experts warned households face the biggest single-year fall in incomes since . Labour’s Rachel Reeves said: “The ­Chancellor does not understand the scale of the challenge.”Hard-up Brits who pinned their hopes on Rishi Sunak easing the crippling cost-of-living crisis were dealt a crushing blow today.How will the spring statement affect you  Join the discussion in the comment section The Chancellor’s Spring Statement did little to help people struggling with soaring costs and energy bills.There was nothing to boost those on benefits or pensioners, who risk being plunged further into poverty. And even a p cut in fuel duty only takes the price of petrol back to last week’s after it had already gone up by the same amount.It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility warned families to prepare for the biggest single-year fall in household incomes since .Labour ’s Rachel Reeves said: “It’s clear the ­Chancellor does not understand the scale of the challenge.”  Mr Sunak’s overall package is targeted at the better off with those most likely to struggle faring worst. The ­Resolution ­Foundation think-tank claimed only £ in every £ announced in the ­mini-Budget would be going to the bottom half of the income ­distribution. It found the richest half of households gain £, compared to just £ for the poorest fth.People on benefits are getting a rise worth half the rate of inflation and have had Universal Credit cut by £, a year. And the Chancellor, with one eye firmly on the next election, pledged to cut income tax by p – but not until April .Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said: “The thing that was missing from this was anything for people on Universal Credit or state pension. That’s only going up by .% next month, when inflation may be %. So that’s going to be a big cut in living ­standards for those on the lowest incomes.”  Personal finance expert Martin Lewis warned the mini-Budget was “not going to lt that many out of the mire”.TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady added: “In the midst of the biggest wages and bills crisis in living memory, Rishi Sunak ’s ­statement has failed ­families.“We did not get the urgent help with soaring bills that they need.” Tax Justice UK executive director, Robert Palmer, said: “The Chancellor used his statement to campaign for an election in two years, while millions wonder what they’ll have to eat in two days.” Mr Sunak increased the threshold at which people pay National Insurance to £, from July, but refused to axe the planned rise from % to .%. And his failure to lt income tax ­thresholds as wages rise creates “fiscal drag” where more people are pulled into a higher tax bracket.

It means overall taxes are to hit .% of GDP – the highest burden since the late s. Official figures showed inflation would average .% this year – and could hit almost % later. The economy is f­orecast to grow by just .% this year, the OBR said – a sharp drop from its ­prediction of .%. Mr Sunak announced the ­household support fund will increase by £million for councils to distribute to those most in need. But two-thirds of Brits believe his measures will not benefit people like them much, according to a snap poll by YouGov.Asda and Sainsbury’s last night became the first retailer to pass on the cut in fuel duty, by dropping prices by p. But the RAC called the reduction in duty “something of a drop in the ocean”. Head of policy ­Nicholas Lyes said: “In reality, reducing it by p will only take prices back to where they were just over a week ago.” Key pointsFuel duty cut by p per litre with immediate effect Income tax cut by p from  People on benefits who get below-inflation rise and no extra help NI threshold increases - but so does levy itself Small boost for support via councils for poorest households No VAT on solar , heat pumps or insulation No extra money for defence Inflation could hit % this year Biggest single-year in household incomes since s. Benefits Charities have spoken of their shock that there is no extra cash for benefits. Payments are due to rise by just .% next month - despite inflation being .% and tipped to pass % later this year. Trussell Trust foodbank boss Emma Revie said: “The Chancellor has failed to create any security for people on the lowest incomes by failing to bring benefits payments in line with the true cost of living.” Child Poverty Action Group’s Sara Ogilvie said Rishi Sunak “should have increased benefits to match inflation”. She added: “He failed the children who needed him the most.” . Home Bills The Government has already announced a £ loan to every family to cut gas and electric payments from October although not until the price cap jumps %. In addition, some households get a £ council tax rebate in April. Homeowners installing solar , heat pumps, or insulation will not pay VAT. Local authorities will get another £m from April, to help vulnerable households. However, with energy bills set to reach almost £, a year from April, and again in October when the price cap rises, the extra support on offer is unlikely to go far enough. . Fuel Duty Motorists face an anxious wait to see how many petrol retailers pass on a p cut in fuel duty.The volatile oil market has sent prices soaring following Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, with a litre of petrol yesterday averaging £.. Until pm last night that included p of duty which has now been cut.Filling up an average family car should be £ cheaper. AA president Edmund King welcomed the move, but added: “The benefit will be lost unless retailers pass it on.” Road Haulage Association executive director Rod McKenzie said “more could have been done”. . Green issues VAT of % will be scrapped on installing solar , heat pumps and insulation to tackle high energy bills and cut emissions. It will knock £ off the £, cost of fixing solar  and comes as the energy price cap rises by £ next month. Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit analyst Jess Ralston called the VAT axe “a boost for families”.Doug Parr, of Greenpeace UK, said: “Millions pay to heat homes so poorly insulated the warmth shoots right outside. Cutting VAT on insulation, solar  and heat pumps is a welcome start to ending that huge waste of energy.” . National insuranceMr Sunak decided against postponing the planned National Insurance hike from % to .%, to fund the NHS backlog and social care, despite pressure from Tory and Opposition MPs.Instead, he is raising the threshold for when people start paying contributions by £, to £, from July – a tax cut for employees of about £ a year. Mr Sunak said around % of workers – everyone earning below £, according to the Resolution Foundation – would have their tax cut by more than April’s NI rise. But millions are still facing an increase overall. . IncomeIncome tax will fall by a penny weeks before the next general election. The basic rate is being cut to p in . The £bn giveaway is worth an average £.Tim Walford-Fitzgerald, of accountancy firm HW Fisher, said: “This is a tactical move from the Chancellor. Assuming it comes into effect from April , the first payslip you will see this in will arrive at the same time as election leaflets.” Maike Currie, of Fidelity International, said: “We know the personal allowance and higher rate band thresholds have been frozen for four years, meaning more people will be pulled into higher rates.” . Defence Pleas to pump more cash into the armed forces were rebuffed despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Mirror told last week how retired top brass, Tory MPs and military experts believe extra funds are needed. Rishi Sunak was challenged by the DUP’s Sammy Wilson who said: “Surprisingly there is no mention of additional resources for defence in the face of Putin’s aggression. Why ” Mr Sunak replied: “We increased the defence budget by £billion in , the largest increase since the Cold War. It was the only department that got a four-year settlement.” . Forecasts Economic growth will slow sharply this year and inflation will hit a -year high in the autumn. The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its growth outlook as it predicted inflation will average .% and peak at .%, the highest level since the late s and early s. The OBR thinks GDP will rise by .%, down from a % forecast. Real household disposable incomes will fall by .% in -, the lowest since records began.

Labour MP Dan Carden has urged the Government to recommit to helping victims of substance abuse Image: PAByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsA record number of Brits are dying from alcohol abuse because of a decade of Tory inaction, an MP has claimed. Labour ’s Dan Carden said lives could have been savedthe Conservatives had not axed plans for the minimum pricing of alcohol. Ten years ago today, David Cameron launched the Tories aposAlcohol Strategyapos which aimed to cut the number of heavy drinkers and ease the burden on the NHS.But plans for minimum unit pricing - raising the cost of the cheapest booze - were shelved. In , there were , alcohol-specic deaths across the UK. This up .% from  when there were , alcohol-specic deaths recorded across the UK. The rise was described as “statistically signicant” by the Office for National Statistics , which published the figuresNeeds a comparative figure. What was it in  or   Four out of five those alcohol-specic deaths in  – defined as being a direct consequence of alcohol misuse – were from liver disease. On top of this, the Alcohol Health Alliancefound only one in five dependent drinkers have had access to treatment. Mr Carden renewed calls for an Independent Review of Alcohol Harm and an Alcohol Strategy. He told the Mirror: “After a decade of inaction, this is not an anniversary worth celebrating. “With record alcohol-specic deaths, rising economic and social harms, and depleted treatment services, people are rightly asking why it has taken so long for the Government to bring forward a plan to tackle alcohol harm. “We need to remove barriers to effective action, including the undue influence of corporate lobbyists on policy decisions. Government must finally put public health first. Lives depend on it.”  Sir Ian Gilmore, Chair of the AHA added: “The situation has never looked bleaker. “Deaths from alcohol are now at record highs, only one in five dependent drinkers are in treatment and alcohol causes  cancer cases every day. Meanwhile, the Alcohol Industry lines its pockets. “We need a strategy with measures to stop the incessant promotion of alcohol, give consumers information on harms, and to properly fund alcohol treatment.” Boris Johnson included plans to tackle alcohol-related crime in his -year drug strategy.In his -year drugs plan, Mr Johnson vowed to deliver world-class drug and alcohol treatment and a recovery system across England. By the end of   the Government promises to deliver at least , new high-quality drug and alcohol treatment places, a % increase on current numbers.

Taking more money out of peopleaposs pay packets and bank accounts when prices are rocketing is the Tory Treasury pouring petrol on the cost of living crisis. This Chancellor remains a record tax raiser, upping the National Insurance threshold giving back only a little of the extra £-billion to be grabbed. Reducing fuel duty p might never be felt at the pumps and is a fraction of an increase in the price of a litre since topping p since the start of the year.And that promise of a p Income Tax cut in two years is an election bribe suggesting a contest in Autumn  or Spring . It deserves to be greeted with the same suspicion generated by PO claims the ferry firm obeys the law.

Butlers with Bums and the Adonis Cabaret say there is a national shortage of naked men so are now searching for guys- between the ages of  and  - who like to work out and show off their muscles.Former butler Dan Harley - who runs Butlers with Bums - says demand is surging again after the pandemic.He added that thereaposs a lack of men willing to get their kit off for hen party celebrations which is becoming a real problem for business, Plymouth Live reports.Dan said: “We have a lot of demand for our buff butlers across the UK right now for hen dos, birthday parties and corporate events, but because of the pandemic, there is a national shortage of guys, and it is becoming a big problem for us. Those lucky enough to get the position will be required to wear Butlers with Bums’ signature black and pink attire including an apron where you’ll be showing your bum at the back. You’ll also don a collar, cuffs and a bow tie. An earlier report by the Liverpool Echo revealed how nude butlers can earn from £ to £ per hour, plus generous tips.So,you’re up for a laugh and a flash of the derriere then this could be just the job for you. The company is also on the look out for models for le drawing classes, with men notoriously less inclined to volunteer for the role. Former actor and performer Tristan Mills, who runs the Adonis Cabaret, said: “We are hoping to expand our shows and recruit many more guys. We know there are gym enthusiasts and fitness lovers out there that are perfect for the job and would like them to urgently get in touch and get involved.” So what will the butler position involve  As the buff butler that you are, you’ll be engaging in all sorts of playful party antics, from serving up canapes and tipples, to posing with hens for photos.If this sounds like your sort of thing, you can find out more information by heading over to Butlerswithbums and Adoniscabaret. One butler working in Liverpool previously revealed what its like on-the-job as a nude servant. The man, who chose to remain anonymous, said: “The main thing people may get wrong about the job is that we are strippers or adult performers “Everything important is covered up and the rest is left to the imagination. We are there to help host the party and look after the guests while providing some hot eye candy for the girls and a bit of cheeky banter.” When asked about the most hysterical thing he has ever seen, the butler said: “Once I was at party and the group were playing ‘I have never…’ I was reading out the questions and the girls were standing up and drinking a sip for things they had done. “The funniest thing was revealed when I read out the question ‘I have never had a threesome’ the only one who stood up and drank was the mother of the bride!

Marion Reith, a pharmacy worker from Edinburgh, was just at home when she suddenly heard a loud bang - only to find out her puppy Leia had chewed on an inhaler. The pharmacy worker knew the potentially lethal dangers of salbutamol which is inside an inhaler and so she rushed Leia to the Vets Now clinic in the Scottish capital, reports the Daily Record.She said: “Leia can be quite playful and she has a thing for chewing anything plastic she can get hold of. “Because of that, I’m really careful to keep my inhaler well away from Leia. It was in my handbag and I’d been looking for something and must have left it on the floor. “I’d just stepped into the kitchen when I heard this bang, and I knew right away what must have happened.“It had exploded so fiercely we had to hunt for the cylinder which had shot right across the room. “Leia was just standing there looking dazed. I work in a pharmacy and had done some training last year and had learned that the inhalers were toxic to pets.  “I knew it could shut down her organs and prove fatal, so I needed help quickly. Her heart rate was racing, and it was so worrying.” Veterinary staff admitted Leia for treatment following a thorough examination. Tests discovered Leia was suffering from cardiotoxicity and Mario faced an anxious overnight wait on the condition of her pup.  Fiona Selby, emergency vet surgeon at Vets Now Edinburgh, said: “There was evidence of cardiotoxicity and we wanted to get her heart rate down safely. “We put her on fluid and medication and, happily, over the next few hours the heart rate slowed, her potassium levels stabilised and Leia started to recover. “Inhalers can be highly dangerous and getting Leia here really quickly was vital.” Thankfully, Marion was able to pick Leia up the following morning. She is now on the mend following the traumatic episode. “She was a bit off-colour for a couple of days, but she was back to her old self after that”, Marion added. “It just shows that it only takes a moment, so do keep inhalers well away from pets and don’t delaysomething happens.

They now want to move to Spain for a warmer climate to help their four-year-old sonaposs brittle bones. The whole house is freshly decorated, with a large back garden, garage and driveway big enough for two cars. The master bedroom has its own en-suite. The winnings also include Claire and Benaposs seven-seater Range Rover Sport and Kawasaki Ninja Superbike.The couple has four children, aged , , four, and four months. Claire said: Weaposve sorted all the estate agent and legal fees and things like that so all anybody has to do is buy a ticket. We won the house in a similar raffle two years ago and have been living in it since. But my second youngest, who is four, has a health condition. He has brittle bones, so we want to move to Spain as the warmer climate will be so much better for him.  It will mean so much to us to be able to do that for him - this could make our dreams come true of starting a new le. The raffle is managed by the competitionaposs  Raffall, which ensures ticket revenue remains blocked until winners confirm receipt of their prizes.

In many areas of the country home delivery of free NHS lateral flow tests are unavailable.People trying to order are discouraged to order packs when they try and access them online. “Most tests are now needed for people at higher risk,” according to the online ordering system.“In England, most people without Covid- symptoms no longer need to take rapid lateral flow tests. “Some people still need tests to stay safe, like: NHS staff people who are at higher risk people who are visiting high-risk places.“We want to make sure tests are available for people who need them most.”  There is still confusion within the NHS as to whether tests will still be free for staff. The NHS Confederation said that workers may be forced to fork out about £ a month for teststhey have to pay themselves, as it called for clarity over the issue. The Department of Health and Social Care said that more details would be set out “shortly”. Free universal testing for the virus will come to an end on April , with free tests only being made available to the most vulnerable. Officials have previously said that the number of free tests available each day will be capped to “manage demand” as the Government scales back free testing for people in England.  The public have been encouraged not to stockpile test packs but since ministers announced the end of the free testing programme for most of the population it has been dficult for many to access them. But the UK Health Security Agencysaid that availability is refreshed regularly. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “As set out in the Living With Covid plan, from April  free tests will only be available for certain groups who are at most risk from the virus.“In preparation for this change, the gov.uk home ordering channel is asking users to only order test kitsyou’re eligible for new Covid- treatments, work or volunteer in a high-risk setting or support people who are at higher risk from Covid-.“Tests should only be ordered after you have used up any kits you already have at home.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chaz Carl Powell had been visiting his girlfriend in Montego Bay, Jamaica but was due toas he was suffering with sickle cell anaemia. The -year-old had put on weight and grown dreads since his passport photo was taken. His passport was also slightly damaged, but his driving licence was in perfect condition. Chaz, from Camberwell, was due to have his six weekly blood transfusion as soon as he got home, but the missed flight meant he had to apply for emergency travel documents at the British Consulate instead.On March , he died of apparent organ failure after his health spiralled out of control, MyLondon reports. A British Airways said the company was saddened to hear about Chazaposs death, adding airport staff did what they could to help but the passport was too badly damaged to be considered as a valid travel document.  Chazaposs mum, Sandra Powell, , claims her son should have been let on the flight home. Sandra, a Southwark Council officer, said: I canapost talk about it, I do not even want to think about it. To know that he actually went on holiday and itaposs something he would do on a regular basis. That should never have happened, they had no right to take control of my sonaposs le. Sandra admitted she was in complete shock over her sonaposs death. The devastated mum added Chaz would drive her around whenever she needed him, so much so people thought he was my partner. Chaz was also close to his grandma and the pair always went to their hospital appointments together.  Sandra added: My mum has dementia, but when she sees all the flowers she keeps breaking down. I have to hide some of the cards so she will not read them. Sandra claims her sonaposs death was brought on by the stress of having his passport rejected. He had an arrangement for his nurse at Kings, as soon as he landed he would ring her for an appointment and come in to get his transfusion, she added. Chazaposs girlfriend Monique Allen, , reported that Chaz was complaining of stomach aches and finding it dficult to eat while he waited for new documents. He collapsed while at Spanish Town Hospital and doctors were unable to resuscitate him.  Chaz was on regular painkillers and treatment, but the photo he took for his new travel documents showed he was suffering severe jaundice just before he died. Cold, exercise, dehydration, and stress are all known to worsen symptoms of sickle cell. A British Airways spokesperson said: Weaposre saddened to hear that one of our customers has passed away and our thoughts are with his friends and family at this dficult time. Airlines are required by law to ensure that all documents presented for travel are valid. While our airport team did what they could to help Mr Powell, unfortunately the photo page of his passport was so badly damaged it could no longer be regarded as a valid travel document.

The franchise said it is working hard to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. A spokesperson said: “We are currently experiencing a shortage in our supply of tomatoes. As a result, the Big Tasty and the Big Tasty with Bacon are being served with one slice of tomato rather than two. We apologise for any inconvenience, and thank our customers for their patience.  The Big Tasty consists of a large, thick patty topped with Emmental cheese tomato, lettuce, slivered onions and bacon as an option. Itaposs been a huge hit among fast food fans but is only available for a limited amount of time each year - often just a few weeks at a time. It has previously left so many customers wondering why it isnapost always on the menu that last year McDonaldaposs actually put up an explanation on its website.  A statement said: Unfortunately, though itaposs a customer favourite, weaposre unable to offer the Big Tasty all year round because of the limited capacity in our kitchens. If we offered it all year, we wouldnapost have the space to grill the other promotional burgers which are also super popular. But always keep your eyes peeled, Big Tasty fans.  And the tomato shortage is not the first time McDonaldaposs food has been impacted by supply issues.In August last year no milkshakes or bottled drinks were available in any of its outlets across England, Scotland and Wales for a brief period.A shortage of lorry drivers due to new EU immigration rules and Covid restrictions at the time was understood to be behind the supply problem. A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: Like most retailers, we are currently experiencing some supply chain issues, impacting the availability of a small number of products. Bottled drinks and milkshakes are temporarily unavailable in restaurants across England, Scotland and Wales. We apologise for any inconvenience, and thank our customers for their continued patience.

The Duchess also told the assembled students: “You, as teachers are at the front line of this work and play a crucial role in shaping our societies by positively impacting the futures of literally thousands of young people over the course of your careers.” The couple signed a visitoraposs book before walking to an infant school on site. Children waved England flags as they walked by and the Duchess paused to give high fives to some. Inside a classroom, William met Natalia Young, who was celebrating her fourth birthday and wore a rosette and plastic crown. The Duke asked how old she was, what kind of party she would have and how many candles. Elsewhere, the Duchess asked a group their names and ages. She asked one girl: “Who did your hair today ” She also asked them their favourite colours, telling the children hers was green “because it’s the colour of nature” and that William’s was blue, “like the sea and the rivers.” The Duchess later described the children as being “so sweet.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince GeorgePrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Thursday more C heat means that the UK will be warmer than the Spanish holiday island of Lanzarote. Like Wednesday the day will start cold before the sunshine arrives.  “This settled spell of spring sunshine carries on for the rest of the week and beyond, Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said. “With clear skies expected tonight temperatures will fall away and a few mist and fog patches could form in one or two spots. They will be fairly isolated and most likely in parts of eastern England for example like recent nights with temperatures dipping away as well. A touch of frost in places as we start off Thursday. Frost free Western Isles, parts of Northern Ireland where it will turn cloudier through the night, perhaps one or two showers into the Western Isles.” Air from the Atlantic is bringing cloudier skies for the north west of Scotland and spots of rain but the high pressure is dominant over the UK meaning warm weather for most.  Mr McGivern continued: On the whole after a chilly start. Much of the UK still basking in that warm March sunshine and temperatures similar across England and Wales to recent days C to C, could squeeze a C in Cambridgeshire for example. Then for Friday there is more of the same eventemperatures are fractionally lower. “Plenty more, well, fine weather to come ... blue skies across the board virtually just one exception there for Shetland, Orkney, thicker clouds, a few drizzly showers at time but where largely dry, said Mr McGivern. For the vast majority dry once againand those temperatures are responding. Technically down a degree or so compared to the last couple of days but with light winds and sunshine I doubt it will be that noticeable. And really those temperatures in place are C perhaps C above average so very warm for the time of year. UK forecast for the next  days Rather cloudy in the northwest, where mostly dry and sunny Today: Early fog patches quickly clearing to leave another warm day with plenty of sunshine for most. Very isolated afternoon showers may develop in the north, more likely over eastern Scotland. Cloudier in the northwest with some light rain at times. Tonight: Rather cloudy for parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, especially the far north and northwest where a little light rain. Clear where with patchy frost and a few fog patches. Friday: Again dry and warm with sunny spells for many although cloudier in the far northwest. One or two isolated afternoon showers may develop across northern England and southeastern Northern Ireland. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Mainly settled with light winds and warm sunny spells cloudier in the far north with occasional light rain. Early mist fog patches in places, clearning inland but lingering near some coasts.

Our people carrier took £ of diesel at the weekend, and that wasn’t even full. “Mark used to have a van and a car and we’ve already downsized to a nine-seater people carrier to combine the two, and then fuel increases like this.  “We used to spend £ a month on Asda on all our monthly essentials with an £ per week top-up shop inbetween, so we decided to shop at Aldi to cut costs. “At first this cut our bills in half, which we were pleased at, but we can’t buy everything there so we have to do another top up.” Now they spend £ a month on groceries, one hundred pounds more than before.  “It seems we’re doing our best to cut corners, but costs are rising to negate these cuts. It’s very worrying,” she explained. “I had my children young, I was  when I had Joshua, but our plan had always been for me to stay at home with the kids until they were all at school and then pursue a career, but I’ve already had to take on work.” And she says the future gas and electric bills “scare” her.“We rent our property and we’ve just signed a contract to live here for two more years so we have to make sure we are able to pay that. “I’ve started to feel massively guilty around spending.

The -year-old, from Tampa, Florida, was admitted to Tampa General hospital in January this year and her condition started to deteriorate rapidly over a two week period due to organ failure.Claire, who was born with a congenital heart condition, was also diagnosed with myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, mild pneumonia, cyanosis and acidosis, Yahoo News reports.She was given a TandemHeart – which helps to send a steady supply of oxygenated blood to organs – and hours after that was placed on continuous dialysis because of her failing kidneys. As the complications worsened, so did the condition in her leg so doctors performed a fasciotomy to relieve the swelling and pressure. Despite trying to save her legs, the damage was too severe and irreversible, her dad Wayne Bridges revealed. In February Ms Bridges, who is vaccinated, had both legs cut off above the knee. She wasnapost getting circulation to her legs and, because of that, there was a lot of muscle damage, her best friend Heather Valdes told WTVT, Newsweek reported. Doctors also discovered she was bleeding internally resulting in an emergency blood transfusion.They found a very rare lesion in the first part of the small intestines that had ruptured, her dad revealed on Facebook. Luckily they were able to fix it and stop the bleeding. Despite the le-changing event, Ms Bridges remained positive according to family and friends who described her as an amazing young woman and a warrior. Her dad Wayne has detailed his daughteraposs journey on Facebook and revealed on March  that she was finally able to sit up herself for the first time since January. Two months to the day this all started and Claire, for the first time sat up by herself, he wrote on Facebook. It may not seem like a lot, but for this Warrior itaposs a major victory! And for this victory, it looks like our Warrior girl is coming home to her momaposs house today for the rehab phase of her journey. This week, Claire was released from hospital in time for her st birthday. She is very happy to be home around family and friends, Mr Bridges told Newsweek. Itaposs been mentally, emotionally taxing but weaposre hopeful now. She is still facing more challenges but we are focused on having her home. Mr Bridges said his daughter will require ongoing rehab with physical and occupational therapy. She will also need to prepare for prosthetic legs. Mr Bridges set up a GoFundMe page for his daughter with hopes to raise £, which will go towards Claireaposs medical and ongoing recovery expenses. I am so proud of you and inspired by you. You have overcome more in two months than any of us could imagine in a letime, Mr Bridges wrote in a touching tribute on Facebook. You will be climbing again before you know it.

OBrien has now been sentenced to a juvenile facilityTravis O’Brien, now , has been sentenced to a juvenile facilityByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Mar A -year-old boy and a -year-old pal armed with an AK- held a  minute shoot-out with police in Florida. Travis O’Brien, now , has been sentenced to a juvenile facility after firing at police in June last year along with his teen accomplice Nicole Jackson. The pair had broken out of a local children’s home and had entered a house in Volusia County when the gun fight started.Defence lawyer Jeff Deen told WESH-TV : “He’s a little tiny, little boy and he got into a big mess.“He wasn’t in control of his situation and he can’t understand some of the things that we understand.” The youngster pleaded no contest to charges of burglary, criminal mischief and attempted murder of law enforcement officers, and was remanded to a maximum-risk assessment programme followed by a conditional release.  The “Bonnie and Clyde” duo had escaped from Florida United Methodist Children’s Home and were hiding in an empty home in nearby Enterprise on June . Police arrived after reports of a break-in at the property and began to be fired at by the two children. The gun battle continued for  minutes with an officer heard saying on a viral video at one point that Jackson was “re-racking”. The officer said: “Female has a shotgun in her hand, stand by.” He is then heard shouting “put the gun down now” and then shooting can be heard.  “They’re shooting on me,” the officer then said. “Hold the air. I’m code . She’s re-racking a round inside the shotgun.” The dispatcher replies: “Let’s not engage them anymore. “Let’s not challenge them.” But the officer said: “She’s racked a round in the shotgun. The window’s busted on the patio side. If she comes out she’s going to have the shotgun.” Then moments later Jackson came out of the house with gun and was shot - with her screams heard in video footage. “I think the female’s down,” an officer said. “Call in the units. Female’s on the ground behind the car.”  The footage then shows the boy surrendering and being taken into custody. Jackson was taken to hospital with le threatening injuries after being shot in the chest and arm but she recovered after surgery. She is yet to be sentenced for her involvement in the incident. Meanwhile, a couple, Shauna and Dan Willis, have reportedly offered to adopt Jackson after talking to her by phone from her jail.“We just have good intentions in mind for her. So, we pray for her every day, andwe can give her a family, we’d be willing to do that,” Shauna Willis told WNDU.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PoliceCrimeBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Two properties that were once at the centre of the disgraced financieraposs real estate portfolio are being listed for £ million. Situated in the US Virgin Islands, Great St James and Little St James islands have been put on the market by Epsteinaposs estate. According to reports in the US, money from their sale will help fund outstanding lawsuits filed by the late sex offenderaposs victims and the costs of running the properties. Little St James is where the Duke of Yorkaposs sex accuser Virginia Giuffre claimed in court he took part in a nine girl orgy with Epstein. The Prince vehemently denied her claims.  Ms Giuffre wrote in evidence to a Florida Court on January , : The third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands. I was around  at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together. The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of  and didn’t really speak English. Ms Giuffre added Epstein “laughed about the fact they couldn’t really communicate, saying that they are the ‘easiest’ girls to get along with”. The court filings were made in a civil defamation lawsuit filed by Ms Giuffre against since-convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The mum-of-three would later go on to sue Andrew in August  for sex abuse in New York. The case was settled last month with a reported £ million out of court settlement paid to Ms Giuffre by the royal. Before his jail cell suicide in August , Epstein once described the United States Virgin Islands as my favourite place to be. It became a haven for him and his associates, Epsteinaposs victims claim to have been abused there. The financieraposs private aposLolita Expressapos jet would fly him to St Thomasaposs international airport, where he would board a helicopter that flew him to his Little St. James and Great St. James islands. Once there, he was known to entertain famous friends and, his accusers have claimed in court filings, trafficked underage girls for sex. Epstein arrived in the Virgin Islands in , when he paid £ million for Little St. James, a roughly -acre island. He called it Little St Jeffaposs. In , he bought the larger Great St. James for £. million.  Over the years, he spent millions more developing the islands, including building a villa with a library, a Japanese bathhouse and a movie theatre. When he was there, he cultivated close ties to the islandsapos political and financial elite. He once employed a governoraposs we. Epstein hired an architecture firm owned by the same governoraposs uncle. He also donated money, sponsored scholarships and even gave dozens of computers to give away. A lawsuit filed by prosecutors in the US Virgin Islands two years ago alleged Epstein used his two secluded islands to engage in a nearly two-decade conspiracy to traffic and abuse girls as young as  years old.  According to the complaint, he and others organised a search party to catch a -year-old victim trying to swim away and kept her passport to keep her captive. From  to , Epstein and his aides, among them Ghislaine Maxwell, flew girls from other countries to the Virgin Islands on the multimillionaireaposs private plane. Epstein, , killed himself in a New York federal jail in August  while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell, , was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other charges for helping Epstein sexually abuse multiple teenage girls from  to .

The home video footage shows the two heartless dog owners allow their pets to freely attack the cat, named Buddy, who was sitting on the porch. The men can be heard shouting get him and good boy while the dogs attack the cat. Moments beforehand, the two men could be seen on camera with their dogs walking past the home, before stopping after noticing the cat. The horric attack lasts  seconds before a homeowner comes out to try and save the cat.  Someone can be heard shouting no, while Buddy is clearly in discomfort. Pennsylvania SPCA are investigating the attack, which happened in Frankford, Philadelphia on Tuesday morning. The Pennsylvania SPCA is asking for the public’s help identying two iniduals who appear to be responsible for an intentional dog attack on a family’s cat in the city’s Frankford neighbourhood this morning, Pennsylvania SPCA said in a statement.  The video shows two iniduals walking two dogs passed a family home on Granite Street. On the video it appears that an inidual spots the cat named Buddy on a porch, comes back and releases one dog on the cat followed by a second dog. As the attack continued, a person or persons can be heard on the video encouraging the dogs to continue attacking the cat until a resident of the property comes out to intervene on behalf of the cat. Buddy sustained le-threatening injuries and was transported to the PSPCA.  In an update posted on Wednesday, Pennsylvania SPCA said Buddy had been sent to an ER vet to be closely monitored. He made it through the night. He continues to be in extremely critical condition. We arecautiously optimistic, the update said. Pennsylvania SPCA have now released pictures of two men they wish to identy in connection with the attack. Anyone with information is urged to contact the PSPCAaposs cruelty hotline -- or cruelty@pspca.org. Tips can be left anonymously.

While the UK has imposed strict measures on the oligarch to isolate Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden has resisted pressure to target him specically.Following a call from Zelensky, the White House has reportedly persuaded the US Treasury Department not to go ahead with plans to target Abramovich and his businesses.The development explains why one of the worldaposs richest men has avoided US sanctions despite the UK and European Union hitting him with travel bans and asset freezes.According to reports, Biden consulted Zelensky on a range of sanctions, including plans for the Cha boss.  When approached about the call, Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said: We are not going to read out private conversations between President Biden and President Zelensky. The Treasury Department have yet to respond to a request for comment. For the negotiations, and in the interest of them succeeding, it is not helpful commenting on the process nor Abramovichaposs involvement, a spokesperson for Abramovich, , said.  As previously stated, based on requests, including from Jewish organisations in Ukraine, he has been doing all he can to support efforts aimed at restoring peace as soon as possible.The Russian billionaire, who is believed to now be in Moscow, made his fortune buying up discounted state assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  But due to his close relationship with Putin, he has been subject to a string of sanctions in the UK and Europe. Abramovich has put Cha Football Club up for sale with an asking price of at least £billion. He is also writing off the £.billion debt the club owes him. His UK staff are said to have been preparing for viewings of his £ million mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, London, and a three-storey penthouse at Cha Waterfront.

Mona Route, , was let go from her server job at an airport in Melbourne, Australia, when Covid- hit in March , and the newfound time on her hands left her feeling so bored, the Daily Star reports. With nothing  to do, Mona decided to take up baking as a hobby to pass the time and soon found herself trying out experimental dessert recipes - which eventually led her to start her own cookie business.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The former waitress told news.au : “I was so bored. That’s when I started baking.”Monaaposs loaded cookie recipes became her cheat meal when she was on her mission to lose weight, and the massive snacks are made up of baked cookie dough that surrounds a sweet filling such as Malteser spread or melted Kinder Bueno that oozes out when you bite the cookie.The cookies quickly became a hit with her family and friends, and when her dad suggested she start selling the sweet treats, the woman set up Monaaposs Treats with  unique cookie flavours to choose from.The keen baker created an Instagram account and spent on ingredients for her first industrial-sized batch.At first, Mona was selling around  to  cookies a month, but she now has a monthly average of a staggering  orders - leaving her waking up at  am to keep up with demand. During the height of lockdown, Mona was selling as many as  cookies a month but has since slowed production down so that she can work her new frontline job while keeping up Monaaposs Treats as a side hustle on her days off.

Even the bedrooms remain set up to welcome guests, with towels laid out neatly on the beds. One of the bedrooms contained an impressive four-poster bed, perfect for newlyweds. Daniel, who films inside buildings across the UK that are no longer in use, described experiencing an eerie feeling while inside the hotel asthey were being watched.

Daniel first learned about Northop Hall Country House Hotel in Wales after reading an article about its closure and decided to head up to have a look for himself back in January.The hotel first opened its doors back in , and many weddings were held there up until the coronavirus pandemic struck in March .Many engaged couples had paid deposits to hold their wedding receptions at Northop Hall Country House Hotel, but sadly, the hotel never reopened and remains silent and abandoned to this day. Daniel said: “There was so much left behind and the strangest part was the weddingrooms themselves which appeared like they had been set up for weddings that never happened. In a video filmed for his YouTube channel BeardedReality, Daniel shows how the entrance hall still has a glittering chandelier in place, while a grand piano has been left behind in a side room to the left of the front door. He continued: The windows by the fire escape were left open so this was our entrance inside, however after looking around the place we realized the front door was just wide open. Pretty much everywhere had open access for us to check out.“The atmosphere was very strange. Once you get over the fact that this place is just wide open and left like this with the lights turned on and everything working, itaposs hard to believe that the place has been left at all. “As we were going around the property, we got an eerie feeling like we were being watched which put us on our toes.The group spent two hours in total capturing videos and photos of the hotelaposs interior, with fans of Danielaposs YouTube channel left fascinated by their findings.

Darren spoke to Delish about what each type of coffee means for the person who drinks it - so what does your favourite say about you Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Black coffee A black coffee, or Americano, is one of the easiest things to order at any coffee house, as youaposll be able to skip the questions about which type of milk youaposd prefer. And according to Darren,you like the no-nonsense approach of a black coffee, then youaposre probably someone who is determined, focused, and driven. But the expert says the ambition of a black coffee drinker can also drive them to be self-sufficient and empowered - meaning they can border on having a selfish mentality. Latte Although coffee gives us a caffeine hit, donapost expect latte drinkers to be hyperactive - as theyaposre actually the most laidback of all coffee drinkers, according to Darren.  The behavioural expert claims a latte lover is likely to be a middle-of-the-road type that doesnapost like taking risks. He added: Latte drinkers tend to be mild-mannered, agreeable, happy to go with the flow. They just want something simple to drink without complication. Cappuccino Frothier than a latte, the cappuccino is a more adventurous drink - and it makes those who drink it more fun, too. Darren says these coffee fans arenapost afraid of unknown territory, and are therefore open-minded and always up for trying something new. Espresso Much like their black coffee drinking friends, anyone who walks into a coffee shop and dares to order a single or double shot of espresso is likely a no-nonsense, straight-talking type of person, according to Darren.  The expert says ordering an espresso illustrates someone is adventurous and powerful and strong in character - and theyaposre probably also the type of person to order a shot of whiskey or rum in a pub. Mocha Blending the sophistication of coffee with the sweetness of chocolate, the mocha is probably the cutest of all coffees. Darren believes anyone who enjoys a mocha is very extroverted, outgoing, flamboyant, and potentially quite loud - and friends probably call them the le of the party. Flat white If mochas indicate carefree people, then flat white drinkers are the complete opposite - as Darren says this drink is most commonly enjoyed by coffee snobs who like the acquired taste of the strong drink. He said: The flat white is a much stronger coffee and a more acquired taste. People who order flat whites could perhaps be loners. Theyaposd stand by their opinions no matter what and have clear views on particularly spiky subjects. The expert also has similar opinions about cortado drinkers, who are intelligent but also enjoy sticking to the rules and havin structure in their lives. Syrups For those of us who like an extra taste of something sweet in our coffee, Darren says youaposre most likely to be trustworthy and creative - as you like to switch things up with your coffee order. The expert believes those who put syrup in coffee are happy to experiment with new flavours.

The well-preserved graves, dating to the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period, were unearthed in Saqqara, an acropolis outside Cairo, last week. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has since confirmed that the tombs belonged to some of the era’s top officials, including court advisers and priests. Pictures taken by photographers show the inside of the tombs, which boast elaborately painted walls. Itaposs reported the chambers contained over  sarcophagi, toys, wooden boats, masks and more artefacts.Mostafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, spoke outside one of the tombs, as seen on the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities Facebook page.  He said: From one oaposclock in the morning, we are proud that this discovery was made by pure Egyptian hands. We are talking about a grave of someone called Hino. Talking about an old country. Weaposre talking about , years, patterns and colours at its finest.  Today they gonna tease the whole world. And they say this discovery was done by pure Egyptian hands. Although there are very many mission that went to Saqqara area, but it was a great sadness and praise to God that we discover five graves that we announce today to amaze the world and the work did not stop. Wait for more, god willing.The news comes after last week it was revealed hidden voids in the Great Pyramid of Giza could be the secret chambers of a pharaohaposs tomb. A high-powered scan revealed there are two hidden voids inside the largest man-made pyramid on Earth and now archaeologists are planning to get a better look inside with better technology.The largest of the two voids is  feet long and  feet wide. Archaeologists are hoping new scans will uncover what the mysterious voids were used for.Researchers believe the best case scenario would be the uncovering of the hidden burial chamber of pharaoh Khufu, who reigned over Egypt from  BC to  BC, and was the man the pyramid was built for.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pyramids\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duchess of Cambridge was given a ceremonial welcome yesterday at Kingstonaposs Norman Manley International Airport and eagle-eyed royal fans say claim they saw Kate get shunned by Lisa Hanna, a former Miss World turned politician with the Peopleaposs National Party. Ms Hannaaposs party, led by Mark Golding, is in favour of removing the Queen as head of state as well as lobbying Britain for reparations. The Duchess, , and Ms Hanna chatted during the ceremony, but fans online say they saw a moment that appeared to be frosty where the royal looked like she was trying to speak to the politician only for her to turn away.  Ms Hanna did not smile as Kate quickly dropped her smile and faced forward, they said as a video of the alleged encounter went viral.The clip of this moment was shared widely on Twitter as many said they had second-hand embarrassment.Another tweeted: Yikes!!! The embarrassment! A third added: Oh damn I just felt a huge second-hand embarrassment.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

It could be that Ms Hanna didnapost hear Kate speak to her at that moment.Ms Hanna, who met Prince Harry on his visit to Jamaica in , shared on Instagram they had a pleasant conversation.She wrote: Today I welcomed Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate to Jamaica on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition in celebration of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. We had a very interactive and pleasant conversation throughout the proceedings as we talked about family, our cultures and our people. There’s no doubt at this time that we all seek our true independence and want to develop systems  strategies where we become free from the monarchy. But until then we will always remain a courteous and respectful country. I am a firm believer in reparations and as such when I was Minister of Youth and Culture I led the reparations committee which made strides in developing submissions to Britain which examined the economic cost of slavery to our country.  I welcome them wholeheartedly with our warm hospitality, and look forward to us having productive discussions about our future. Prince William and Kate arrived in Jamaica last night as campaigners and leading politicians on the Caribbean island said their visit was “ill-timed and ill-conceived”. The island nation is odds on to be the next British realm to dump the Queen as head of state, following on from Barbados which last year officially became a republic. Prince Charles formally acknowledged the appalling atrocity of slavery in the Caribbean, saying it forever stains our history at the ceremony in Barbados to mark the country’s new beginning.Around  protesters gathered outside the British High Commission in Jamaica yesterday calling for slavery reparations.

Omid tweeted: I do wonder what the hell palace organisers were thinking with some of yesterdayaposs photo moments.  The planning and recon that goes into every step of these engagements is next level, so how did no one think to avoid certain imagery apos This is why ersity on a team matters. But royal experts quickly commented that separate photos showed England footballer Raheem Sterling, who was born on the island, posing for similar shots with the fans after appearing on the pitch with the royals yesterday.  Wider shots also showed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge smiling, laughing and shaking hands with their supporters through the fence after the match. Royal editor and host of the Pod Save The Queen podcast Russell Myers posted: For all the commentary from tightly cropped pictures of William and Kate saying hello and shaking hands to people standing behind a metal fence, which was actually on a football field after a game, here is Raheem Sterling in the same place doing the same thing yesterday.apos He added: I donapost know where to start with this…. Incredibly disappointing manipulation and absolute distortion of facts, supplemented by a completely perverse take which I still canapost get my head around.  Omidaposs comments come as the Cambridgeaposs posed for smiling selfies and were met with chants of we love you, we love you on their first day in Jamaica, on a tour to mark the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee. The royals also met the Jamaican bobsleigh team, who finished th in the recent Winter Olympics, on their week-long tour that will next see them in the Bahamas.  But it comes as the Cambridgeaposs, on arrival in Jamaica were met by a much-publicised demonstration urging the monarchy to pay reparations for slavery, and there have been calls from politicians for the country to drop the Queen as head of state and become a republic. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s visit to Jamaica has given the nation the opportunity address “unresolved” issues, Prime Minister Andrew Holness has told the couple.  As he welcomed the couple before sitting down for talks, Mr Holness said: “There are issues here which are, as you would know, unresolved but your presence gives an opportunity for those issues to be placed in context, put front and centre and to be addressed in as bestas we can. “But Jamaica is, as you would see, a country that is very proud of our history, very proud of what we have achieved. “And we’re moving on and we intend to attain in short order our development goals and fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country.” Buckingham Palace declined to comment on Omid Scobieaposs claims.

Major Dmitry Toptun, a motorised battalion leader, reportedly died when his armoured vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile in Izyum, near Kharkiv. While paratrooper commander Major Alexey Osokin is also understood to have died in the fighting where.There are said to be multiple reasons for why so many of the Presidentaposs senior commanders have been wiped out since the special operation started this time last month.Ukrainian figures suggest up to , invading troopers have been killed - with Moscow still having failed to take the capital Kyiv. Toptun and Osokinaposs apparent deaths come after three Spetsnaz special forces commandos were liquidated during the battle for Mariupol.Documents found in a captured Tigr tank implied Captain Konstantin Druzhkov, , Islam Abduragimov,  and Shamil Aselderov, age unknown, were all among those killed. Leaked intelligence showed Putin had been hopeful of completing his invasion within  hours, after troops moved across the border in the early hours of February  - followed by a relentless campaign of air strikes. The Kremlinaposs inner circle is blaming such leaks to Britain and the US - subsequently passed to Ukraine - for their poor progress and has launched a purge to find those guilty of undercutting them.  Putin is said to be incandescent and believes such betrayal has, at least in part, allowed the movements of his top generals and elite forces to be so easily tracked. The President - a former Soviet KGB intelligence officer prior to his rise to power - is also reported to be growing wary of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who is in overall charge of the invasion. Sources are also reported to have said Putin has been dismissive in private of long-time ally Alexander Bortnikov, FSB security service head.  Putin has also reportedly started snapping in meetings at Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff - blaming him for heavy losses of military hardware. The Russian leaderaposs fury has also been allegedly targeted at Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed forces. Before the invasion even began he humiliated SVR foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin during a public meeting.  There is some suggestion Putin will negotiate a deal which heaposll market to the Russian people as a surrender, before launching a victory parade in May.One source told the Sun: “He is incandescent that US and UK intelligence appear to know the Russian army’s next moves all the time, starting with predicting the invasion before he was ready to acknowledge it.Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov said military counterintelligence is probing an FSB security service department.  He told the New York Post: “So it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the US intelligence about the invasion, and why US intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming.” Soldatov also said part of the problem is high-ranking military personnel are so scared to tell Putin the truth, due to fear of being jailed, intelligence on the scale of Ukraine’s likely resistance to Russian invaders was hidden from him. However, he does not believe that the Russian President is in much danger of being assassinated by those in his inner circle. Putin was a former intelligence officer himself and so is well aware of how to manoeuvre risks, and has two separate security services ensuring his personal safety, he said.

White phosphorus munitions were deployed in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Monday, according to the deputy head of Kyiv’s police.Video taken on phones and by an ITV film crew showed a glittering light substance falling down from the sky onto the city below.Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a video of material burning fiercely on the ground as it was touched with a spade. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he says in the video. White phosphorous is used to cause rapid fires due to the aggressive way it combusts with oxygen.  The use of white phosphorus is not banned under international convention when it is used as a smoke screen, but as an incendiary weapons in civilian areas it is forbidden under the Geneva convention.There are rising fears that Vladimir Putin is considering turning to more extreme forms of attack and even chemical warfare as the now month long invasion stalls. At the weekend an alarming Russian propaganda video began circulating showing off terrying thermobaric rockets which can melt human organs. On Saturday Russian ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea launched cruise missile strikes on Ukraine and fired hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. One of the strikes destroyed a large fuel storage facility in the Nikolaev region in southern Ukraine, while another damaged a workshop used to repair armoured vehicles.US President Joe Biden said the use of chemical weapons was “a real threat” as he departed for Europe to attend a Nato summit on Wednesday. The US has also reiterated its warning that Russia could be about to stage a ‘ flag’ attack to justy using chemical weapons.Biden has previously said Russia’s claim that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a clear sign Mr Putin is considering using them. Nato head Jens Stoltenberg also warned that any use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would have far-reaching consequences and “totally change the nature of the conflict”.

However, he said he has had some close calls of late, including surviving a tank shelling while hiding inside a house.Wali joined the war effort soon after Vladimir Putin ordered the attack on February  and had been keeping followers on social up to date with what he was doing.But he has spent the last week in the Kyiv region, fighting alongside the Ukrainian Armed forces and his Canadian partner - and so has not been able to do as much blogging.  He said they have made some advancements against the enemy in terms of ground gained. But - despite his reputation - while others in his group have shot Russian soldiers, he has not registered any kills. Speaking on Tuesday, he said he is well-fed, rested and all good. He told Global News, he had just come off the frontlines when he heard he had died.“I was the last person to learn the news that I was dead,” he joked.Wali described the reports as trolling but said he finds such propaganda from Russia bizarre as he can now confirm itaposs not true and they lose credibility with their people.He is currently recovering from a cold and expects to be back out on the frontline in a few days.  “This war is like playing chess without knowing what the other pawns are. You know a bit but not enough, he told the news outlet. Wali described getting into engagement with Russian troops, who were just  metres away and aware of their position. He said: “I was in a house where they shot the room right beside me with shells from a tank, I was about three metres away. We were lucky.  Now I know how it feels to be engaged by a tank,” he added. One of his colleagues was shot on one their first patrols but was evacuated and has survived, Wali revealed. The sniper - who has a family back in Toronto - said he has spoken to his we in recent days and she understands he has been in black-out mode. He said the war is not like anything heaposs ever seen.  “It’s not like everything collapsed, there’s still internet. Most combat zones have no electricity and no water and it’s chaos, he explained. He said he went into central Kyiv on a patrol and stayed in an amazing condo with an espresso machine. However, he has seen far more distressing scenes, including Russians routinely shooting roaming domestic dogs for giving away positions by barking. And he also encountered an elderly woman and her cat who had not had any food for days.  Wali said the attacks undertaken by the Russians are far from sophisticated and the whole invasion effort has been amateur. He said they donapost have the capabilities of NATO forces, with the poor country reflected in its weapons. In comparison, the West has supplied Ukraine with more modern weapons and equipment, which has gone a long way to helping keep the invading troops at bay. Wali previously went viral after it was claimed he had taken the worldaposs longest sniper shot in Iraq in . But he has moved to quash the story, and confirmed he was never a member of JTF and was not present when the .km shot which killed an ISIS operative was fired.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition. Half are missing school. Millions are displaced. And none of them have ever known anything but war.One of my colleagues there, a -year-old man, tells me he has never seen peace in his letime.

This confirms that the timber has been grown in sustainable forests where young trees are replanted to replace the mature trees as they’re harvested.This is particularly important with hardwoods – unfortunately, there are still foreign governments who allow their rainforests to be cleared without replacing the trees that are so important for our global environment.Being a natural, organic material, part of the beauty of timber is seeing it mature. It will absorb water when it rains and dry out when the sun shines and the fibres of the timber will change, expanding and contracting as moisture levels y.Customers often worry when they see this movement but it is natural and what you’re seeing is simply part of the ageing process that all living organisms undergo. If it doesn’t affect the structural integrity of your furniture, there’s no cause for concern!The lespan of timber furniture ies greatly. Some pine benches may last a few years whilst a good teak piece can last in excess of  years. As with all furniture, much will depend on how you care for it, ensuring it doesn’t sit for prolonged periods in water, protecting it from the worst of the elements, especially over winter.Treating wooden furniture is often an aesthetic choice, whilst many customers prefer to see the timber mature naturally.Metal FurnitureAmongst the most common metals used in garden furniture are cast iron, stainless steel and aluminium. Whilst each metal may y in quality , you’ll generally find that cast iron is cheapest, with aluminium the most expensive.Cast iron tends to be very heavy and has a ‘chunky’ look, reminiscent of lovely old-fashioned garden furniture. Its weight makes it very stable in the garden but it does require maintenance to prevent corrosion as that could eventually weaken the structure.Stainless steel is lighter than cast iron and is valued for its strength, robustness, durability and resistance to corrosion. It’s often used as the frame of the furniture rather than the finished, outer coat.Although generally the most expensive, aluminium is an ideal metal for garden furniture. Lightweight, strong, robust and long-lasting, it withstands the elements well and requires minimal maintenance.Rattan or wicker FurnitureSynthetic rattan or wicker has overtaken the use of their natural equivalents because they are longer-lasting, easier to maintain and available in a wide range of colours, textures and shapes.There’s an enormous iation in quality and price but a quick look at the warranty is usually a good initial indication of what you’re being offered.Another factor affecting the price of rattan furniture is the size and shape of the weave.There are three main profiles – flat, half-round and round – with the flat generally being cheapest and the round being dearest.Depending on the look you want, the half-round and round profile will offer texture and depth to your furniture, whilst the flat weave offers a smoother, more even surface.Rattan can fade and deteriorate from the UV rays in the sunlight and the UV warranty of the product is also an important indication of quality.WarrantyNow you’ve chosen your perfect furniture, take a moment to check how the manufacturer recommends you care for your furniture – it is an investment and certainly worth taking care of!Remember that furniture can be made from a combination of materials and each component – for example, the frame and cushions – are likely to have dferent warranties.Finally…In this column we’re only able to offer a quick overview of some of the things to look for when choosing your garden furniture, but staff in reputable garden centres will be able to advise you in more detail and help you choose the best solution for you and your family.The internet is a handy way to start considering your options and indeed you’re very welcome to have a preview of our garden furniture online at merryhattonHowever, we strongly recommend that you always see the products in-store to get a feel for the comfort and quality before buying.That’s the best way to make an informed choice – and avoid an expensive mistake!More information is available at merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"three-venues-confirmed-covid-booster-jags","story":"The vaccination will be available by appointment to those aged  and over, immunosuppressed people and those living in care homes.People will be invited as they become eligible from about  weeks after their last booster.Musselburgh Primary Care Centre is open from .am to .pm, Monday to Friday, and vaccinations will be given by appointment only.Haddington’s Corn Exchange is open for vaccinations – appointment or drop-in – also between .am and .pm, Monday to Friday.A drop-in service is available to those aged  and over who require first or second Covid jags or a first booster.Children aged -

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

A key element of the Review was to gain insights from interested stakeholders and the wider public on the future of rail on the island of Ireland. With over , responses to the consultation, both Ministers received an update from consultants ARUP on the initial findings from this phase of the Review at a progress meeting today.  Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy. The benefits of enhanced rail connections cross Ireland will improve lives and have signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our environment. I believe that this is our chance to deliver real and lasting change. I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review. The incredible public response has shown the importance of rail for regional accessibility and demonstrated wide support for sustainable public transport. The public and stakeholders’ ambitions for the future of passenger and freight rail transport will play a signicant role in the future work of the Review, informing concepts to enhance the rail network and, in doing so, enhance connectivity, drive decarbonisation and support sustainable social and economic development. “Minister Mallon and I are committed to increasing low-carbon mobility and regional accessibility.

The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government."},{"url":null,"title":"families in northern ireland playing russian roulette with young kids lives as 98 go unvaccinated","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Exactly a fortnight later, he passed away.His daughter, Cathy Costello, said the hardest thing was not having people he knew and loved with him in hospital.Cathy’s brother – Laurence’s son Declan – died seven months earlier from a heart attack. Restricted numbers were permitted at the wake and funeral.Laurence was  years old, but fit and strong for his age.His daughter Cathy believes “ he hadn’t got Covid, he’d be doing well – he had a good few years ahead of him”.It was bittersweet for her family when Tyrone won the All-Ireland title last September.James, who said he had considered “not going back to football” when Laurence passed, was persuaded to go to the final that day with a friend, but it was an emotional event for all.Laurence’s other son, Conleth, has a poignant memory of his dad being at Tyrone’s winning All-Ireland final in .“After the game was over, he gave me a hug but there was a couple in front of us from Kerry with a young lad of about eight years old, and he was balling and crying.“My father leaned over and he said, ‘Listen, you will win many more. I might never see another one’.”And sadly, he never did.Read More‘I’ve found the whole perception over death from Covid disrespectful – Basil was my brother, people have been so dismissive of his death’Most ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familyNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a stingRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseSuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoLatest CoronavirusFamilies in Northern Ireland ‘playing Russian roulette with young kids’ lives’ as % go unvaccinated against CovidLisa SmythOpinionTwo years on and the world is still living under the shadow of CovidWhat are the Deltacron and Stealth Omicron strains as Covid cases rise in Northern Ireland Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageOscars : Anxious wait for Covid-hit Ken Branagh and Ciaran Hinds with hopes pinned on BelfastLatestProsecutions launched over Croydon tram crashKatherine Brunt keen to avoid more grey hairs as England target comfortable winsNext faces £ million sales hit over Russia and Ukraine closuresRussian stock market resumes trading after being crushed by warLack of low-income support pushes . million into poverty, think tank says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has been nominated twice for the Royal Television Society award for presenter of the year.More recently, she made cameo appearances reading news bulletins in the hit Channel  comedy Derry Girls.Announcing her departure on Twitter, she said: “It is with deep sadness that, after almost  years, I am leaving the job that I love and resigning from BBC Northern Ireland with immediate effect.“Because this is the subject of ongoing tribunal and other legal proceedings, I am not able to respond to any questions or comments about my reason for leaving the organisation.”It is thought the journalist would no longer be the first-choice presenter for the flagship Newsline programme and would also have been required to work on Radio Ulster shows. Read MoreDonna Traynor back on the BBC – but as a character in comedy Give My Head PeaceDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsMost ReadBBC bids to keep Donna Traynor talks out of public domainCost of living crisis: Young Belfast mum in tears over using food banks to feed familyNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a stingRoyal visit: Curtain call for Prince Charles at Belfast’s Grand Opera HouseSuzanne BreenOpinionDUP faces nightmare scenarios in Assembly polls as expectations are scaled backTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo: Malawian #prophet# appears to #walk on air# in a ridiculous but hilarious videoLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland set for #problems and confusion# over a clash between UK and EU law, Government admitsLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPZero emission electric bus fleet arriving in BelfastSinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsPlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdogLatestNext faces £ million sales hit over Russia and Ukraine closuresRussian stock market resumes trading after being crushed by warLack of low-income support pushes . million into poverty, think tank saysFootball rumours: Newcastle rule out making move for Paris St Germain’s Neymar‘Like twins separated at birth’: How two Belfast colleagues saw series of coincidences lead their children to finally become friends,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

Nearing the age of , I visited the United States for the first time in my le. Prior to leaving I spoke to a few people about what to expect. A number of the conversations were startlingly similar.‘What you need to know is that you have to tip everyone in the US.’    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I have always had problems with the concept of tipping. To be clear, not the principle, but the practicality.I hate having the responsibility of having to decide how much to give, not wanting to appear either cheap or overly extravagant. I would much rather the burden is taken off me and the additional charge simply added to the service. I find myself in a taxi on the way to central Washington DC. I am telling myself over and over ‘don’t forget the tip…don’t forget the tip’.I nervously am keeping an eye on the meter. If it stays below  then should I give the driver   I have no small notes and I worry thatit goes too far in excess of  then I’m going to have to give . I arrive at the hotel and a nice man brings my heavy case to the room. I am discombobulated by the stress and strange environment. He finishes the job and smiles at me. I smile back. He smiles some more, although there may be a trace of a grimace there. ‘Oh, the tip, I’m so sorry, hang on,’ I say in a panic as I fumble with my wallet.But what is the etiquette for tipping someone who wheels my suitcase  Should I give       The trip continues with me in this constant state of uncertain anxiety. I can’t find the light switch in the bathroom and have to call for help . Do I need to tip  Breakfast in this hotel is a DIY affair and I’m trying to set the microwave for three minutes to cook an egg muffin. On my first attempt it runs for three seconds. On my second, I set it to run for three hours. A kindly woman intervenes to help. Do I need to tip  One of the porters is a corpulent and jolly fellow. Each time he sees me, he beams with enthusiasm.‘How are you today sir ’ he exclaims. I enjoy this form of good-natured banter.‘Why I’m just dandy. How are you today my good man ’ I respond gaily. ‘I am simply wonderful. You have a good day sir.’‘No, you have a good day.’ ‘No, you have a good day!’ And so it continues. But after a couple of days of this I begin to worry that I might be expected to tip him for displaying such extravagant enthusiasm and jollity. I see him in the lobby the next morning. ‘Good morning sir, how are you on this fine day ’ he begins. ‘Mmm, ok,’ I mumble, staring at the floor. I feel ashamed when I notice the hurt look in his eyes as he walks away.I struggle to sleep at night in the unfamiliar room, troubled by the ongoing pressure of delivering appropriate tips.When I do grab some moments of kip, I have unquiet dreams where the words ‘you need to tip everyone’ keep going around and around in my head.I tip the barman, the receptionist and the woman who comes to clean my room. After a while I notice that the hotel staff seem to be overly eager to lend me as much assistance as possible.I am ing to the hotel in a taxi one night when, after paying and tipping the driver, I strike my head on the corner of the car boot as I collect my belongings .Although I’m dazed, I try to pretend that nothing has happened. That is until the concierge in the lobby sympathetically points out that I have blood gushing down my face. Do I need to tip him The tipping mania continues outside the hotel. I go to a - to buy a sandwich. I pay by card and the machine asks meI want to leave a tip for %, %, % or more. I just wanted a sandwich.It is the same when I try to buy a gt for my son from a toy store. I am in the shop for just a few minutes and am tempted to hit the button on the machine which indicates no tip. However, I look up and the harsh eyes of the retail assistant are watching every move. I leave a % tip and flee.I am walking back to the hotel and struggling to get across a busy road. A driver slows down and waves me to proceed. Should I tip her A man is sitting on the pavement and asks meI have any change. I fish a few dollars out of my wallet and hand them to him. I’m about to walk on, but then I remember where I am. I take the wallet back out and give him another  cents.On this working trip one of my responsibilities is to attend an event where the US President Joe Biden will make a speech. The security is ferocious, and I have to queue for more than an hour just to get access to the grand building.When it is finally my turn, I experience the most thorough security inspection I have ever undergone. My pockets and emptied and all the contents inidually examined.My rucksack is opened and emptied. The security man turns on my laptop, presumably to ensure that it is indeed a laptop and not a bomb. I am told I am not allowed to bring my video camera into the building, and it has to be left outside.Then, he turns to my wallet. By this point in the trip I have stuffed the wallet with so many  and  notes that I cannot fasten the buckle.The security man insists on taking out the large wad of small notes and going through them all inidually to ensure that there is nothing concealed between them. This takes some time and I can hear growls of impatience and frustration from the crowd behind me.‘Gee sir, you sure do have a lot of  bills,’ the security man says.‘Well... you know, it’s for the tips,’ I say, realising immediately how stupid I sound.He continues to examine my wallet. I wonderI should tell him to just help himself to a tip.More from the News Letter: Click here: Landmark libel win: Paper Trail case against News Letter collapses with plaintfs paying towards costsClick here for more opinion and letters: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHERE are the main points from Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement:Mr Sunak said by the end of the current Parliament in , the Government would cut the basic rate of income tax from p in the pound to p which he said was “fully costed and fully paid for in the plans announced today”.The Chancellor said he would “stand by” households, and announced fuel duty would be cut by p per litre for a year up until March .Mr Sunak said that “thanks to Brexit” he was able to remove VAT on materials such as solar , heat pumps or insulation to help bring down energy costs, as well as on wind and water turbines. He told the Commons: “We will abolish all the red tape imposed on us by the EU.”He also said he is doubling the Household Support Fund to £ billion “to do more to help our most vulnerable households with rising costs” with “targeted support”.The Chancellor said he would publish a “tax plan” as he announced the national insurance contributionsthreshold would rise by £, “to fully equalise the Nics and income tax thresholds not incrementally over many years but in one go this year”.Hoping to prompt a new “culture of enterprise”, Mr Sunak said there would be tax cuts “on business investment and innovation with final decisions to be announced in the autumn Budget” and a reform of research and development tax credits.The employment allowance for small businesses will rise to £,, the Chancellor said.Mr Sunak focused on “security”, linking having a strong economy to standing up Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. He said what underpins the security enjoyed in the UK was “the strength of our economy” which he said the Government has a “moral responsibility” to use to support Ukraine.He warned, however that sanctions on Russia “of unprecedented scale and scope” would have an impact on the economy, saying they “are not cost-free for us at home” and were “a risk to our recovery”.He told the Commons that The Office for Budget Responsibility has downgraded the growth forecast for this year to . per cent.But Mr Sunak said downgraded growth forecasts had “not affected our strong jobs performance” as he said unemployment was back to levels seen before the pandemic.The Government is “meeting all our fiscal rules”, Mr Sunak said, but he added the nation must prepare for “the economy and public finances to worsen, potentially signicantly” because of the impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The cost of borrowing is set to continue to rise. The Chancellor said £ billion will be spent on debt interest, “the highest on record and almost four times the amount we spent last year”.Mr Sunak said underlying debt is expected to fall steadily from . per cent of GDP in   to . per cent in  . He added borrowing as a percentage of GDP is . per cent this year, . per cent next year, then . per cent, . per cent, . per cent and . per cent in the following years. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log "},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/20016828.football-rumours-newcastle-rule-making-move-paris-st-germains-neymar/res","title":"football rumours newcastle rule making move paris st germains neymar","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularBlack Paths from Lurgan through Craigavon to Portadown and L...NewsTyrone pharmacist running gruelling desert race in memory of...NewsVisitors’ upset as Lough Neagh Discovery Centre’s cafe downg...NewsDrone footage and photos shows effect of first COVID Lockd...NewsLarne shop hosts Flossy as part of campaign for more acces...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A key element of the Review was to gain insights from interested stakeholders and the wider public on the future of rail on the island of Ireland. With over , responses to the consultation, both Ministers received an update from consultants ARUP on the initial findings from this phase of the Review at a progress meeting today.  Minister Nichola Mallon said: “Minister Ryan and I have a shared ambition for rail and are committed to improving our network for citizens across the island through our All Island Strategic Rail Review. The public consultation phase was a vital step in delivering this important piece of work and I am delighted to have delivered this key stage. Today we met with the consultants at ARUP, along with Minister Ryan to hear the out-workings of the consultation, to understand the views of the public and stakeholders and to ensure that their priorities are a focal point of the Review as it moves forward. “With over , responses received, this highlights that this work is long overdue and has captured the imagination of the public across the whole island. In that regard, the consultation has clearly demonstrated that our citizens view decarbonisation and enhancing connectivity as key components of this Review and these factors will play a strong role as we move forward to the next stage. “Minister Ryan and I have ensured now that working in partnership the next steps will move at pace. The next phase now will see ARUP analyse the comments and feedback received to ensure that the final report fully considers the views of our citizens when published by the end of the year. “This is an exciting opportunity for people, communities and our island economy. The benefits of enhanced rail connections cross Ireland will improve lives and have signicant benefits that a better connected island could bring not just to people but also for our environment. I believe that this is our chance to deliver real and lasting change. I’m proud that in government, Minister Ryan and I have shown that working together in the interests of people works and I hope we can continue working closely to see delivery on our aspirations for all island rail.” Minister Ryan said:“I’m delighted with the progress of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review.

The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcecbcdaebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddebeababafd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
