Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Our writer reveals her role in a huge projectOne sunny morning in late May, I piled 275 fortune cookies in metallic scarlet wrappers on to a bench in front of my home. They took up the same amount of space a small curled-up person might. The street is busy with foot traffic and I wondered if anyone passing would be bold enough to take one. It requires trust to accept something from a stranger, even without Covid-19. Given the risk of infection, I imagined most of the cookies would remain where I’d placed them, a shiny red sculpture – until 5 July, when I was due to remove them.\u0026nbspThat same week, piles of fortune cookies appeared at hundreds of locations worldwide: on the waterfront in Havana at an airport terminal in Shanghai in a convenience store in Brooklyn scattered through a forest in Finland sitting on a modified postbox in Iowa stabled with a horse called Fargo in Florida put in a closed museum in Maryland in a Rio de Janeiro flat overlooking Ipanema Beach and at a community kitchen in Buenos Aires.\u0026nbspIn the weeks since, the cookies have been dispersed, carried off, consumed, their fortunes read and their wrappers discarded. My batch lasted three days. On 14 June, they and the other piles around the world will “regenerate” and the process will start again.\u0026nbspThis is not a social experiment. Or perhaps it is. But primarily, it’s a work of art called Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) by the late Cuban-born American artist Félix González-Torres. The global exhibition of this single work has been orchestrated, in the space of three weeks, by a team led by his gallerist, Andrea Rosen. In 1990, Rosen opened her space in New York’s Soho with a González-Torres show. After 27 years, she closed the gallery to focus on his estate and namesake foundation.\u0026nbspWatching galleries and museums struggling to establish online content in the early days of lockdown, it occurred to Rosen that González-Torres’s work could help people hungering for encounters with art in actual physical space. “It is possible,” she says, “to have a real experience with his work in isolation.”Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) exists as a set of core tenets. It is built anew with every showing. Rosen’s team sent 1,000 invitees a list of parameters for installing the work, such as: “Each participant will source the fortune cookies that they use.” González-Torres stated that whenever possible “fortune cookies with optimistic fortunes should be used” and “iniduals must be allowed to take pieces from the work”. Participants were asked to share photos and thoughts, too.The work was first shown, or staged, in 1990, two years after González-Torres’s lover Ross Laycock was diagnosed as HIV positive. Laycock died in 1991. Later, González-Torres would describe how it had been to watch illness consume the body of the man he loved: “This beautiful, incredible body, this entity of perfection just physically, thoroughly disappearing right in front of your eyes.”In 1988, González-Torres started producing a series of perfect, beautiful forms that would disperse and disappear. Stacks of posters, installed in a gallery as minimalist blocks, would shrink over the course of an exhibition as visitors helped themselves.\u0026nbspUntitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) was itself followed by similar works: piles of wrapped sweets, in various configurations, offered for the taking.Some, such as Untitled (Lover Boys) and Untitled (Ross) commenced with a weight of sweets relating to a body. Untitled (Ross) was 81kg, the same the weight as González-Torres’s dead lover. Lover Boys was the weight of two adult men combined. This creates a relationship between the sweets and the men’s bodies. You are invited to eat them, with all the sexual suggestion that carries. There is, too, a hint of the Catholic sacrament:\u0026nbsptake, eat, this is my body.The cookies also carry hope: a promise of future events in the message they contain. I discussed all this with my neighbours while I watered window boxes and wrestled bins. I told them I thought this was a work about infection and the taboo of touch: in 1990, it was the fear of Aids. Now, in the midst of another health crisis, it takes on new associations.I’ve been in touch with artists who feel uncomfortable about the project’s global manifestation. Some find it too public and performative. They dislike the show-off Instagram posts from participants cooing over the honour of being invited. One said that it felt like a marketing exercise another that he wanted to know how Rosen decided who to invite. I asked Rosen. She reeled off a long list: collectors, curators, people who had posted about González-Torres on Instagram, family, friends, attendants and administrators who had overseen his work in museums. “We worked really hard to make it as erse as possible,” she says. “But it had to be people we had some kind of access to.”I write at a table overlooking the street. During Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner), I could hear neighbours proudly explaining the work to friends. Sometimes people came to fill carrier bags. An elderly Asian couple laughed at the fortune cookies, then noticed the Jeremy Deller poster in my window saying “Thank God for Immigrants” and decided the two were connected. Scandinavian teenagers dared one another to take a cookie then ran off giggling. Strangers took photos. I had no control over how the artwork was understood or received. Everyone who encountered this unexpected cookie mountain in these weird times interpreted it their own way. I hope, on some level, they understood the gesture as I think González-Torres intended it: beautiful, generous and bittersweet.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaef3144cbdfc0b5cd8b3cb6c97d6324eb83a884/0_1629_5136_3080/master/5136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2430a563772d96eea4655e01d13ecd48","title":"great british art quiz yale center for british art","story":"Yale Center for British Art set today’s quiz, which enables you to explore the art collections of museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Decades of imitators have only succeeded in making its singular magic more potent.\u0026nbspEmily Temple’s first novel, The Lightness, is one of the more preposterous Secret History facsimiles: in place of hedonistic scholars, Temple gives us nihilistic Buddhists on a quest to master the dark and furtive art of levitation. It is a premise that requires a mighty belief in suspension in order to suspend disbelief.\u0026nbspSixteen-year-old Olivia has run away (“if you can really call it running away when you leave plain tracks and credit card receipts and no one bothers to come after you”). She’s taken herself to a geographically elusive, “pan-spiritual contemplative community” for high-altitude, high-end soul searching. It’s the last place her father visited before he vanished, and, according to legend, is “the only bit of land left in America where levitation was still possible, at least for those with the correct set of aptitudes”.\u0026nbspOlivia arrives in time for a Buddhist boot camp, the kind of course wealthy parents impose on their unruly daughters. And how rhapsodically “bad” these girls seem to be: “They were slick-finish girls, cat-eye girls, hot-blood girls. They were girls who revelled ... They were girls who left marks. They were girls who snuck.” Yet up on the mountain they dutifully take classes in Japanese flower arranging and Zen archery, do their chores and eat kale by the ladleful. Occasionally they glower at each other across the dining hall. It must be all the thin mountain air.\u0026nbspThe grand exception is an imperious trio of rule breakers: there’s athletic Janet with her purple hair soft and sensual Laurel, “an idiot savant for secrets” and ringleader Serena, who speaks in kōans and has her “cold-mirror heart” set on the ultimate act of transcendence. Together they lounge in Serena’s elaborately cushioned tent, eating almonds, drinking whiskey and practising ASMR techniques.Serena is a folkloric creature around whom elaborate rumours swirl: witch, werewolf, virgin, slut. The consensus is she’s not to be approached. But Serena seems to recognise something kindred in painfully self-aware Olivia, and Olivia convinces herself that levitation is the way she will find her missing father. “If I did what he did, loved what he loved, believed what he believed, I too might be transformed. Into what exactly, I didn’t know ... a girl worth coming back for.”For guidance in the art of being insubstantial, the girls turn to Luke, a twentysomething gardener with a luxurious topknot, mythic cheekbones and “strong digging arms” – a hipster incarnation of Lady Chatterley’s smouldering lover. The Lightness does not need its ceaseless foreshadowing for us to intuit that things will not end well. After all, Luke lives in a cabin in the woods, and “when, pray tell, has any little girl ever found anything good in a cabin in the woods?”\u0026nbspAnd so let us play a round of The Secret History bingo. An ungainly cipher of a narrator check. A sleek clique of gorgeously broken young people check. An ethereal bubble of unfettered privilege check. A quest for transcendent oblivion that turns menacing bingo. There is even a cheeky suggestion in the book’s final pages that Temple’s floating fairytale exists in a similar universe to Tartt’s New England Greek tragedy. But while The Secret History was a novel of soul-curdling aftermaths, bisected by its murder, The Lightness is simply a novel of a looming bad thing. And we know the rough shape the bad thing will take from the novel’s very first page. “A suicide, they said. Nothing to suggest otherwise. If not a suicide, perhaps an accident. The steep cliff, the shifting rocks.”\u0026nbspWhere The Lightness does carry weight is in its scenes away from the mountain and its manic pixie dream friends, as we watch Olivia’s family disintegrate: her artist mother who creates voluptuous sculptures of women out of steel her aloof father who wears blue tinted contacts over his blue eyes for extra dazzle. It’s here that Temple shows us why Olivia might yearn to be untethered.\u0026nbspIt is hard to shake the lurking sense – the hope – that The Lightness might reveal itself to be a sublimely subversive satire a much-needed parody of our abiding literary fetishisation of girlhood, with all of its idolatrous hunger and coiled sensuality, or perhaps a scabrous caricature of pumpkin spice spirituality. Temple’s description of the mountaintop centre, with its grab bag of courses from iridology to tantric sex, has promising raw-toothed bite. “I’ve come to be suspicious of American practitioners of Eastern philosophies,” grown-up Olivia confides. “There’s something so rapacious about them ... All that performative kindness. All that practised calm.”\u0026nbspWhich is why it is so dispiriting that her novel opts instead for a twee permutation of a story we have seen so many times before. The Lightness leads us to the precipice, but when it comes time to make a bold literary leap, it loses its nerve.•\u0026nbspThe Lightness is published by Borough Press (RRP £14.99).

It is hoping a mix of virtual experiences and live entertainments – such as DJs – will help shoppers feel no less pampered.“We will be bringing a little bit more life and a joyful experience for customers who come to our stores,” said Meave Wall, the stores director of Selfridges.The retailer’s online sales have doubled since its stores closed when the UK went into lockdown. Treats including lipstick and lingerie as well as kit for lockdown life, including loungewear and kitchen accessories, have proved particularly popular.Food orders have also surged after the retailer widely promoted its food hall delivery service, previously the preserve of those in the know, so that shoppers within the M25 can order in.But the closure of all stores in London, Manchester and Birmingham has dealt a blow to overall sales.“I can’t wait to put on my heels and get back out there,” says Wall.The store has had time to hone its plans after opening the London food hall five weeks ago – with queues of customers waiting outside despite the low-key launch.The food hall’s greengrocer, bakery, butcher and greengrocer have enjoyed steady trade from local shoppers in Mayfair during lockdown and have branched out with new ideas including meal kits for pizza and tacos.The full reopening of the department stores – as non-essential retailers are allowed to welcome customers once again from Monday – will be heralded by window displays going up this week under the theme of “thank you”. Staff have contributed to giant thank-you cards for the displays that will refer to family members, key workers or others who have supported them.“We have given creativity over to our team across the stores and some of the input has been extraordinary,” Wall says.From 15 June, it will be possible to book personal shopping appointments for fashion or beauty – held either via video calls or after hours in the store where advisers will keep to the two-metre physical distancing rule. Store opening hours will be slightly reduced from 11am to 7pm in London, and similar times elsewhere and appointments can be booked for an hour before opening and an hour after closing.Unlike many fashion stores, Selfridges will also be reopening at least some of its changing rooms – with staff on hand to sanitise surfaces and steam-clean items that have been tried on. Items that can’t be steamed will be quarantined for a minimum of three days.Shoppers will be allowed to browse products in stores, with cleaners or shop assistants regularly wiping down surfaces.

Apologies. The agenda has since been updated) Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world, according to a report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Phillip Inman writes.Highlighting the task awaiting the UK government as it seeks to ease the lockdown, the OECD ruled out a V-shaped recovery for the global economy, saying the path back to previous levels of activity would be hampered by long-lasting effects of the pandemic.You can watch the live OECD press conference here: OECD forecasts are out and it’s not a pretty picture. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has criticised the British bank HSBC for supporting China’s move to end Hong Kong’s autonomy, calling it a “corporate kowtow”.Pompeo said the US was ready to assist Britain with whatever it needed after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and break its commitments to build nuclear power plants in the country if the UK did not allow the Chinese technology firm Huawei to build its 5G network.“The United States stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist party’s coercive bullying tactics,” Pompeo said in a statement.He added that displays of support for Beijing received little in return, although the Chinese government “continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London”.Pompeo said China’s treatment of HSBC was a “cautionary tale” and referred to the bank’s Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong’s decision to sign a petition supporting Beijing’s plans to enact new security legislation in Hong Kong:The CCP’s browbeating of HSBC, in particular, should serve as a cautionary tale. Just last week, the bank’s Asia-Pacific CEO, Peter Wong, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, signed a petition supporting Beijing’s disastrous decision to destroy Hong Kong’s autonomy and to break commitments made in an U.N.-registered treaty. That show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London.Let’s catch up with some of the Chinese inflation data released overnight which has also weighed on Asian stocks. Both the consumer price index and producer price index figures pointed to a drop in demand last month. But Robert Alster, head of investment services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, said there were some indications of a further rebound:China was ground-zero for the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, but it also appears to be leading the global recovery. Auto sales data looks to be strengthening, and with some factory levels almost back to pre-pandemic levels there is a real hope that the worst is in the rear-view mirror. Its role at the heart of the global economy has meant that Chinese inflation has historically acted as an indicator for other countries. It remains to be seen whether that’s still the case in this new environment, where local effects will play a more prominent role in the basket of goods.Hurdles remain for the global recovery, with recent reports that logjams could be on the horizon for the shipping industry and emerging economies projected to shrink for the first time in sixty years. But as the US shows signs of greater bouncebackability, governments and central banks around the world will have their fingers crossed that a v-shaped recovery could be on the cards.”The owner of dozens of magazines including The Week, Minecraft World and Viz has put a quarter of its UK staff into a redundancy consultation process as the coronavirus crisis hammers the publishing industry, the ’s Mark Sweney writes.Dennis Publishing, the company founded by the late media entrepreneur Felix Dennis, has begun a consultation process with 122 of its approximately 480 UK staff. The company is understood to be seeking to cut just over half of those staff involved in the consultation.The company, which was sold to private equity group Exponent two years ago for £166m, has a portfolio of titles mainly in the technology, fitness and cycling sectors. Brands range from Cyclist and Expert Reviews to Fortean Times and an unofficial guide to global phenomenon Fortnite.A spokesman for the company said: The impact of Covid-19 has been significant for the publishing sector.As a result, this week we will begin a redundancy consultation process here in the UK.

While we’re nowhere near some of the gains we’ve seen in recent weeks, all major indices are in positive territory: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business.Market headlines were dominated last night by news that the Nasdaq hit 10,000 for the first time and that US stocks had actually logged gains for 2020 overall. But the stunning recovery has not reverberated throughout global equity markets, which have not had the benefit of being home to lucrative tech stocks that have rallied as Covid-19 lockdowns took hold. But all eyes are now turning to the US Federal Reserve, which will give its first economic projections since the pandemic started to hit the US in February. Their estimates are expected to point to a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years.(It’s worth noting that the Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold today, hence why most attention is aimed at the forecasts.)Growing tensions in Hong Kong have also weighed on investor sentiment, with stocks across Asia falling broadly into the red in Wednesday’s session. More than 50 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after thousands of protesters took to the streets in defiance of a police order to mark the first anniversary of the anti-government movement.

In Liverpool, where I live, we are back to square one, with an “R” rate estimated to be hovering at or just over 1. That means the vast majority of people have been staying indoors, not sending their children to school, or seeing their friends and family for nearly three months, only to find that coronavirus, and the risk of transmitting it to others, is still in circulation. Now what?Our household of four – two home-working adults, two primary-school age children – is augmented in normal times by many regular visitors. I know from my own early experiences that nuclear families contain pressures and unspoken traumas that can only be relieved by constant engagement\u0026nbspwith the outside world, but the March lockdown enforced that rigid nuclear model almost without warning.We’ve stayed in our bubble, believing it to be temporary, and were doing all right in lockdown for a good eight weeks, blessed with good weather and a decent back yard, in spite of a troubling suspicion that Zoom calls might come to be regarded as satisfactory replacements for real-world relationships. At times the lockdown has only seemed possible to endure because our household has the resources to make it tolerable.Then the government’s message changed, to the effect that it was the responsibility of inidual households not only to maintain social relationships virtually, to educate children and to keep the economy running, but also to “control the virus”. I started to wonder whether there was a method – however buried, however unconscious – in this. After all, who needs society – and its attendant systems of social support – when you’ve got nuclear families and stoic iniduals?\u0026nbspCommon action depends on social life. Whenever people are ordered to retreat from physical society it’s necessary to ask for whom, and for what purpose, they are doing it. At the start the answer was clear: it was for each other, and it was for the NHS. But, then, the hospitals – in most cases – weren’t overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Intensive care units, for the most part, were never full. A\u0026ampE departments emptied overnight, and the Nightingale hospitals were almost never used.It became clear over April and May that thousands of people were dying during this crisis from\u0026nbspcauses other than coronavirus.\u0026nbspTo give an example, 10,000 more people with dementia have died than would normally die in the same time period, over and above those with dementia who are known have died with Covid-19. They may have died because, to put it bluntly,\u0026nbspan attempt to prioritise the quantity of their lives over the quality has disastrously backfired.\u0026nbspMy dad, 75 this week, has dementia, and moved into a care home near my house last year. His home is one of a handful in Liverpool that has had no infections so far and, understandably, its staff want to keep it that way. But he’s getting more confused. He hasn’t been outside the home since 22 March. Since my visits have been limited to a quick wave from the porch when I drop off his Guinness and crisps, he\u0026nbspspends most of the day asleep and is gradually losing any sense of time and its significance.For how much longer can we be said to be protecting the elderly – and all vulnerable people – during the pandemic while making so little provision for them to be included in society?\u0026nbspBoth the government and its scientific advisers know that reducing infections in care homes is necessary to prevent a second wave. But what we know is that, throughout the pandemic, the Tories have been consumed with treating a public health crisis as an exercise in political management, resulting in a social and economic crisis of a scale that it shows little interest in acknowledging, let alone addressing.\u0026nbspThe government’s\u0026nbspsolution\u0026nbspto isolation and unemployment is to re-open garden centres, “non-essential” shops and beer gardens. There have been no major media splashes on re-opening libraries, swimming pools and public toilets, nor government attempts to find – or fund – ways for schools to recommence lessons using outdoor spaces, or for care homes to allow physical visitors.\u0026nbspThe best we have to show for 40 years of “baseline economic growth”, it seems, is a pathological aversion to the civic sphere.The result is a lockdown twilight zone, where public life and private spirits continue to wither while the idea of being able to go to Next in a car is presented as a return to the kind of normality most people have said they don’t even want. In other words, it’s the worst of both worlds, offering neither the certainty of “stay at home, save lives” nor the messy reality of everyday public life. It underscores and contributes to inequalities that already exist and bends us towards a society based on turning inwards rather than outwards.In such circumstances, where people from black and ethnic minority groups have a vastly higher mortality risk from Covid-19, it’s galvanising and heartening to see Black Lives Matter protests taking place at a time when we are being told to stay in, indefinitely, unless we have a risky job to go to or have an overwhelming urge to buy some compost.\u0026nbspProtesters have one clear message: we refuse to live like this, and we refuse to die like this.\u0026nbspThe coronavirus crisis has widened to expose the effects of social marginality and inequality, and the ways in which race and class work in tandem to compound disadvantage in multiple and lethal forms. Had it taken the pandemic and its repercussions seriously in the first place, the government could have avoided stumbling into an endless semi-lockdown that will put more lives at risk and make countless others miserable.\u0026nbsp• Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36e4941ecf4df2378e102a38b5866e4d688b425/98_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a2af32ce6374f71ef77cf2a45937e25","title":"conspiracies covid 19 lab false pandemic","story":"Instead of following false claims, we should be focusing our efforts on the regions where the next pandemic is likely to emerge• Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemicsIn a recent interview with the , the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove cited an “important” scientific report that suggested that the novel coronavirus had not emerged naturally, but had been created by Chinese scientists. Dearlove said he believed the pandemic had “started as an accident” after the virus escaped the lab. A month earlier, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had said he had “enormous evidence” that Covid-19 had originated in a lab in China, only to backtrack from this claim on live TV in the same sentence.Suggestions that Covid-19 is a manmade virus are the latest chapter in a tale of blame, misinformation and finger-pointing. Cue the conspiracy theorists, marching out their narrative about the high-security BSL-4 lab in Wuhan, where mysterious experiments to design “frankenviruses” led to the tragic global pandemic. Cue the genetic analyses pointing to “unexpected” insertions in the code of A, G, T, and C that explain how this virus could not have evolved naturally. Cue political posturing against China, with calls for an inquiry, trade sanctions and even reparations.Determining the origins and emergence of a pandemic is as messy and complex as studying a plane crash. Just as an air crash investigator pieces together fragments at a crash site, pinpointing the origins of a new virus is painstakingly difficult and time-consuming, and requires logic and reason. I know, because this is exactly what our organisation, EcoHealth Alliance, does. We work around the world to identify the origins of pandemics, map them and analyse them, and use these results to predict where the next pandemic will likely emerge. We then target these “hotspots” for enhanced surveillance, capacity-building and risk-reduction programmes to prevent diseases emerging.We have spent the past 15 years working in China to analyse the group of viruses from which Sars and now Covid-19 have emerged. Sampling more than 16,000 bats, we showed that Sars emerged from a cluster of coronaviruses carried by horseshoe bats that are abundant across southern and central China and traded frequently in wet markets. We found Sars-related viruses that could infect human cells in the lab, cause diseases in lab animals, and evade drugs and vaccines designed to protect us. We worked with the scientists behind the breakthrough drug Remdesivir to show that it was effective against known human coronaviruses and the viruses we suspected might be the next to emerge. We raised the red flag on these viruses and pointed out their potential to cause the next pandemic.\u0026nbspOur 15 years of work in China now puts us in a unique position to identify, with a remarkable degree of confidence, the likely origin of Covid-19. We recently published a peer-reviewed paper reporting 781 genetic sequences of bat-origin coronaviruses previously unknown to scientists. These include the closest known relatives to Sars-CoV, Sars-CoV-2 and Sads-CoV, a virus that killed more than 25,000 pigs in Guangdong in 2016 and 2017. All are carried by horseshoe bats that are found across southern China and neighbouring countries. Our report firmly concludes that Covid-19 originated in bats, in a hotspot of viral evolution along the border of Yunnan province in China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.\u0026nbspMost people (including former heads of intelligence agencies) aren’t trained in how to decipher genetic codes, so we have to assess the rigour of competing research to determine the truth of claims that Covid-19 was manmade. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, researchers strongly refuted the idea that the code had been purposefully manipulated. Whereas the article in Nature Medicine was written by senior virologists, one author, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, has already withdrawn his name from the paper cited by Dearlove – while scientists from the Francis Crick institute and Imperial College London also dismissed its conclusions.And the claim in the earlier version of this paper to have proven “beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered” was removed in the later version. This claim relied on an insertion in the genetic code for the spike protein of the virus, the place where the virus locks into our own cells. But the discovery of another novel bat coronavirus in southern China, very closely related to Sars-CoV-2, that includes a similar insertion shows this can evolve naturally.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, this sort of logic will not deter conspiracy theorists. The dark power of the internet means that anyone, anywhere, can find evidence to echo even the most outlandish of claims. Theories that Sars originated from space or that HIV was manmade are readily available, but it doesn’t make them true. Such conspiracies play to our most base instincts and paranoias – fears that dissolve logic and reason. The details of how this virus emerged naturally are far less exciting. They’re about how humans and animals have interacted for millennia, now at an unprecedented rate. They’re about how human domination of the world’s ecosystems as we encroach on animal habitats is opening new pathways for viruses, once hidden in the depths of the forest, to be transmitted to humans.Even as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, analysing its origin is of critical importance for our species on this planet. If we allow myths and rumours to set our pandemic prevention agenda, we miss, quite literally, the forest for the trees. We estimate that there are 1.7m undiscovered viruses in wildlife in emerging disease hotspots such as rural southeast Asia. Rather than chasing conspiracies, we should be focusing our efforts on these regions and the communities on their frontlines. A pandemic such as this one isn’t a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy. Ignoring the guidance of the global scientific community about how and why they emerge will come at a great cost to us all.• Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a4c7d25ae9b3df18c6f2840d08e15d5ca1110c8/0_56_4900_2943/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17bbc9b4f5a300ebbd4a48244cfc5b62","title":"its time for britain to think seriously about reparations for slavery","story":"The Caribbean island where my ancestors were forced to work still bears the scars of slavery - they should be recognisedThe fall of Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol on Sunday has quickly become the defining image of the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests across Britain. These protests were initially prompted by the killing of George Floyd in the US and systemic racism everywhere, but they may finally force us into a thorough examination of the British empire and its role in slavery.Born in Bristol in 1636, Colston was the preeminent slave trader of his day, and during the time of his involvement with the Royal African Company – between 1680 to 1692 – it is estimated that the company transported some 84,000 Africans to the Caribbean and the Americas, of whom 19,000 died on the way.In the decades that followed Colston’s death in 1721, another slave merchant rose to notoriety in Bristol: Samuel Span. Span headed the influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which had once petitioned parliament to lift the monopoly granted to the Royal African Company over the slave trade so that it could join it.Span resonates on a personal level, because not only did he own the Caribbean island to which my African forebears were brought to work as slaves, he himself was also my ancestor.Those clamouring for change must also make demands on behalf of those – in the Caribbean and beyond – who have been hard-hit by men like Colston and Span. They must begin to speak of reparations.In 1763, at the conclusion of the seven years’ war, France ceded to Britain the islands of St Vincent and the Grenadines, which included tiny Union Island, where my family have lived for generations. Span, then a naval chief, was rewarded with the island, giving him absolute control over its slaves. He set about transporting more Africans on Bristol-crewed vessels to work on the island’s cotton plantations. The island’s slave population reached a peak of 635 in 1822. Span named the island’s two main settlements after places in Bristol: Clifton and Ashton. Today, my late grandmother’s home faces the sea in Ashton, Union Island.When Span died in 1796, his vast fortune – which includes Union Island, and ran into the millions of pounds in today’s money – was left to his English children. Other descendants who worked to create the family’s wealth would not see a single penny.In the early 2000s I moved to Clifton, Bristol, for my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol, which was founded with money derived from the sale of tobacco produced on plantations in the American south that once held slaves.That the university had failed to address the racism and elitism upon which it was founded seemed glaringly obvious. There were only a handful of black students. And over the three years I spent there, I did not see a single black academic. Last year the student union called on the university to commission an independent review into “institutionalised racism” after a slew of incidents.Racism still appears to loom large in Bristol’s recent history, too. It is worth remembering that the city’s African-Caribbean community, inspired by Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama, led a boycott of the local bus service in 1963, protesting against widespread racial discrimination in employment and housing.The boycott is considered to have been an influence on the passing of the landmark Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968, which outlawed racial discrimination in employment and housing – a reminder that direct action has brought about change. Failure to tackle poor housing and the over-policing of black communities were among the factors that led to riots in April 1980 in St Paul’s, an inner-city neighbourhood with historic importance for the African-Caribbean community (now the area is undergoing rapid gentrification). Today, Colston’s toppling and subsequent drowning in the waters of Bristol’s harbour, where his slave ships once docked, should force the city – and the country as a whole – into a wider reckoning about racism and empire.In fact, the process has already begun: last year the University of Bristol appointed Olivette Otele as professor of the history of slavery, with a mandate to investigate the institution’s and the city’s links to the trade.But what about Union Island?Unionites continued to live in poverty long after slaves were freed in 1838. The island had to wait until the 1980s to gain access to electricity, just after St Vincent and the Grenadines won its independence from Britain. Labelled the Tahiti of the Caribbean, because of its lush volcanic silhouette set in sparkling coral-laden seas, Union attracts an international cast of wealthy jetsetters – even though its 3,000 or so permanent residents find themselves grinding through a third year of recession. Unemployment and poverty are rife. Statues in tribute to the likes of Colston and Span in British cities rightly seem abhorrent to many. But the material damage they wrought was felt far beyond these shores – it is high time that the damage is fully accounted for.We in the UK need to begin a national debate on reparations for slavery, a crime which heralded the age of capitalism and provided the basis for racism that continues to endanger black life globally. It will follow a landmark US Congress hearing on the topic last year.Protesters making demands of British institutions and examining the iniduals who profited from slavery, must also follow the money trail to places such as Union Island. Our vision for change must be global because Britain, after all, was a vast empire.• Amandla Thomas-Johnson is a freelance foreign correspondent based in Dakar, Senegal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18fd609aae988e476a65612c97fb0ac3204379f/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbfd576b8935da236f0114d1d62decac","title":"reopening schools what is happening in england","story":"The government has scrapped plans for all primary school pupils to return before summerThe government has done a U-turn. It began a phased reopening of schools in England last week, with primary schools opening to children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June, after all schools were closed from 23 March to curb the spread of coronavirus. Boris Johnson’s goal, however, was that all primary school children in England should be back in class for a month before the summer holiday.On Tuesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September. It is a serious blow for the the government’s strategy to bring the country out of lockdown, but an even greater blow for children – particularly disadvantaged pupils – who are losing out on months of their education because of Covid-19 restrictions.Headteachers and teaching unions had been telling the government for weeks that the reopening plan was unworkable because of physical distancing requirements, space constraints and staff shortages. On Tuesday, the government had to admit they were right.The government’s own guidance says schools should teach pupils in protective bubbles of no more than 15, half the normal class size, to limit risk of transmission of the virus. The maths is simple enough for a primary school child – if the usual classes of 30 are halved, a school will need double the number of classrooms and not even the most energetic and ingenious of headteachers can manage that.Ministers are going to leave it to the experts. Williamson has said he would like schools that have the capacity to welcome back more children before the summer break, but headteachers will be given the flexibility to decide for themselves if and when to admit more pupils. Schools in England come in all shapes and sizes – some are old Victorian buildings with small classrooms and limited outdoor space, while others can be adapted more easily to cater for multiple groups of smaller classes.Secondary schools in England, like primary schools, will remain open to children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, and students preparing to take GCSEs and A-levels next summer will – ideally – get some face-to-face time with their teachers. Otherwise, most secondary school pupils will continue with online lessons until the end of term.Williamson told MPs the government was “working to bring all children back to school in September”. He also said exams would take place as normal next summer. Teachers are more circumspect and warn that if physical distancing is still required by the end of the summer, schools may have to offer a combination of online lessons and face-to-face teaching, limiting the number of pupils on site at any one time.Education is a devolved issue. Wales has waited to reopen its schools until 29 June, but will only allow a third of pupils on site at any school and only for a limited period. The summer term will be extended for a week to help pupils adapt, and the Welsh government has said some remote learning will continue next term.In Scotland, the majority of pupils will not return until 11 August, after their summer holiday, and they will receive a blended model of in-school and at-home learning. In Northern Ireland, some pupils will return in late August with a phased return for the rest after that.Ministers are under growing pressure to spell out plans to help disadvantaged children catch up on lost learning. While they have been entitled to attend school throughout the closures, many have not and formal teaching has been suspended. There are fears the attainment gap will widen and disadvantaged children who have not been able to access online resources from home will fall further behind. There have been calls for summer camps, but planning appears to be at an early stage and the education secretary has acknowledged it will take more than a few weeks to help close the gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4156113e7297bdaa118bfb8bc43ccde17dd1779/854_212_2482_1489/master/2482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e98c86c25dc9da4df5a728cea8ad542","title":"birdwatch the hobby a spectacular flypast from ferrari of the skies","story":"Falcon, built for agility and rapid response, can pursue insects in flightSometimes, a bird doesn’t just appear in your field of view, but forces itself instantly into your consciousness.

At 24, not only is she one of the oldest grizzlies living outside a zoo, she has also continued having cubs to a venerable age, becoming a poster child for the recovery of bears in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.And no grizzly has done more, through her own behavior, to change a perception that members of her species are temperamental menaces ready to attack people at the slightest provocation.In mid-May, the 350lb grand dame emerged in Grand Teton national park, striding alongside Pilgrim Creek. Trailing close behind the matriarch were four cubs, born this winter in a wilderness den high in the snowy backcountry.\u0026nbspMangelsen has been chronicling the life and times of 399 for nearly 15 years.\u0026nbspGoodall counts herself among the bear’s most ardent admirers, and, holed up in England, was eagerly awaiting word on whether 399 had survived the long winter.\u0026nbspMangelsen said she was ecstatic.The population of grizzlies in the Yellowstone region was given protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 after their numbers dipped to less than 150, and scientists feared they could disappear altogether. But their recovery, thanks to habitat protection, crackdowns on poaching and a ban on hunting, is considered one of the greatest conservation triumphs in US history.\u0026nbspToday, at least\u0026nbsp700 grizzlies inhabit the region and, luring tourists, they have paid tangible economic idends.Born in 1996, 399 has demonstrated the importance of a healthy female bear to an overall population. At least 22 bears are descended from her, both cubs and cubs of cubs (in human terms, grandchildren).\u0026nbspIt’s possible she could become a great grandmother – a senior citizen who is still having offspring of her own.Generally pacific in nature, 399 has raised her broods by roadsides in view of groups of curious humans, including some who have exercised poor judgment by moving closer to take photographs of her and her cubs. She has, with one exception, demonstrated incredible restraint.In 2007, she mauled a Wyoming schoolteacher after he strolled by a spot where 399 and three cubs were feeding on an elk carcass in the bushes.\u0026nbspThe teacher survived, and the park superintendent determined that the mother was only behaving naturally, acting in defense of the cubs and their meal.Yet researchers note that it’s not easy being a young grizzly, even with a keen parent like 399.\u0026nbspAbout\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof those in 399’s bloodline have died. One was shot by a big-game hunter, another was killed for preying upon cattle, and a few have been struck by cars.\u0026nbspThe drama has played out in front of legions of human onlookers who, in turn, have circulated details on social media as if 399 were the star of a soap opera.The oldest grizzly in the Yellowstone region documented with cubs was 27. Mangelsen had a hunch that 399 would emerge this year with more of her own. During the summer of 2019 she was seen in the company of a regular suitor, a huge 600lb male nicknamed Bruno who is believed to have sired some of 399’s earlier infants. Mangelsen and other observers were not disappointed.“Four-cub litters are rare,” said Frank van Manen, a senior research biologist who oversees the Yellowstone region’s\u0026nbspGrizzly Bear Study Team. “We have documented females producing cubs well into their early- to mid- 20s, but a litter of four at that age is definitely unique.”Most visitors come to Yellowstone hoping to catch a glimpse of bears. \u0026nbspThere is a heated public debate about whether sport hunting of bears should again be allowed in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, where the Greater Yellowstone population lives. That question, along with the possible removal of endangered species protections, is tied up in the courts.To manage the throngs of bear watchers, Grand Teton national park, next door to Yellowstone, has\u0026nbspmobilized its “bear brigade”. Apart from trying to keep safe distances between bears and tourists, it has an added coronavirus-era task of doing the same between people. Last week, it was not uncommon to see people trading information about the whereabouts of 399 through open car windows.For Steve Franklin, a retired firefighter and arson investigator from Phoenix, 399 possesses a particular mystique. Franklin told the  that he had just made his own contribution to the lore of this celebrity bear, having spotted her before anyone else.“I dreamed of being the person who sees her first in the spring and gets the photo,” Franklin said. “Everyone who knows the legacy of 399 wants to be that person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178afdc6aaac8c768787d1ba6bf4221371f8b65f/0_0_4515_2709/master/4515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc712039da8b26a3634e3199cd828bc7","title":"chris packham the virus has taught us that we are part of nature not above it","story":"The naturalist has always spoken his mind – and attracted death threats in the process. But Covid-19 has given him a new perspective on how humans can live in harmony with the natural world ‘I’m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,” Chris Packham tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. “One of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it’s almost blinding.” The naturalist’s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can’t.Generally, of course, you can see it: Springwatch has been back on screens, packed with the images – baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking – we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the “national treasure” class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not – he won’t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have brought him death threats of the most lurid kind (dead birds hung up by his gatepost, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).Packham admits the idea is controversial, but “I approach things as a pragmatic biologist”, he says, calmly. “There’s not a racist cell in my body I don’t think of humans as being different.” That was not my question, although he has been accused – nefariously, he says – of singling out countries such as Nigeria, and therefore pointing the finger at sub-Saharan Africa, when “the real problem is what you and I are consuming”. “Ultimately, we are all the same species, in the same place, at the same time, with the same problem, and if we don’t start thinking collectively to sort it out, then we won’t do it,” he says. “A global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen.”\u0026nbspI happen to disagree – if you look at the recent work of the social geographer Danny Dorling, it shows that birth rates are already in decline worldwide we are entering a natural slowdown. What we have not managed to slow down is rich people’s consumption.But, in a way, this makes me admire Packham all the more: there is enough to contest in these choppy waters that he could avoid them altogether and still hold his head high as a passionate defender of the natural world. He does not play it safe, nor does he skirt the largest, most uncomfortable implications of his analysis. He worries constantly – about the IPCC’s warning that we have 10 years to solve the climate crisis, about the strongman politics dominating the world stage, about the loss of bioersity and the long-term impact that will have on harvests – but he does not\u0026nbspsound\u0026nbspworried. He sounds like a man telling you that your boiler is broken, but he knows how to fix it.We need better leaders, given that we are living under “undoubtedly the worst portfolio of politicians that we could possibly have imaged in our lifetime”, and we need to “shape a new world” after the pandemic, with the environment at the centre of our decision-making. On reflection, we all know how to fix this boiler, just as we all enjoy the sight of a ladybird, but it is soothing and exciting to hear it described.Packham always says of his early life, growing up in Hampshire, that he was a bit difficult, emotionally adrift, until he took a baby kestrel from its nest when he was 14 and fell violently in love with it. This led to a zoology degree, at the University of Southampton. He got into TV not via presenting, but in production, for the BBC’s 1984 series The Living Planet. His career as a presenter started with The Really Wild Show, in 1986, when he electrified the nature scene with his Gary Rhodes hair and his apparently effortless fluency.He has an endearing Dr Dolittle quality the defining images of his career capture him cuddling an animal or bird that does not like to be cuddled. Here he is with an owl, now with a badger. He is much more evangelist than showman.\u0026nbsp“I probably got as much joy out of other people reconnecting with nature as I have got from reconnecting with nature myself,” he says of the lockdown period. “It’s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds and birds singing in their gardens, but they will now have to join our ranks and remember what they took from that, because we do have to fight for it.”As the pandemic confined us all to our homes, he and his 25-year-old stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, launched The Self-Isolating Bird Club: half an hour a day of guerrilla twitching, broadcast on Facebook every morning. “People seemed to like it,” he says (7.8 million of them tuned in). He and McCubbin have since taken their double act to Springwatch. “The producers of Springwatch liked our on-screen rapport. I call it bickering, they call it on-screen rapport.”\u0026nbspHe is keen to stress that McCubbin is a good, sound zoologist in her own right: “She knows her stuff, she likes science and understanding things. She loves finding out things that I don’t know and she does that very easily.” You would struggle to say who is the straight man of the double act – they are both incredibly, winningly geeky.McCubbin is the daughter of Packham’s ex-partner, Jo McCubbin. They split up years ago, but Packham remained a large and influential part of her life – she came to zoology partly thanks to time she spent at the Isle of Wight zoo run by Packham’s partner, Charlotte Corney. He describes these relationships as “a relatively confused – but not too unusual, these days – family setup.” They all get on very well. “Charlotte goes to Jo’s parties I don’t. I’m not a party sort of person.” (I am reminded of the joke about the doctor, the lawyer and the mathematician who are each asked whether it is better to have a wife or a mistress. The doctor says it is better for your health to be married. The lawyer says it is better for your finances to be unmarried. The mathematician says: “It is better to have a wife\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspa mistress – then they can chat and you can go off and do maths.”)He is relatively equanimous about the restrictions of the pandemic, as you might imagine of a person who does not like parties. But he is deadly serious about Covid-19. “Speaking entirely biologically, what the whole, horribly harsh, tragic lesson of the virus has taught us is that we are part of nature we’re not there to hold dominion over it, we’re not above it.“We’ve always been exposed to pathogens – everything from smallpox to bubonic plague. We’ve beaten them through our advances in science and I’m not regretting that. But we are an organism, living on a planet, and the way we were living was unsustainable. We were overcrowded, we were eating animals that we’d shipped alive from one part of the world to another, and we’re paying a terrible price for it.”This is not a million miles away from the putative Extinction Rebellion (XR) stickers, disavowed by the group as fake, that read “Corona is the cure, humans are the virus”. But he reiterates that he is not against medical advances he is very much in favour of people living long and healthy lives. Nevertheless, he does not situate the plight of mankind at the centre of his thinking we are no more than one part of an infinitely precious ecosystem – and we are the part causing the problems.This is the kernel of his radicalism – and no broadcaster’s duty of impartiality will make him disavow it, nor his support for XR and similar movements. “That’s the most positive thing that we’ve seen – Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future. All those young people have taken to the streets, in an informed way and in a peaceful way. That’s been absolutely heartening. That gives me a sense of hope.“And again, in the last week, we’ve seen all of these demonstrations because of continued racism. Some of them have been violent. I never support violence, but a lot of people are very, very angry. When people reach that tipping point, they no longer sit in bars they take to the streets and demand their rights. We need to be demanding a right to a healthy environment and I think we’ve started to do that.” (I spoke to Packham before the Bristol protest at which the statue of Edward Colston was torn down, so this should not be taken as a comment on that, but my impression is that his heart is with the angry protesters, rather than those bemoaning the civil unrest.)\u0026nbspIn his sentiment and his delivery – quietly passionate, unabashed by what is and is not considered acceptable – Packham is very like Greta Thunberg, who often says that she thinks her Asperger’s is part of what makes her the activist she is. She is not affected by convention or “the Overton window” (the range of policies deemed politically acceptable by the mainstream), but rather tells the truth as she sees it.Packham was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2005 and has spoken openly about it since, although he does not describe it in terms of upsides. “I struggled terribly when I was younger. Not as a young child, but later, when I was an adolescent and going in to my 20s. And my hope in speaking about it openly was that young people wouldn’t suffer in the same way. Because if they had a better understanding, and the people around them had a better understanding, life would be a lot easier. And it’s been quite heart-rending more people come up to me and talk about autism than do about natural history.”His job, though, is the same in both cases – to explain things, he says, in relatively simple ways. “I don’t mean that in a patronising way. I just mean speaking frankly and plainly.”\u0026nbspThe last time I interviewed Packham was five years ago. Back then, while powerfully exercised about animal cruelty, he was much more comfortable on the territory of other species, patiently explaining why he preferred birds to mammals (“I like feathers better than fur I think eggs are neater than placental matter I like things that fly rather than things that walk and – this is a subjective thing – they’re a more beautiful organism”). But the geopolitical intensity of the world we are in now draws him back constantly to our species. “Let’s be honest: a lot of the governments that have mishandled the corona crisis are not going to survive it. I sincerely hope that there will be a huge peaceful shake-up and people will start moving in the right direction.”While he is careful about which governments he means, he is resolute about the right direction: away from fossil fuels and flying away from careless consumption away from considering the natural world a resource to exploit. We are good at solutions, but only under pressure. “One of the stats that I’m always drawn to is that, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, in 1941, 7 December, America was producing 4m cars a year. From that point until the end of the war, they only produced 141. That’s how powerful our ability to respond to problems is. They used that capacity to produce weapons.”I am surprised by the parable – it does not feel like humanity at its finest, that, when push comes to shove, we will throw everything we have at killing each other better. But he is not a sentimentalist – whether or not we are capable of great change, we are certainly capable of huge change – and that is what the world needs. I thought I detected a note of optimism, but he had returned to his house and was eating toast, so it may have been blood sugar.\u0026nbspSpringwatch is on BBC Two at 8pm every night until Friday previous episodes from this season are available to stream on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d343c1bb4d37155065b0bef614d25b47e6bcfae0/0_401_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c77d448fa86782058410699c5ba6fc9","title":"spiky hairy shiny la abuzz with new insect discoveries in pictures aoe","story":"Since 2014, entomologists have sampled millions of insects around the city, identifying 800 species, including 47 new to science.

No one was interested in the story, in which the unemployed bachelor ends up running around after a cohort of old ladies whose spirit and vigour remain undimmed despite various ailments. Everyone thought he was crazy: who would be interested in a funny film about four old women and a middle-aged bloke?Then, after a life working in the theatre and as an assistant director, Di Gregorio co-wrote the celebrated mafia drama, Gomorrah, with Matteo Garrone, and his fortune changed. Garrone encouraged him to resurrect his earlier film idea and offered to produce while Di Gregorio starred and directed. Mid-August Lunch – a gorgeous, unsentimental comedy in which the collective naughtiness of the old ladies entertains more with each viewing – went on to win the debut director prize at the Venice film festival in 2008 and became an Italian arthouse hit.\u0026nbspTwo more films starring “Gianni” followed: The Salt of Life, the celebrated sequel to Mid-August Lunch, in which Gianni’s 96-year-old on-screen mother plays poker with her friends while her son laments his increasing invisibility to women (without, thank God, ever being lascivious) and the lesser known Good for Nothing, in which Gianni is a put-upon civil servant who has to learn to say no. And now there is Citizens of the World, a tender comedy in which yet another version of Gianni – this time a retired Latin professor – plots with two other pensioners to move to a country where their state pensions will go further. Until, that is, a young African migrant makes them rethink their plans.\u0026nbspWhen I first met Di Gregorio in 2011, he took me on a tour of Rome in his 40-year-old Fiat 500, rolling cigarettes as the car bumped over the cobbles around the Colosseum and laughing about the fact that Mid-August Lunch could never have been made with old men because “they would have spent the entire film crying and being hypochondriacs! The men you see sitting in the bar in The Salt of Life won’t even go to the cinema to see the film they’re in, whereas the women in Mid-August Lunch were planning trips to Venice.”And yet, during the decade that followed The Salt of Life, he changed his mind and made Citizens of the World. Why? Di Gregorio, now 71, is talking on the phone from the large flat in Rome in which he has lived with his wife and two daughters since his mother’s death I am immediately reminded of his warmth, humility and throaty laugh. “I will tell you why! Matteo Garrone called me and said, ‘You are the specialist when it comes to making films about old guys. You have to make a film about a group of male pensioners with very small pensions.’ It was such a simple but brilliant idea. There aren’t enough portrayals of adventurous pensioners on screen, nor explorations of friendship between men.”\u0026nbspThe various versions of Gianni that Di Gregorio plays in his films allow the director to explore different stages of his life and, as he ages, he is finding himself more like the women planning trips to Venice than the lazy men in the bar. “The older I get, the fewer fears I have. Nowadays 70 is young! There is still so much to do, so much to explore.”In 2011, Di Gregorio told me that he searches for the comedy in life because he is melancholic by nature he is also very good at using irony to explore ageing, in a similar way to Larry David. Might he even be the Italian Larry David? He laughs. “Grazie! Grazie! I am truly flattered by that comparison. Seeing yourself with irony is particularly important when you’re in your 70s.”\u0026nbspLike David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Di Gregorio’s work is about nothing and everything. There is always the portrayal of the everyday in Italy – a glass of white on the pavement outside a bar, a thin slice of pizza a taglio – but, in Citizens of the World, there is also open criticism of the Italian government’s shameful handling of migrants. “While I was writing about the escapades of three pensioners, there were stories on the news every day of migrants arriving in Italy on dinghies or of boats overturning and migrants drowning. I got the idea of a young African guy, Abu, hanging around with the three pensioners because I wanted to explore the notions of acceptance, of tolerance, of welcoming people to our country.”He sighs. “The Italian government has imposed some very harsh laws against migrants and no one seems to know what to do. It also becomes clear in the film that Abu is the one who needs to travel the most, not the three old Romans. Something incredible happened after we finished the film: Salih Saadin Khalid, who plays Abu, is a real migrant and he used the money we paid him to leave Italy and join his family in Canada! It gave us so much joy.”Italy is slowly easing out of lockdown and, after an initial period of “blackout” during which he couldn’t read, write or even watch a movie, Di Gregorio is now desperate to start shooting his next film and to enjoy a glass of wine at his local bar. “Food and wine are in our DNA. Italians always manage to eat well during a crisis, even if they don’t have much money. It’s a consolation.”And, once the pandemic is over, might Di Gregorio consider escaping from Italy like his on-screen alter ego? He laughs, both thrilled and appalled at the idea. “I haven’t managed to yet! I still live in the apartment that my mother once lived in. I don’t have to travel far to make my films. I am completely rooted here in Rome, like an ancient tree.”\u0026nbsp• Citizens of the World is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 12 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb8223d1d9bf00ba839344fe63de0add9885331/0_119_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c510537a60f8913f090123c481cbdc4","title":"how often have clubmates faced each other in the world cup final","story":"Plus: Friday night fixture stalwarts, Half-Man Half-Biscuit and rapid five-goal salvos“How often have clubmates faced each other in the World Cup final?” asks Mukhtar Khan.Here’s Ben Cordes with an impressively thorough response. “The first domestic teammates to play on opposite sides in a World Cup final were Stuttgart’s José Basualdo (Argentina) and Guido Buchwald (West Germany) in 1990. The 1998 final between France and Brazil was the first instance with multiple examples: Ronaldo and Youri Djorkaeff (Internazionale), Leonardo and Marcel Desailly (Milan) plus Roberto Carlos and Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid).“In 2006, Juventus contributed eight players to the line-ups, the most ever from a single club. They were: Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro del Piero, Mauro Camoranesi, Gianluca Zambrotta (Italy) and Patrick Viera, Lilian Thuram, David Trezeguet\u0026nbsp(France). Netherlands v Spain in 2010 saw the first Premier League clubmates facing off. Liverpool’s Dirk Kuyt and Fernando Torres, as well as Arsenal’s Robin van Persie and Spanish substitute Cesc Fàbregas. In 2014, Lazio’s Miroslav Klose (Germany) prevailed over club colleague Lucas Biglia (Argentina).”Perhaps it’s no surprise that this is becoming a more regular occurrence. As Ben points out, in 2018 there were three Spanish clubs involved as France played Croatia: Atlético Madrid (Antoine Griezmann, Lucas Hernández, Sime Vrsaljko), Real Madrid (Raphaël Varane, Luka Modric) and Barcelona (Samuel Umtiti, Ivan Rakitic).Mike Meehall-Wood has more examples, including 2010, where extra-time substitute Rafael van der Vaart came on to face Real Madrid teammates Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos (Xabi Alonso started the game but had already been substituted). Mike also offers an example from 2002, when Brazil defender Lucio took on Leverkusen teammates Carsten Ramelow, Bernd Schneider and Oliver Neuville, six weeks after playing alongside them in the Champions League final. Lucio was on the winning side in Yokohoma, as Brazil beat Germany 2-0.Japan defender Aya Sameshima won the 2011 Women’s World Cup during a brief stint at Boston Breakers, defeating clubmates Rachel Beuhler, Lauren Cheney and Amy LePelbeit in the final against USA. And in 2007, Martina Müller came off the bench for Germany while her Wolfsburg colleague, Cristiane, was on the field for Brazil.“My hometown club, Southend United, used to play a very large number of home games on a Friday night. The reason, I was told, is that attendance really suffered on Saturdays when West Ham (an hour’s train to Upton Park, back in the day) were also at home. This got me wondering, which team in the top four isions of English football has played most games on a Friday night?” asks Dean Collins.“I couldn’t give an exact figure, but from the 1960s onwards, due to their geographical proximity to both Liverpool and Everton, a lot of Tranmere Rovers’ home fixtures were played on a Friday,” writes Matt McCann. “They played the night before to try and attract fans of those clubs and I’m guessing they would have played more Friday night games than anyone else in the league.“This springs to mind chiefly because of a (probably apocryphal) story about the legendary troubadours Half Man Half Biscuit. Sometime in the early 1980s, the band were asked to appear live on Channel 4’s the Tube but, as the show went out at 6pm on Friday the band, who were staunch Rovers fans, declined the invitation as it would clash with the home game against Scunthorpe on the same night.Meanwhile, John Tumbridge has written in to point out that the reason he was given for Southend playing on Fridays was that “in the 80s when I worked nearby, I was told it was to avoid clashing with the Saturday market”. Other teams have experimented with Friday night football but they haven’t stuck with it for long. Scarborough tried it in 1990 but pulled in only 625 fans against Wrexham, the fourth tier’s lowest ever attendance.“Glynn Marshall points out that Leicester were 4-0 up on the 15-minute mark and that this is the fastest a Premier League team has been 4-0 up,” writes Miles Macklin. “However, Bernardo Silva put Manchester City 4-0 up after 15 minutes in the 8-0 win over Watford earlier this year, so I wondered if you could confirm the exact timings of these goals.”We haven’t been able to confirm the exact minutes and seconds for these goals but Opta did not flag the 4-0 lead as being faster than that of Leicester’s in 1998. They did, however, confirm that the fifth goal, scored by Nicolás Otamendi\u0026nbspin the 18th minute, sealed the Premier League record for the quickest team to lead 5-0.“Noticing Stephen Shepherd’s story last week about half of Gillingham’s side not making the Orient game due to traffic, are there any other infamous cases of a side not arriving on time for the game?”\u0026nbspasked Kevin Meadowcroft in October 2011.Here’s one answer from Rob Davies: “This story does not concern a team but rather an inidual, Ishmael Demontagnac, who during the festive programme of 2005-06 stayed in bed for Walsall’s trip to Bristol City on 2 January 2006, instead of getting the team bus. Apparently he thought there was no game that day and that it was his day off. Walsall lost 3- 0.”“Has anyone waited longer between scoring on their debut and their second goal than Charlton Athletic’s Peter Reeves?” asks Marlon Seton.“Seeing as we would have reached the point of some teams having nothing to play for. It got me thinking.

The company is understood to be seeking to cut just over half of those staff involved in the consultation.The company, which was sold to private equity group Exponent two years ago for £166m, has a portfolio of titles mainly in the technology, fitness and cycling sectors. Brands range from Cyclist and Expert Reviews to Fortean Times and an unofficial guide to global phenomenon Fortnite.“The impact of Covid-19 has been significant for the publishing sector,” said a spokesman for the company.\u0026nbsp“As a result, this week we will begin a redundancy consultation process here in the UK. We are fully committed to supporting employees in impacted groups throughout this period and ensuring that this process is fair and transparent.”The publisher, which once owned Maxim before shutting the lads’ magazine more than a decade ago, said that it has been forced to make redundancies as cost savings measures had not proved to be enough to weather the impact of the pandemic.“Although we are confident that Dennis has a bright future, we have not been immune to its economic impact,” said the spokesman. “We have worked hard to reduce our costs and found savings in several areas however, the outlook for our advertising, events and retail businesses, which accounts for approximately a third of the group’s revenues, has deteriorated due to the pandemic. Other revenue areas of the business have been mostly unaffected.”The company also employs 133 staff in the US who are understood not to be affected by the job cuts at this stage.With the nation on lockdown and advertisers pulling budgets as businesses grind to a halt, magazine and newspaper publishers have been financially hammered. Enders Analysis estimates that UK magazine publishers will lose £200m in advertising spend and £52m in copy sales due to the impact of the coronavirus.Last month, Bauer Media, one of the UK’s biggest magazine publishers, said that it was considering closing, selling, merging or shutting the print edition of 10 titles including music bible Q as the coronavirus crisis hastens the shift of readers and advertisers online.Chris Duncan, the former News UK executive who runs UK publishing at Bauer Media, said that a number of the 100 titles it publishes “are not expected to be sustainable after the crisis”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2037774804774e6a1feb1a52bf3c9e59602bc553/0_186_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397613b0e3a3f45e2bc7b0a465dc1d12","title":"forget burnout there is nothing worse than a boring job","story":"Being severely underworked can bring depression, illness and – for one French employee – a tasty payoutAge: As old as employment, but the term itself was coined in 2007 by two Swiss business consultants, Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin.I guess somebody has been working too hard. To be honest, I’m hardly working.\u0026nbspSounds like my dream job! Be careful what you wish for. You may end up suffering from boreout.\u0026nbspIs that like burnout? It’s similar, but with a very different cause. It turns out that being severely underworked can also lead to depression, illness and, in some cases, a huge payout for damages.\u0026nbspThis is so not a thing.\u0026nbspIt so is. A Paris appeals court just upheld a boreout claim by a former Interparfums employee, Frederic Desnard, awarding him €40,000 (£36,000).\u0026nbspPlease state the facts of the case.\u0026nbspOnce a busy and fulfilled worker, Desnard was sidelined after the company lost a big contract in 2010. He was then transferred to a post where “no one cared if I arrived at 9am or 10am”.I do wish they would advertise these jobs more widely. Desnard’s duties were almost nonexistent. “I had to buy some supplies – a few sheets of paper – and then my day was over,” he said.\u0026nbspSeriously, just get me to the interview stage, and I will nail this. The lack of work soon took a psychological toll. “You go on the internet at first,” said Desnard, “and then you shut yourself in an empty office and you cry.”That just sounds like work to me.\u0026nbspDesnard became depressed and had an epileptic fit at the wheel of his car. He took seven months off work and was sacked in 2014, on the grounds that his prolonged absence disrupted the smooth running of the company.\u0026nbspThey couldn’t run the company without someone who didn’t do anything? His lawyer made the same point.\u0026nbspWould it be prejudiced of me to describe the whole notion of boreout as very French? Perhaps not. Under French labour laws it is difficult to make employees redundant. Instead, they are often sidelined or shelved – mis à l’écart – in the hope they will get bored and quit.\u0026nbspI don’t know which is more French – getting paid to do nothing or complaining about it.\u0026nbspDesnard argued it was a form of psychological harassment.\u0026nbspI would describe it as a modest promotion, myself.\u0026nbspUnfortunately for you, the court agreed with Desnard.\u0026nbspDo say: “It is important that companies ensure their employees are neither overworked nor underworked.”Don’t say: “What’s the name of the illness you get when your job is too interesting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bdb65e0053fde0e522ba1ae4f8414d40451908d/0_1199_3280_1966/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00e16264d771081db5fd43bc07a805ea","title":"its hard to find a fix for my faulty folding bicycle","story":"I was inspired to buy a Brompton by its Wheels for Heroes campaign, but now no one will take responsibility for repairing itI’m an NHS worker who was inspired to buy a Brompton bike after using one through its Wheels for Heroes campaign during lockdown. I purchased it online through Cycle Republic, which is owned by Halfords. Within the first week the connecting chain to the gear hub fell off while I was cycling to work. I contacted Cycle Republic which did not respond. I contacted Brompton directly and it promptly arranged for a local dealer to replace the part. Within three weeks, the gear shifter broke and the bolts fell off the rear mudguard.I have spent every day since talking with Cycle Republic, Halfords and Brompton.\u0026nbspCycle Republic stores were closed in April by Halfords and its customer service team stopped replying after a single response. Halfords tells me the bike is not its responsibility as it was purchased from Cycle Republic, despite the fact that all the packaging and paperwork bears the Halfords name.Brompton tells me it is not responsible as it was purchased from Cycle Republic.\u0026nbspIt has offered to arrange for a local dealer to look at the bike but at my expense, although there is a manufacturer’s warranty.I spent £1,200 on an unusable bike that I need for my job working with vulnerable patients in the community.DB, LondonYour email arrived three weeks after another distress call from a Cycle Republic customer whose £345 bike did not materialise. EM of Farnham, Surrey reported that the company was uncontactable, while continuing to trade online.Halfords closed all of its Cycle Republic shops in March after announcing it was esting itself of its performance cycling business and seeking buyers for the outlets. “It is unclear who is the current owner and therefore responsible for its operations right now,” she wrote. “It is unclear whether there are any staff still working for the company and unclear what customers should do once they have essentially handed over their money with no idea if Cycle Republic will honour the contract they have entered into.”When I contacted Halfords, it confirmed that Cycle Republic was still open for business and cancelled and refunded EM’s order. Unprecedented demand for bicycles during lockdown had overwhelmed its helplines, it explains, and it had recruited more staff to contact frustrated customers.Not much appears to have changed, however. Almost all the reviews on Trustpilot since lockdown report lack of delivery, response or redress for faulty items. Under consumer law it is the retailer, not the manufacturer, who is liable for problems with a purchase, so Brompton was justified in referring you to Cycle Republic.When I went back to Halfords’ press office about your sorry saga, it set about getting your bike repaired and refunded the price you paid, so you will end up with free wheels. “We have apologised and will take steps to ensure that other customers don’t have the same experience,” it says. “We can confirm all Cycle Republic guarantees and servicing commitments will continue to be honoured through our Halfords shops.”Brompton says: “We are working with the Halfords group to review its home delivery and servicing processes to ensure they meet our quality standards. We were contacted by the customer on 27 May and have been in regular communication with him and Cycle Republic since, to resolve the situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05b625877df0b11425e57b658ce7c44a38d23b5/0_356_4664_2797/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b11e5e17fef90487662d08516a53b32","title":"living in england are you planning to move out of a city","story":"We would like to hear from people who are relocating outside cities due to the coronavirus pandemicWith estate agents in England allowed to conduct viewings via video or appointments where people are physical distancing, some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid a rise in home working.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving away from an urban area we want to hear from you.What are your reasons for moving out of the city?

She concluded in her report that the government’s response to extremism was “inadequate”, “unfocused” and urgently needed a complete overhaul.The review called on the government to focus on what the commission calls “hateful extremism”, which stands apart from terrorism and violent extremism.As part of his legal review, Rowley has been tasked to identify whether there are gaps in existing legislation or inconsistencies in enforcing the law in relation to hateful\u0026nbspextremism\u0026nbspand make recommendations that are compatible with existing legal and human rights obligations.Khan said the UK authorities “ability to counter repeat and persistent offenders is inconsistent and often ineffective”.\u0026nbsp“When\u0026nbspextremists\u0026nbspengage in terrorist activity, they are often caught by robust counter-terrorism legislation.\u0026nbspBut when they incite hatred, engage in persistent hatred or justify violence against others,\u0026nbspextremists\u0026nbspknow they will not cross over into the threshold of terrorism.”\u0026nbspKhan said a legal review was “even more pertinent” during the current pandemic as\u0026nbspextremists\u0026nbsppropagate “horrific” material which seeks to blame and incite hatred and violence against other people in society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3293aae03c57694a70233e027ca43363ecebc48f/0_26_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b98f32397c87d3f563b4c53352b7eed","title":"colin kaepernick george floyd roger goodell","story":"Goodell’s reversal means kneeling will become just another patriotic thing to do during the anthem, but the mainstreaming of ideas once dismissed as radical shows protest worksFrom the moment Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the national anthem to call attention to police brutality and systemic racism before a San Francisco 49ers preseason game back in 2016, he stood alone while the meaning of his silent demonstration was hijacked, contorted and undermined by detractors cloaked in patriotism, either misguidedly or deliberately, as a protest against the US military. The most tremendous of these bad actors was, of course, Donald Trump, at an Alabama rally the following year when he infamously challenged the league’s owners to release anyone who refused to stand: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’”\u0026nbspRather than back the players’ right to freedom of expression, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell gifted Trump a decisive optical victory early in his administration by unveiling a policy requiring every player, coach, trainer, ballboy, referee and executive to stand for the anthem or face punishment.\u0026nbspFour years later – after the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer choked the life from George Floyd in a gruesome extrajudicial murder that was beamed into living rooms throughout the country, sending hundred of thousands into the streets across America to demand police reform – Kaepernick’s protest appears not merely justified but prescient. On Thursday, more than a dozen of the NFL’s biggest stars including Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas and Deshaun Watson, the sorts of in-their-prime stars who might have shied away from social issues in the past, posted a video demanding the NFL state that it condemns systemic racism and “admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting”. And congressional legislation tackling police reform that would have been dismissed as politically quixotic only weeks ago has planted itself squarely in the national discourse.Ever since he first seized on Kaepernick’s protest as a fountainhead of easy political points, Trump has co-opted American sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country’s deep ides but the primary theatre. He’s returned to the well time and again when the polling numbers have called for a jolt, but the events of the past week have shown that the reservoir has run dry.The horrifying deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery have made it so the public can no longer stand by as Kaepernick’s protest is misrepresented: the reality of the long-marginalized scourge of state-sanctioned murder of black and brown people has finally reached a mass audience. Consider New Orleans Saints star Drew Brees, who issued a public apology after he was blasted by teammates and fans for saying he “will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States”.On Friday, only hours after Trump publicly excoriated Brees for backing down on his long-held stance, Goodell surprised many by releasing the mea culpa his players asked for: “We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” he said. “We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.”Goodell may have fumbled the handoff that Kaepernick first gave him in 2016, but he wasn’t going to do it twice. And the commissioner’s tacit endorsement has ensured that taking a knee will become the new locking arms – that is to say, an acceptable and thereby meaningless form of protest. Whenever the next NFL season kicks off, kneeling will become another form of pre-game window dressing: just another patriotic thing to do when the anthem plays.But this mainstreaming of ideas once regarded as radical is proof that Kaepernick’s protest, and the sacrifice of his NFL career that came with it, was worth the price.The NFL’s ersity problem is its decision-making ranks has been exhaustively documented, but football itself is the most integrated sport we have in America. It’s not just for black kids, it’s not just for white kids. You can be fat and play on the line. You can be skinny and play wide receiver. You can be a total non-athlete like Tom Brady and win multiple Super Bowls.\u0026nbspWhich made it somewhat depressing that Brees, a 41-year-old who’s spent more than half of his life around black teammates while becoming a symbol of hope for a city that endured one of the worst racial injustices in American history, continued to push a false narrative in conflating a protest of extreme police brutality with disrespect for the military – especially when he’d been given four years to get up to speed.Yet Brees’ thoughtful response to Trump’s broadside, addressed directly to the president, represents the sort of teachable moment that’s bound to reach an audience beyond Kaepernick’s influence and further the movement toward justice.“Through my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been,” Brees wrote. “We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.“We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial \u0026amp prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation’s history! If not now, then when?“We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.”Or as LeBron James put it, in more economical language: “Do you understand NOW!!??!!??”Kaepernick’s movement has inspired a groundswell of athletes beyond the NFL, in a sharp break from the “Republicans buy sneakers too” indifference of the previous generation, to speak on social issues with a frequency and ardor not seen since the high water mark of athlete activism of the 1960s, when champions such as Muhammad Ali, John Carlos and Tommie Smith put it all on the line for the advance of justice.And like those three champions before him, Kaepernick will be remembered as a hero, whether he plays another down in the NFL or not. That’s because the change he effected has shifted global opinion, even if required a second far more tragic knee to bring it to pass. Now the real work begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae32a3dd4ac8fe129ed80005ea70044658f9cced/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0106b18f40758c4265fccc5891ab5078","title":"repeat attenders musical super fans documentary mark dooley interview","story":"What makes Wicked and Starlight Express so addictive? A new documentary, Repeat Attenders, chronicles the reasons superfans return to see their favouritesYou might guess that the Australian film-maker Mark Dooley likes musical theatre from his production company’s name being a pun on Hello, Dolly!, the 1964 Broadway hit. Hello Dooley has just produced Repeat Attenders, a tremendous documentary about “super fans” of stage musicals who, after really liking a show, begin to follow it religiously – literally so, going once a week and more often during the holidays.Zoomed from Melbourne, Dooley explains that he had the idea in London, over coffee with a friend who was working on the West End production of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. She mentioned iniduals who spent almost as much time at the theatre as the cast. Intrigued, he “asked around the business, and the stories came flooding in”.Interviewees include a man who saw 1,169 of the 5,123 New York performances of Jonathan Larson’s Rent and a British woman who we meet en route to her 977th viewing of Les Misérables in London.For the record, three times is the most that I have ever seen a production of the same musical, the most recent being Dominic Cooke’s Follies and Trevor Nunn’s Fiddler on the Roof. That felt enough for one show a thought that, as Repeat Attenders explores, never occurs to the most determined returners.One reason that the phenomenon involves musicals is that their often very long runs make obsession possible. Were you to become obsessed with a new play at the Royal Court, you would struggle to see it more than a few times before the run ended. “Absolutely,” agrees Dooley. “Though even within musical theatre, it’s only a few productions. There aren’t really Sondheim repeat attenders because the shows don’t run long enough.”Another important factor, though, is that the super fans Dooley meets have had various struggles in their lives, and most of the shows that go on longest –\u0026nbspWicked, Cats, Starlight Express – are about the triumphant validation of the outsider. “From the first time they saw these shows,” the director says, “the super fans made that connection.”\u0026nbspIt would be easy to imagine another film on the same subject that took the attitude, to paraphrase the name of a well-known musical, “Jesus Christ! Superfans!” But Repeat Attenders is generally non-judgmental, leaving audiences to have their own view on the healthiness of the obsession.\u0026nbsp“I thought of having a narrator,” Dooley says, “but I really didn’t want to force an opinion on people. I just wanted to be as observational as possible, using their voices. I was actually very judgy when I started making the film – thinking it was going to be hilarious meeting these freaks – but, spending time with them on and off camera, I came to the conclusion that there are underlying reasons why we do everything, and so that became the story.”\u0026nbspWhile most of the case studies suggest that repeat attending, although it may arise from lack of self-esteem or life structure, isn’t harming anyone, Dooley includes one example where someone did threaten harm – an American man jailed for stalking a Broadway actress after being arrested at her stage door.“It is a really shocking moment in the film,” the director admits. “It’s not typical of repeat attenders, but it can and does happen. It was a difficult decision, because I don’t want people to think badly of this subject. But, making a documentary, it has to be balanced.”All culture is now altered by the context of Covid-19, but the meaning of this film has changed more than most. I found it impossible to watch without thinking about what these people – for whom the apparent indestructibility of Wicked or Les Misérables was a fixed point of their lives – lost when the theatres closed.“Absolutely,” Dooley agrees. “The people who go to these shows as a bit of escapism, or happiness, or self-care, they can’t now get it. Watching it now, post Covid-19, there is a different element to the film. Even seeing people in a theatre is strange!.”There is a sub-group of hit musicals – led by Everybody’s Talking About Jamie and Grey Gardens – that are based on TV documentaries. So Repeat Attenders – the Musical is surely waiting to be added to the group? Dooley’s smile illuminates the Zoom screen. “You know, I was seriously thinking about that today. It has to happen at some point. This subject matter lends itself to a musical so well.”If that happens, I might not want to see it a thousand times, but certainly once and I would happily see the documentary a second time.

Whether riding atop a fire engine, hanging around the barnyard, or filling a school bus for a field trip turned adventure, their limbless, peg-shaped bodies have grown into an icon synonymous with childhood and imagination. How outrageous, then, to contrast these totems of a more innocent time with such decidedly grownup material as boobs, butts, curse words, drugs, alcohol and full-frontal sexual activity!That’s just about the full extent of the comedic subversion on offer in Crossing Swords, a show unabashed and proud of the sophomoric wit starting with its title. In a medieval setting still considered on-trend in a post-Game of Thrones world, diminutive playthings populate a feudal system of kings, queens, knights and peasants rendered with crude stop-motion animation. Their milieu forms another odd angle with their sensibility, which comes from our modern world of music festivals, crotchless underwear and bong usage. Either of these two juxtapositions – a cutesy aesthetic with a profane ethic, and the old-fashioned genre with the newfangled millennial world into which it’s being released – could sustain a 10-episode series if done with sufficient cleverness or creativity. Instead, creators John Harvatine IV and Tom Root half-ass both types of shtick in the hopes that together, they’ll total one entire ass. The writers behind a show this avowedly adolescent should know their gluteal mathematics better than that.An adventure of this magnitude requires a fitting hero, a notion undercut by the meek rule-follower Patrick (voice of Nicholas Hoult, unrecognizable no matter how hard you listen for him). The pilot sends him into the ranks of the king’s squires-in-training, a mission realized first as a cop-show spoof in which the show quickly loses interest. (It’s here that the inept Patrick gets bumped from the captain’s Shit List down to her Shart List, which gives a damningly accurate impression of the level at which this writing operates.) For the most part, being a knight means attending to an unending series of crappy errands for the boobish king, whether that’s kraken disposal or security services at a monarchy-industry retreat that’s actually an orgy. The latter announces a running theme, come to think of it circumstances often reveal themselves to be a shoddily thrown-together pretense to watch various characters grind their pelvises together like it’s a Rankin-Bass-produced porno.Dulled as Crossing Swords may be, it still hazards the occasional stab at something more affecting or meaningful. More narrative forethought has been put into the trials of young Patrick than Harvatine and Root’s previous series, Robot Chicken, which used a similar animation style to lampoon Gen-X pop culture in sketch format. Spending 21 minutes on a single hi-jink allows the pair to break ground on real ideas, even if they don’t dig too deep afterward. Patrick and the King happen upon a utopian society at the top of a beanstalk and summarily ruin everything with their selfishness, a glancing blow against broad-strokes imperialism.For more garbled social politics, one episode revolves around the local princess getting her first period and being branded a witch, a half-hour that gestures toward destigmatization of women’s health while constantly cracking jokes about how gross menstruation is.\u0026nbspThe best bit tracks Patrick’s efforts to help a hoarder yeti (voiced wonderfully by Natasha Lyonne) make the psychological progress needed to declutter, successful in that it takes character more seriously than its limp attempts at timely commentary. The single compelling idea contained herein concerns Patrick’s unfitness for his time, as a meek-hearted person living in an era of solipsism and savagery. His siblings – a pirate, a rogue and a clownscammer – constantly deride him as a ninny for his kindness and softness. But those qualities don’t just come in handy more often than brute force, they also provide him with a healthy skepticism once he’s entered the corridors of power.A smarter show would burrow into the disillusionment as a rookie squire learns his dream is rotten on the inside, but there’s simply no time, what with all the circumcision gags that need to be made. Nothing against dick humor, which can be executed with finesse and ingenuity, like any other of the bluer schools of comedy. It’s just that in this case, the scripts pass pedestrian potty-mouthing off as the quippy intellect needed to get us comfortable at this low height of brow. This posed less of a stumbling block for the recent Disenchantment, another animated series mining laughs from a 21st-century look back at the 11th.There’s a rigor to Matt Groening’s joke-craft and plotting, bred from decades of work on The Simpsons and Futurama, absent from the dashed-off exploits only slightly more cohesive than the sketch collections that got Harvatine and Root their start. Their latest project makes a jape out of its humble production values in comparison to the small-screen blockbusters that inspire it, and yet more than they realize, it barely holds together as TV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee08f95ea4d9dd2aefe898e80520114f1ecdc1dc/107_0_2666_1601/master/2666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=184e8230e57acb7f5a153fdb2b4ed0dc","title":"what is coronavirus r number and is it rising in uk","story":"Research suggests the average number of people one person infects may be increasing – but opinions differ as to why With models suggesting that R could have risen above 1 in some parts of the UK, we look at what that means and how concerned we should be:R is a measure of the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the outbreak shrinks.The latest official estimates – produced by a group of researchers called Spi-M and based on multiple models – put R at between 0.7 and 0.9 for the whole of the UK, and between 0.7 and 1 for England alone.However, research by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge\u0026nbspUniversity suggests R is on the rise. R is now at around 1 for the south-west and just over 1 for north-west England.Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also say the overall R may be creeping up, but put R in the south-west at 1and 0.8 in the north-west.There are a number of possibilities. One is that as lockdown measures have been eased, community transmission has risen. But speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Prof John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist, suggested another reason.“The large amount of community transmission that was occurring a couple of months ago has not come to a complete stop, but has reduced enormously,” he said. Instead, he argued, the epidemic has been concentrated in settings such as care homes and hospitals, where infections spread efficiently, meaning they are now influencing the average R to a greater degree, and hence R appears to have crept up. While spread of the virus in hospitals and care homes is of deep concern, and could seed infections in the community, Edmunds’ explanation suggests the relaxation of lockdown measures is not the main driver of the upward creep in R, and different measures may be required to tackle the trend. However, Edmunds said the key question that remains is whether transmission in the community is also rising – something he says is unclear, despite the PHECambridge team arguing that the rise in R “is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings”.“They actually have that embedded in their model, that assumption,” said Edmunds, noting that the team drew on Google mobility data, which shows people moving around more. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that contact between iniduals has been going up by anywhere near the same amount.“We have been measuring people’s contact behaviour over the last two months or so and that has crept up a … very small amount, but hasn’t returned to anywhere near pre-lockdown levels.”When asked at a press briefing on Friday whether he believed R was above 1 in the community anywhere in the UK, Dr\u0026nbspPaul\u0026nbspBirrell, a co-author of the Cambridge study, said it was hard to say with certainty, “but my strong suspicion is that R is below 1 in the community, but is increasing”.The PHECambridge study reveals that while the median figure for R is 1.01 in the north-west, the full range of possible values is 0.83 to 1.18. Similar ranges are seen for the other regions.That means that it is not certain whether R is truly above or below 1 anywhere. Edmunds noted that other models give different figures: “I would stress that overall, the assessment is that it is still below 1 probably everywhere on average.” Recent lockdown relaxations are expected to be reflected in R figures over the course of the coming week.Also important to consider is the number of infections. When they are widespread across the community, an R above 1 is very concerning as it could mean a rise in cases that spreads to new areas – as happened at the start of the outbreak. Infection rates in the north-west remain high, so it is important to establish whether R in the community there is indeed above 1.However, as the overall number of infections in the community reaches low levels,\u0026nbspa large R may arise from a local outbreak or cluster of infections – a very different scenario. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If R equals 1.1, and you have 10 infected, that is only 11 new cases, which means that ramping up efforts can easily contain it – if 1,000 are infected, that is 1,100 more, which is much harder.”If R is sustained above 1, however, the situation could rapidly deteriorate. Kao noted repeated outbreaks could also raise the risk of the infection spreading to new areas or triggering a new outbreak in a hospital or care home. In addition, experts warn, at low levels of infection, uncertainty in R increases.Dr Sebastian Funk of the LSHTM said the UK government appeared to be happy with R floating around 1, despite infections remaining relatively high. “That will come with the risk of higher number of deaths and morbidity compared to a scenario where you drive the disease to lower numbers before loosening the physical distancing measures,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b66515bbb72262c6848eadf629435bb9150cad/0_176_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bca1aaf433dd7aac18f91de08b4182e5","title":"a beautiful day new zealand handshakes and hugs its way back to pre covid 19 life","story":"There may be tough economic times, and fresh cases, ahead but for now New Zealanders can enjoy a day free of coronavirus restrictions“I just had a meeting with someone and I thought, ‘Do I shake your hand?’” says Casey Allum, who was among those flocking to eat lunch at Wellington’s sunny, sparkling waterfront on Tuesday. Handshakes had been verboten until midnight on Monday, as people were required to stay a metre apart from colleagues, or two metres from strangers.“Then he came in with the handshake,” Allum says. “And I thought, ‘Oh sweet, that’s easy’.”New Zealanders woke on Tuesday to no restrictions on their daily lives for the first time since 21 March, with all remaining rules lifted after the country’s last known case of Covid-19 recovered from the virus. People in a nation that appears to have vanquished the coronavirus – for the time being – were permitted to hug and kiss strangers, to stand shoulder to shoulder at rock concerts, pray in large groups at mosques and churches, attend rugby games and attend large wedding parties or funerals.Strict border controls remain, with New Zealanders and their families the only people permitted to enter the country. They must remain in government-run quarantine for 14 days.The announcement by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, that all other rules would be lifted at midnight – earlier than expected – sparked joy for many. Juliet Gerrard, the prime minister’s chief science adviser, said she was enjoying “a cheeky midnight single malt” at the time the restrictions were officially removed. Others posted images of fireworks and wished each other a “happy new year.”\u0026nbspWhile no one was openly hugging in the streets on Tuesday, those walking outdoors were giddy with pleasure at the new status. The daring even pushed pedestrian crossing buttons with their hands, rather than the crouched elbow-jab New Zealanders have resorted to during the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“A little cheer” went up in Scott Harris’s office, where he and his central Wellington colleagues had held a “watching party” for Ardern’s news conference. He was most excited about returning to his favourite game.“Me and my mates run a lacrosse club,” he says, adding that it was “quite hard to run a contact sport with one-metre distancing.”Bars and nightclubs are also readying themselves for perhaps the most raucous Tuesday night they might ever have, as rules requiring patrons to remain seated and physically distanced, receiving only table service, were jettisoned.Kieran O’Malley’s staff at the Fork \u0026amp Brewer pub had spent the morning dragging furniture from storage ready to boost their capacity to its pre-pandemic 250 people, instead of the 100 the bar was permitted to accommodate during the later stages of Covid-19 restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It’s a godsend,” he says, adding that turnover had been “down by half” under the physical distancing rules. The government had made the right decision in shutting the country down, O’Malley says, but it had been tough and his business had needed more support.\u0026nbsp“Now we’re back to normal,” he says. “But it’s going to be a while before we build confidence back again.”In the window of one central Wellington gift shop on Tuesday, a quirky shrine to “St Ashley” has been erected Ashley Bloomfield, the mild-mannered, often cautious health official. has become a household name during the crisis, with his face printed on tea towels and turned into heroic memes online.Bloomfield, after reporting that 1,053 Covid-19 tests processed the day before had uncovered no new cases, says with a rare smile that it was “a beautiful day in Wellington”.But he warned that New Zealand had not seen the last of the pandemic.“We know this will happen,” he says, referring to the prospect of fresh diagnoses. “It may be that we detect a case at the border … we may even find cases still here on our community onshore.”Ardern has voiced her anger at learning that The Warehouse, a locally owned big-box retail chain, was considering more than 1,000 job cuts, which the company said had been accelerated by the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“I do think they are a company that has promoted themselves as being in the community and for the community,” Ardern said, adding that many smaller businesses had resisted job losses.Knowing that victory might only be temporary did not take the gloss off for New Zealanders: both the capital’s and Christchurch’s daily newspapers feature a full-page cartoon on their covers, with a kiwi – the flightless bird – standing atop the figure one, delineating New Zealand’s lowest alert level, as spectators look on in awe.\u0026nbspThe weather report reads: “A fine, still day to welcome in level 1 and all the freedoms we used to take for granted.”Betrothed couples turned their attention again to their weddings, with restrictions limiting gatherings to 100 people lifted.“I’ve already had two of the brides who were thinking about it come to me and say, ‘We can set a date and get on with it,’” says Julie Lassen, a Christchurch-based celebrant, adding that even though couples could not invite overseas guests, some had decided to proceed anyway. “It’s made a huge difference because now everyone can relax and hug each other.”The lifting of rules was good news, too, for fans of New Zealand’s most beloved sport: rugby. The domestic competition will be the first professional rugby competition in the world to welcome fans en masse to sports grounds in the Covid-19 era when games kick off in Auckland and Dunedin this weekend. Stadiums are permitted to be filled to capacity.But public health experts still worry about the state of the country’s contact tracing.The country has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and just 22 deaths after Ardern locked down New Zealand at the 200-case mark. Most say that despite the country’s seeming lucky escape from Covid-19, they would return to normal life with slightly cleaner hands than before.“We’re spraying and sanitising lots. It’s great to see every guy in the toilets washing their hands,” says O’Malley. “People sanitising their hands is great. Why not keep doing it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ecf43ee0f1c8fc7a0532702506a81c97dd63bc/0_221_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=404df69f53c2c17794ccb876554af446","title":"anthony fauci coronavirus pandemic far from over","story":"US’s top infectious disease expert calls virus his ‘worst nightmare’ as 7 million people have been infected and 400,000 have diedThe US’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his “worst nightmare”.“In a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world,” Fauci said, speaking to executives at a conference of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. “And it isn’t over yet.”About 7 million people have been infected with the coronavirus and 400,000 people are known to have died. Many countries, including the US where more than 110,000 have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas.“That’s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn’t over yet. And it’s condensed in a very, very small time frame,” said Fauci.In a videotaped discussion Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how “rapidly it just took over the planet”. Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people.The top White House infectious disease adviser said the coronavirus pandemic differed significantly from other recent public health crises including Ebola and HIV.\u0026nbsp“I mean, Ebola was scary. But Ebola would never be easily transmitted in a global way,” he said. “HIV, as important as it is, was drawn out over an extended period of time. I mean, I think the ultimate impact of Aids almost certainly will be greater than anything we’re talking about now.”The coronavirus just “took over the planet,” he said.Fauci described research on the disease as “a work in progress” and said there were still questions about whether or not survivors who were seriously ill would fully recover. The disease has been shown to have a wide range of effects on people – leaving some without symptoms while others suffer lung damage, strokes, clotting disorders and severe immune responses.Fauci was speaking after the World Health Organization (WHO) rolled back guidance that it was “very rare” for the disease to be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms.“Oh my goodness,” Fauci said. “Where is it going to end? We’re still at the beginning of it.”But Fauci said he was “very heartened” by the pharmaceutical industry, which he said, “stepped up to the plate”. There are more than 124 Covid-19 vaccines under development as of 2 June, according to the WHO, and Fauci said he was “almost certain” that more than one would be successful.“The industry is not stupid. They figured it out,” Fauci said. “There’s going to be more than one winner in the vaccine field because we’re going to need vaccines for the entire world. Billions and billions of doses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a195afb35adee7e7bbd00a7f2a90026c948aeb/0_68_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ad4855b0786ebad1151c43fd4d3975","title":"coronavirus leaves one in 10 uk charities facing bankruptcy this year","story":"Study reveals sector struggling with £10bn funding shortfall as demand for services rises One in 10 UK charities are facing bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle to cope with a £10bn shortfall caused by soaring demand for their services and lost fundraising income due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study shows.The analysis by Pro Bono Economics, an independent charity, says the coronavirus crisis will trigger a £6.4bn loss of income for charities over the next six months just as demand for extra services – ranging from health to debt advice and social care – piles on extra costs of £3.7bn.Household-name charities are also facing serious problems, with some saying the sudden rise in operating costs since the lockdown in March has forced them to use public donations to prop up services they provide under contract to local authorities and central government.They include the National Trust, which has identified a shortfall of £200m this year, Age UK, which is reporting a £42m deficit, and Cancer Research UK, which has warned it will lose about £120m in donated income over the next 12 months.“If we don’t funnel more resource to charities in the coming weeks, it’s clear that many will struggle to survive,” said Matt Whittaker, the chief executive of Pro Bono Economics.“The fact that one in 10 charities expect to go under in the next six months is on its own a shocking enough statistic. But once we add in the significant constraints being faced by many of those organisations that do survive, we’re looking at a huge hit to the overall capacity of the sector.”Whittaker said the government’s £750m bailout fund for the voluntary sector announced in April was not enough given the scale of the problem. The crisis would undermine the charity sector’s ability to nurture and encourage the upsurge of volunteering and community spirit that has emerged over the past three months. \u0026nbspKarl Wilding, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), said the Pro Bono estimates of £10bn by Christmas were in line with others he had seen. The analysis effectively updates the NCVO’s earlier estimate of a £4.3bn shortfall for the sector over three months.Wilding said the charities most likely to be hit by rising demand and falling income were those working in housing, social care, mental health and in disadvantaged communities. “The crisis has not been a great leveller for charities: some are hit harder than others. We must remember that these are organisations that people depend upon,” he said.Neil Heslop, the chief executive of Leonard Cheshire, the disability care charity, said it faced a worst-case scenario shortfall of up to £20m this year – about a sixth of its annual income – because of additional costs of up to £2m month providing personal protective equipment and extra staff at its 120 residential homes.He said the charity had not been able to access any of the government’s bailout funds and had been unable to access support for its extra costs from the local authorities and NHS bodies for whom it provides services under contract. “Without support we will face difficult decisions in the coming months,” he said.Pro Bono Economics was set up to provide economic advice to charities. Its chair is the former cabinet secretary Gus O’Donnell, and its high-powered trustees include Andy Haldane, the chief economist\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBank of England, and Clare Lombardelli, the Treasury’s chief economic adviser.Its research is based on a weekly charity tracker survey set up just after the lockdown to monitor the pressures facing civil society. The latest tracker, carried out in early June, was based on data from 261 civil society organisations across the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eefc2c249d480c25a92c3a41d269596ed7c2535/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55357b50dca034d6778d95763b581c18","title":"uk zoos and safari parks to reopen from 15 june","story":"Decision follows bankruptcy fears if coronavirus shutdown extended into summerZoos and safari parks will be allowed to reopen from 15 June, Boris Johnson is to announce on Wednesday, amid fears that some would be bankrupted if the shutdown extended into the summer months.With the government keen to relieve the tedium of the lockdown for cooped-up families without sparking a fresh increase in coronavirus cases, the prime minister will also say drive-in cinemas can open for business next week.A Downing Street official said: “People are continuing to make huge sacrifices to reduce the spread of coronavirus and avoid a second spike, but we know it is tough and where we can safely open up more attractions, and it is supported by the science, we will do so.“This is by necessity a careful process, but we hope the reopening of safari parks and\u0026nbspzoos\u0026nbspwill help provide families with more options to spend time outdoors, while supporting the industry caring for these incredible animals.”Zoos had been told as recently as last week that they should expect to remain closed indefinitely. But campaigners including the prime minister’s father had urged the government to “save our zoos”, amid warnings that some could be forced to close permanently if they continued to be unable to welcome visitors.They will not be allowed to open indoor exhibits, such as reptile houses, and catering outlets will have to remain takeaway only, to comply with distancing guidelines.MPs had been due to debate the future of zoos on Thursday. With National Trust gardens and other outdoor attractions already open, some had questioned why zoos had not been allowed to follow suit.Edward Perry, the managing director of Knowsley Safari, said: “Reopening safaris and zoos on 15\u0026nbspJune is very good news, but we feel it should have been sooner. Knowsley Safari has been ready for the past week to safely open to the public and we still can’t understand why it’s been OK for people to jump in their cars to go and get Big Macs but not to come and see our big cats.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“After being shut for such a long period, every day really does count in terms of ticket sales and generating much-needed revenue to care for over 700 animals.”Scientific advice suggests transmission of the virus is much less likely outdoors, and gatherings of up to six people from different households are now allowed in the open air, provided they maintain a two-metre distance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30060649662e807ad596ef0ef8f7b85eedd8ca2/1130_440_2366_1420/master/2366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3035e7ed926734b72246a61fc020a2ea","title":"c of e accused of utter hypocrisy over backing for black lives matter","story":"BAME vicar and trainee priest claim discrimination has blocked their church careersChurch of England bishops have been accused of “utter hypocrisy” for publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement while failing to address racism in their dioceses.Two men from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, a vicar and a trainee priest, claim discrimination has blocked their efforts to advance within the C of E hierarchy.The Rev Alwyn Pereira was rejected for seven posts as a vicar in the diocese of Bristol before he discovered a letter on his personal file saying there were “cultural differences in the way people like Alwyn communicate, and actually handle issues of truth and clarity”.Augustine Tanner-Ihm, a trainee priest who applied to become a curate, received a rejection email that stated “the demographic of the parish is monochrome white working-class, where you might feel uncomfortable”.Both men said they were angry that C of E leaders had voiced support for the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd while failing to act on systemic discrimination against BAME people within the church.Pereira said: “This is utter hypocrisy. Our church offers hope, and it is right that our bishops speak out against injustices, but it is a concern that endemic racism persists within. Over 30 years have elapsed, and our church is still ‘discussing’, still ‘listening’.”On Monday, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, tweeted that “the racism that people in this country experience is horrifying. The church has failed here, and still does, and it’s clear what Jesus commands us to do: repent and take action.”Following the tearing down of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol on Sunday, Vivienne Faull, the bishop of Bristol, said Floyd’s death had “brought the issues of racism, oppression, inequality and injustice once again into the spotlight, where they should be. These are issues that the diocese of Bristol, like many organisations, has been aware of, discussed and attempted to address. However, while we have taken some positive steps, it is clear that we have not done enough.”Pereira launched a discrimination case against the diocese of Bristol after discovering the letter on his file. Michael Hill, the bishop of Bristol at the time, wrote in July 2016: “I think the other thing I need to say, having worked closely with people from the Indian subcontinent in my past, is that I think there are cultural differences in the way people like Alwyn communicate, and actually handle issues of truth and clarity.”Pereira, who is now a vicar in Aldershot, Hampshire, is not from the Indian subcontinent. He is of Indo-Portuguese heritage, was born in Kenya and educated almost entirely in England.In a preliminary hearing, an employment tribunal heard that emails dating back to 2014 showed several bishops had blocked Pereira’s job applications, one citing “cultural eccentricities”.The employment tribunal dismissed the claim last month on the grounds it was out of time. Pereira made an internal complaint that was also ruled out of time by the C of E’s clergy discipline commission tribunal, a decision he is appealing.The support by bishops for Black Lives Matter felt like “PR spin”, he added.In a statement, Hill said he had used “racial stereotypes which were unacceptable and offensive” in his letter. “I deeply regret the incident and I wholeheartedly apologise.”Faull said Hill’s comments were “unacceptable”. She added: “I have made the commitment to address institutional racism and to recruit and support more BAME clergy. I stand behind these and my other commitments. This work won’t be easy but I will be relentless in my dedication to bringing about change.”Tanner-Ihm, a black American who is training to become a priest at Cranmer Hall in Durham, said he was shocked and angry to receive a rejection email earlier this year saying he “might feel uncomfortable” in a white working-class parish.When he challenged the view, pointing out that he was adopted by a white working-class family and had previously worked in predominantly white inner-city areas, “I got a response along the lines of ‘sorry you took it that way’.”He added: “I felt broken down. The church has said they are investigating but I don’t know how. No one has formally reached out to me.” The C of E said the letter was “plainly unacceptable” and it was seeking clarity from the diocese.The church’s director of ministry, the Rt Rev Chris Goldsmith, said: “We fully recognise that the C of E has a lot more work to do to become a place where our leadership is representative of the rich heritages of all the people of England.“We reject racism of all kinds so we must not only root out discrimination but recognise and correct the unconscious biases which each of us carry and which can undermine our intention to recognise the gifting and calling of everyone equally.”He added: “We need to be both humble and determined as we strive for the goal for full equality in our shared life.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf/355_12_2268_1361/master/2268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22def6c67f64a81bd1d8c128d448934","title":"surgisphere sapan desai lancet study hydroxychloroquine mass audit scientific papers","story":"Questions continue for Surgisphere and CEO Sapan Desai as universities deny knowledge of links to firm behind Lancet’s now-disputed blockbuster study Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one that a\u0026nbspscientific integrity expert\u0026nbspclaims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated.The audit follows a  investigation that found the company, Surgisphere, used suspect data in major scientific studies that were published and then retracted by world-leading medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.Further inquiries by the  into Surgisphere and its founder and chief executive, Dr Sapan Desai, have confirmed that:The blockbuster Lancet study based on Surgisphere data led to global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 being halted in May, because it appeared to show the drug increased deaths in Covid-19 patients.The study was retracted after a  investigation and researchers found inconsistencies in its data, which came from a database owned by Surgisphere. Desai was a co-author of the paper.The New England Journal of Medicine also retracted a study with findings based on Surgisphere data and which also listed Desai as a co-author. A third paper involving Surgipshere and Desai, which examined the impact of the drug ivermectin on Covid-19 patients, has been removed from the website SSRN, a repository for scientific papers. can confirm that studies authored by Desai and published before he established the Surgisphere database in 2019 have come under scrutiny by the scientific community and journal editors.Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist specialising in scientific integrity, examined a research paper co-authored by Desai and published in 2005 which formed the basis of his PhD in anatomy and cell biology from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.\u0026nbspThe paper, published in the Journal of Neurophysiology, examined differences in the inner-ear tissue between species of rodents. \u0026nbspIt included a collage of nine images of tissue sections obtained from different species including a mouse, a chinchilla and a tree squirrel.\u0026nbspBik works full time identifying scientific fraud, and researchers around the world send her images for review. After the retraction of the Surgisphere papers she began examining some of Desai’s other work. Bik said when she looked at the tissue images in Desai’s PhD paper, repeated patterns jumped out at her.“They are supposed to be from different rodents, yet the rat and the gerbil images have areas shared between them,” she said. “There is not only copy-pasting within the images, but also between rat cells and gerbil cells, for example.”Bik highlighted her suspicions on PubPeer, a website where scientists can provide feedback on papers.“I cannot think of any other explanation than these images have been digitally manipulated,” she told the . A spokeswoman for the journal told the  the editorial board was “aware of the situation and is reviewing the matter”. Neither Desai nor his supervising author at the University of Illinois at Chicago responded to a request for comment.According to online profiles, Desai, who is now 41, has had an extraordinary and varied career. In 2010 the online encyclopedia Wikipedia flagged his page for deletion after editors raised queries about his accomplishments.“If half of the claims in this article are true, this is indeed an exceptional young man,” one website editor wrote of Desai, who at the time was 31. “However, exceptional does not necessarily equal\u0026nbspnotable. Most claims are unsourced or sourced to the subject’s own websites. Many claims are over the top.”As well as holding at least one PhD, a medical degree and working as a vascular surgeon, Desai has also founded several companies including Surgisphere and a charity. His claims (on the deleted Wikipedia page) of having a second PhD and a Juris Doctor, or law degree, could not be independently verified by the  and Desai did not respond to questions about this.His biography also says he completed his master’s of business administration in healthcare management at Western Governors\u0026nbspUniversity. The university did not respond to requests for confirmation of this MBA. But according to the university archive he gave a speech to a graduation of university students in 2012, telling them: “Nothing that is easy is worthwhile. Because at the end of the struggle is a fountain that never stops, a fountain that showers us with the twin gifts of knowledge and wisdom.”In a video he made for a crowdfunding campaign to support a product he designed, described as a “wearable neural induction device”, Desai said he also held a PhD in neuroscience. The device, which Desai boasted could increase brain function and creativity, never came to fruition.  could find no other record of his having neuroscience qualifications and Desai did not respond to questions about this.Meanwhile Elsevier, a well-known Dutch publishing and analytics company specialising in scientific content, told the  it was “initiating the process to thoroughly re-assess” papers involving Desai.  has contacted several of Desai’s former co-authors and colleagues for comment.’s investigation has also raised questions about other Surgisphere claims. The company’s website previously stated that it was “partnered” with a handful of researchers at leading universities to complete “groundbreaking projects”, including Harvard, the University of Minnesota, Stanford, the University of Utah and the University of Glasgow. Those affiliations were removed from the Surgisphere website on Friday.When asked about collaborations, the universities said they had no formal relationship with Surgisphere.A spokeswoman for the University of Utah said it was not aware of any institutional relationship. One co-author of the Lancet paper, Dr Amit Patel, is listed as being affiliated with the university but a spokeswoman said Patel had been an unpaid adjunct professor and had not held a faculty position since January 2017.\u0026nbspOn Monday Patel announced on Twitter that he had resigned from the university. “I had verbally terminated my affiliation with the University of Utah over a week ago and formally this past Friday,” Patel wrote. “There is a much bigger story for which I still do not have the information.”He said in the tweet he was related to Desai by marriage. But this was “old news”, he said. “Despite this I still do not have the information of what happened at Surgisphere,” he said.Patel did not respond to requests from the  for comment. A university spokeswoman said: “The University of Utah does not comment on the reasons surrounding termination of academic appointments.” Harvard University medical school also said it had “no formal research agreements or partnerships” with Surgisphere, and said the reference on the company’s website could reflect Desai’s collaboration with Dr Mandeep Mehra, an investigator and cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital, which is affiliated with the medical school.Mehra was listed as a corresponding author on the Lancet study, which said: “The corresponding author and co-author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.”In a statement to the  after the retraction of the Lancet study, Mehra said his intentions “have always been to contribute to scientific discussion and to ensure that the practice of medicine is based on the best evidence available”. “During this pandemic, I have felt this even more keenly, and believe that it is imperative to provide timely data that informs both the scientific field and the care of our patients,” he said. Mehra said he understood Surgisphere to be a privately held company that purported to have data from hospitals around the world “that could be leveraged to answer important public health questions I posed in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic”.“Since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source, I no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to,” he said.“It is now clear to me that in my hope to contribute this research during a time of great need, I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions – both directly and indirectly – I am truly sorry.”A spokeswoman for the Lancet said the journal was “reviewing our requirements for data sharing and validation among authors, and data sharing following publication” as a result of the retracted study.The University of Minnesota said it had no record of anyone at the university collaborating with Surgisphere. A spokesman said the university had sought to contact the company for clarification when it discovered it was being promoted on the company’s website but that its outreach had gone unanswered.Both the University of Glasgow and Stanford told the  they were not aware of any relationship with Surgisphere.

Borissov said the government did not plan to introduce new restrictions for the time being but appealed to people to keep social distancing.Bulgaria has so far recorded 2,889 coronavirus cases, of whom 167 have died. Over the past 24 hours it recorded 79 new cases. Meanwhile Hungary and Croatia will lift restrictions on cross-border travel from Friday as the pandemic has subsided and remains under control in both countries, Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said. Japan’s lower house of parliament has approved an emergency budget worth nearly over £230bn, doubling the scale of measures to pep up the world’s third-biggest economy after the coronavirus tipped it into recession, AFP reports.Consumer spending has slowed to a crawl despite Japan’s relatively low infection numbers and death toll from the pandemic, prompting the first economic downturn since 2015.In response, lawmakers approved a second exceptional budget of 31.91tn yen (£233bn$297bn), including subsidies for smaller businesses and cash handouts for medical workers. The budget bill will be sent to the upper house and is widely expected to be enacted as early as Friday.The cash – to be raised by issuing bonds – will also be used to help finance rescue programmes and loans for struggling businesses.The government said the size of the package, including loans and investments in addition to actual fiscal spending, is worth about 117tn yen, nearly the same size as the first extra budget enacted on 30 April. Combined with that initial stimulus package, Japan’s total measures amount to 230tn yen when loan schemes are taken into account.“It will be worth it to drive the recovery,” said Oshikubo. “The two supplementary budgets alone should push up real 2020 GDP by three points. In addition, the state of emergency has now ended across Japan and the economy is set to improve.”Rescue measures include subsidies to help small companies pay rent, subsidies for companies paying leave allowances to their employees, grants to medical workers and grants to help drug and vaccine development.Japan had recorded 17,251 coronavirus infections and 919 deaths as of Tuesday, a fraction of the toll seen in global hotspots. But a spike in infections prompted Abe to declare a nationwide state of emergency, handing regional governors the power to ask people to stay indoors and call for businesses to close. He lifted the emergency declaration last month but said it would take “quite a long time” for the country to fully return to normal.Their raucous clucking deprives residents of sleep. They leave the neighbourhood “wrecked”. And food left out for them attracts “rats the size of cats” to an otherwise peaceful, leafy suburb. New Zealand’s national lockdown to quell the spread of Covid-19 appears to have vanquished the virus, but it has had one unintended consequence: the re-emergence of a plague – not of frogs or locusts but of feral chickens, a flock of which is once again menacing an area of west Auckland. Residents of Titirangi, a suburb of fewer than 4,000 people and about 20-30 feral chickens, emerged from New Zealand’s coronavirus lockdown to find a nightmare they thought had ended was not over. The feral chickens, which council contractors had been working to gently capture and rehome since their numbers peaked in 2019, had multiplied during the shutdown. Plans by Nigeria’s government to cut healthcare spending risk undermining the country’s coronavirus response and severely impacting already strained services, health and transparency groups have warned.Asylum applications in Europe fell to the lowest level for over a decade in April as borders closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, European Union figures show, compounding the challenges of people fleeing conflict and persecution, Reuters reports.“It is clear the access that potential asylum applicants had was severely restricted over the past few months, especially initially,” EASO executive director Nina Gregori told Reuters. “The situation for those in need of asylum has undoubtedly been very challenging. Already fleeing violence and persecution, the Covid-19 crisis has certainly compounded their situations.”Most applications during 2020 through April were by Syrians followed by Afghans, Venezuelans and Colombians, EASO data show.It had already become more difficult for asylum seekers to reach Europe in recent years. The bloc has blocked off previous overland migrant routes and provided aid to Libya and Turkey to inhibit crossings by sea into the EU.In April, Italy said it would not let migrant boats operated by charities dock as its ports could not be considered safe because of the coronavirus pandemic. Malta also said it could no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency.Morningeveningwhatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone.

In the meantime, the most important recent developments in the coronavirus pandemic are wrapped up in our global report below: This morning’s papers are leading with a mix of coronavirus and statue-toppling news:Coronavirus cases in Mumbai, India have passed 51,000, according to the Indian Express. The last 24 hours alone saw close to 10,000 new confirmed infections, with 9,985. The BBC points out that the city has more cases than Wuhan, China – where the virus first emerged – had at its peak. India, which has the fifth-highest number of cases, has 276,146 confirmed infections in total. It has reported 7,750 deaths, which is likely to be an underestimate. Personal after-hours shopping trips, online beauty appointments and entertainment for those queuing outside will form part of Selfridges’ coronavirus-era shopping offer when the retailer reopens on 15 June.The luxury department store group, which operates four shops in the UK, including its London flagship on Oxford Street, will not be able to reopen services such as beauty makeovers, hairdressing or its cafes and cinema because of Covid-19 restrictions. It is hoping a mix of virtual experiences and live entertainments – such as DJs – will help shoppers feel no less pampered.Property sales in most of England have swiftly rebounded to the same levels they were just before the lockdown, although London lags behind the rest of the country and markets in Scotland and Wales remain closed, according to website Zoopla.“Lower asking prices for homes sold over the lockdown period may drag down indices over May, but this new data suggests house price growth is set to remain positive in the next two months,” said Zoopla research director, Richard Donnell.However, London’s market has failed to rebound, with buyers seeking properties outside the capital, as work-from-home policies may leave many more employees no longer needing to commute into the city."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Such plants are 35 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forestsFaster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate Chaos"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eliminating Covid-19 through tougher short-term measures represents the “most scientifically sound” strategy for Ireland, according to a group of Irish researchers.In an open letter published on Monday, the group of scientists and academics says Ireland has “come to a watershed moment . . . the path we choose will determine our future for years to come”.They acknowledge the huge impact already on the economy but suggest measures now be deployed to “crush” the virus on an all-island basis, as many other countries have done. This, they add, is possible over a number of weeks not months.Signatories include public health specialists infectious disease experts, virologists, immunologists, and doctors including respiratory and intensive care consultants working in acute hospitals – many of whom worked on the frontline during the height of the pandemic.“Our current policy is to live with the virus under a long-term mitigation strategy, with the risk of future surges and lockdowns until when, or if, a vaccine becomes available. We have another option: we can do as many other countries have done, choose to suppress and eliminate this virus – ‘crushing the curve’,” they suggest.‘Normal’Because of a timely response the island of Ireland managed to bring the epidemic under control, they point out.“A range of emergency restrictions imposed by the two Governments, following scientific advice, stopped our healthcare systems being overwhelmed and saved many lives. The public support these restrictions, and report that they clearly understood the need for them.”All this had come at a huge cost, they note, with enormous sums of money spent many losing jobs and businesses wondering if they will be able to open again.People will once again feel confident in using public transport, returning to school, going out to eat and to shop, pressure on the healthcare system will be relieved, and trust in our economy will be restored, they accept.“For the economies on our island, this would be enormously valuable. Vulnerable people will be effectively protected.”There was, however, a push to get back to “normal” as fast as possible. “What does ‘normal’ look like if the virus continues to circulate? Right now, public transport is planning for 20 per cent of ‘normal’ capacity, pubs and restaurants 30 per cent, schools, at best only 50 per cent.“The costs of childcare, already high, will be impossible for many. Many workplaces will need expensive re-design. Many people will drop out, or be pushed out of the labour force. All of these are real costs, and will, we believe, far exceed the short-term costs of lockdown.”“For these reasons we strongly encourage the Governments to take resolute actions to suppress this pandemic at once. Eliminating the virus represents the most scientifically sound strategy in terms of public health and economics alike.”“Several countries have already largely halted the virus, including South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Greece, China and Iceland, by continuing public health measures, including the use of masks, active fast contact tracing and testing, and sensible restrictions on travel.”Such measures were planned for both parts of this island, “but they must be enhanced and coordinated – with the aim of achieving ambitious suppression targets”.This should be on the basis of first achieving suppression and elimination of Covid-19, “and then we must maintain it”.Realistic exit strategyThese countries achieved suppression, and some have demonstrated they can also maintain it in the face of new cases, as seen in South Korea. “Each country has developed its own solutions, to fit its own needs, and we can do the same on our joint island,” the scientists underline.“All our sacrifices over the last two months have driven down the number of cases, and given us a precious window of opportunity that we must not squander. This is a decisive moment in the history of our island.”The goal should be to suppress the number of new cases to zero as soon as possible, and to keep them there. Given political leadership, an agreed and scientifically sound strategy, and cooperation from citizens, “this can be done, and done in weeks, not in months”.“When we reach this goal, new infections have to be closely monitored for the foreseeable future under a robust, rapid, and vigilant testtraceisolate infrastructure.”Alternatively, if the country decides to live with the virus, they believe, “extensive, and expensive, restrictions will continue for the foreseeable future. A vaccine will take at least two years, and there is no established treatment”.Societies that have suppressed and eliminated this pandemic will enjoy considerably greater freedoms and prosperity than those where the virus persists, the signatories predict. Travel, tourism, and trade with other successful countries would be straightforward and beneficial.Given Ireland’s geography, population size and social cohesion, suppression was a realistic exit strategy “a genuine way out of our current economic and social standstill”.Lead signatories are epidemiologist Prof Anthony Staines of DCU infectious diseases ecologist Prof Gerard Killeen of UCC and immunologist Dr Tomás Ryan of TCD.The letter and signatories are available at http:crushthecurve.ie* An early version of this story incorrectly stated that 1,000 scientists had signed the letter.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsGuidance that people over 60 should wear a face mask “seems like a practical approach” but it depends on the setting, the Covid-19 Oireachtas committee has been told.Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun said the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would review the advice issued this week by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that everyone over 60 should wear a face mask.Dr de Gascun said “we recommend them for people who are asymptomatic and for those who cannot maintain adequate physical distance at the moment such as on public transport”.He said earlier there was always a reluctance to make it mandatory for people to wear a mask but he acknowledged that the uptake was not as large as they thought for people to follow the recommendation in such situations.He said there is time to “scale up manufacturing capacity” to supply face coverings to households if there is a resurgence of coronavirus.Dr de Gascun said there was inequity for some people who could not afford to buy their own mask and acknowledged that it could be a good idea to supply masks, while maintaining supplies of medical grade masks for healthcare workers in clinical settings.Dr de Gascun pointed out, however, that the evidence for the wearing of cloth masks or non-medical grade masks “is not fantastic, to be honest. There’s a nice plausible hypothesis that people use that it stops the particles, that it’s trapping the virus as well. We don’t actually have great evidence in that area.”Labour TD Duncan Smith called for the Government to supply re-usable masks to every household in the country in light of the lifting of restrictions.Chair of the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group Prof Philip Nolan warned however that there was a view that “if only we had testing and tracing and a face mask we could do all the other things we used to do”.He said that the best way to suppress the virus was to adhere to the public health guidance including maintaining social distancing.Government strategy The strategy laid out by Government is the right strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, Prof Nolan told the committee earlier on Tuesday morning.Prof Nolan said that “different scientists have different judgments in the face of incomplete evidence”when asked about the open letter by dozens of Irish researchers calling for a policy rethink to crush Covid-19.He said the strategy is not one of mitigation or living with an ongoing or significant levels of transmission, but of suppression.The letter by leading scientists and epidemiologists called for stronger short-term measures to eliminate the virus.Prof Nolan said, however, that he fully supported the recommendations of the NPHET. “I support them and they accord with my judgment. No strategy utterly insulates us from the virus.”He told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly that there will be renewed outbreaks of Covid-19 disease across Europe which would be in “small waves.”Prof Nolan told the committee that “the management of the second wave will be different from the first wave. There could be more targeted measures introduced to control future outbreak.”Asked by Mr Donnelly if Irish society will be fully functioning by the end of the year, Prof Nolan said, “I don’t have a crystal ball on this and could not give a probability on the likelihood”.“Our behaviour will continue to be modified by this virus for some time to come.”He said that when people talk about a second wave it “gives the impression that some overwhelming second wave will wash over” society.“It is probable that at some point in the future an incidence of the virus will increase again,” he said.

It was previously due to arrive on Tuesday afternoon but was delayed after experiencing a technical issue.It is its fourth time visiting Shannon airport, with the other three arrivals being transit flights in which they stopped in Ireland for fuel.Niall Maloney, Director of Operations at Shannon Airport, said the aircraft is “the size of Croke Park”.“It’s done its route from China, to Kazakhstan, it has just taken off from Azerbaijan. and we expect it to be in Shannon at about 10 past two this afternoon. The most important part is it is bringing PPE into Ireland. It’s got nearly 900,000 surgical gowns and other medical equipment on board.”Mr Maloney described the history of the aircraft, which was designed in the 1980s.“It was part of the Soviet rule at the time, but it is an Ukrainian-owned aircraft now and it was part of the space programme,” he said.“It really lost its way. It was a moth ball for about 80 years\u0026nbspbut it came back in the late 1990s as a commercial plane and literally has just been flying the longest pieces ever flown in an aircraft, the heaviest pieces ever flown in an aircraft.”Mr Maloney added that the airport was “delighted to be able to play our part” but urged people not to come to the airport to view the plane due to social distancing measures.“We’re asking people not to come to the airport, because the last time it came to Shannon there were 3,000 people who came to the fences to look at the plane.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosA policy proposal that would see Ireland’s carbon emissions reduce by an average of just under 6.5 per cent a year has been rejected by the Green Party in government formation talks.The Greens are adamant that their red line of an average annual reduction of 7 per cent in carbon emissions to 2030 must be met. It is understood that a mix of policies that would see an average reduction of just under 6.5 per cent has been tabled, with sources suggesting it primarily came from Fine Gael. It is understood that a number of policies in the agriculture area, which could affect the livestock industry, would push the policy mix tabled by the larger parties towards the Greens’ 7 per cent goal.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is said to be pushing for exact detail on how the 7 per cent target can be met. Some sections of the Greens already believe that an annual average emissions target by 2030 is insufficient and that there should instead be a 7 per cent year-on-year decrease.The Greens are insisting that measures to reach the target cannot be backloaded until the end of the decade.The party has also called for the halting of the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure, including the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant earmarked for the Shannon estuary area.This is seen as equally important as the 7 per cent target, but a view has taken hold in the party that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are backsliding on previous commitments in the area. Land use, such as the rewetting of bogs, is also said to be a sticking point.Significant winsSources in the larger two parties said the Greens were getting significant wins in the areas of transport infrastructure which they could point to as helping to tackle climate change. Transport and housing policy have yet to be signed off.The talks will continue today with meetings between the respective negotiation teams, as well as Dara Calleary, Simon Coveney and Catherine Martin, the three deputy leaders. Leaders Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Mr Ryan may also meet.Ms Martin, who will challenge Mr Ryan for leadership of the Greens, is said by others in the talks to be among the most hardline on the Green side, along with finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan. Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman, who is close to Mr Ryan, has also in recent days been hardline as the Greens seek to pin down their main policy goals. Sources close to Ms Martin said “she desperately wants to get a deal she can support”.Several other members of the Green parliamentary party, who spoke privately, said the focus was to try to secure the best possible deal by Friday. Most said the leadership was a secondary consideration at this moment in time. “The most important thing now is if we get to Friday and get a good agreement and there is no major split, we can take it from there by putting it to the membership,” said one TD involved in the process.The other two parties were also surprised that during the plenary session yesterday the Greens brought up the issue of medicinal cannabis and suggested provisions to allow its use should be included in the programme for government. The suggestion was rejected.It is hoped that a deal can be finalised by the end of the week. A sitting of the Dáil on Thursday next week has been cancelled, with the time set to be used by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens to sell a deal, if one is agreed, to their party memberships.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275047.1591736699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord fat cats go bats as captains of industry take over the chamber","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDanny McCoy, CEO of Ibec, was appearing before the Covid-19 committee, giving the view from the premium seats, in the premium seat.  Photograph: Alan BetsonChampagne corks popped in corporate corners, fat cats punched the air with pin-striped paws and, in spacious homes with private bars, silver-haired golfing buddies turned towards the TV, raised their glasses and burst into song.“Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, we love you sooooo . . .”Despite the ongoing closure of their clubhouses, the Captains of Industry were in high spirits because while they know they really run the country and pull the strings, now everyone else could see that too. They are the ones in full control.No need to pretend anymore.It was early Tuesday afternoon when it happened. Nobody seemed to notice. Perhaps because it appeared so natural.In the Dáil chamber, in the Taoiseach’s seat, sat a man in a well-cut suit looking very much like he belonged there. Doing the usual, answering questions from TDs. But his name was not Leo Varadkar.It was Danny McCoy, the chief executive of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec).Not so much a takeover as an assertion of the ruling order. (Just in case any of those Greens with their social consciences and “ferment yer own programmes for government” mentality were getting ideas above their station in the excitement of the coalition formation talks.)So there he was. The man from Ibec. Sitting in the seat of ultimate political power in Dáil Éireann. Needless to say there wasn’t a complaint from the Fine Gael benches around him. Nor, for that matter from the Fianna Fáil ranks across the floor.Sure lookit, if you weren’t looking at him you’d only be looking at that Tom Parlon from the Construction Industry Federation.Oh-oh! There go the champagne corks again.Those images on the TV monitor in Leinster House could have spooked some of the new Green TDs and Senators contemplating the political future had they looked up and seen Danny McCoy in full flow in the Dáil at this critical juncture in the government formation talks.But wait. No need for alarm.Danny was merely appearing before the Covid-19 committee, giving the view from the premium seats, in the premium seat.He was gone again in a couple of hours. His industry prefers to operate in less conspicuous parts of Leinster House and Government Buildings.Apparently, Cork socialist Mick Barry fainted in the corridor when he glimpsed the Ibec chief holding forth from the Taoiseach’s chair, while Richard Boyd Barrett was conveyed senseless from the chamber by a team of ushers.But the sight was a thrilling one for our high net worth visionaries.“The last time I felt this happy I was listening to an interview with Pat McDonagh from Supermac’s,” boomed one.Apart from that, the other highlight of a long day in the chamber was from virologist Dr Cillian De Gascun, who magnificently bamboozled the TDs on the origins of Covid-19 and its link to bats.“SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the coronaviridae family,” he told the politicians. “Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural host for the virus, the recombinogenic nature of coronaviruses means it can be difficult to identify the ultimate source because different parts of the genome can have different origins. This is in contrast to influenza viruses, for example, which reassert but do not typically undergo homologous recombination within ribonucleic acid – RNA – segments.”Anyway, it seems that bats are riddled with viruses. The Rhinolophus affinis bat is in the frame for our current pandemic, although we must not forget Malayan pangolins.And, on the subject of bats, there were some very strange reports trickling from the top secret talks between the Greens and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Specific items were down for discussion, but Green negotiator Ossian Smyth wanted to discuss medicinal cannabis and have a commitment in the programme for government that GPs will be able to dispense it to patients.With the clock running out on the time left to form an administration, one hour of the two-hour morning session was sidetracked with this unscheduled discussion on cannabis.“I felt like rolling a spliff myself after the first half hour,” one of the negotiators told a political colleague afterwards.There were mixed signals coming from Agriculture House, which is the building on the Leinster House campus in Kildare Street where the talks are taking place.Talk of two factions now: the Eamon Ryan faction and the Catherine Martin faction. Martin is challenging Ryan for the leadership, an action which activists correctly insist is in accordance with their constitutional rules. But it isn’t mandatory either.It\u0026nbspseems a strange time to launch a leadership tilt when so much is at stake.But nothing much is escaping the talks in terms of leakage. The participants are being very cagey. But there is no sense that this is anywhere near being a done deal. Tuesday’s sessions were being touted as the make-or-break ones. But, yet again, the negotiations drag on.Apart from one session on education, the Dáil has cleared the Wednesday schedule for statements on climate change. All day, starting at 9.30 in the morning and finishing at nine at night. It’ll be scintillating.Meanwhile, the teams will continue their efforts to sign off on a policy paper.Around Leinster House, the mood keeps swinging from pessimistic to mildly optimistic and back again."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Lam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275379.1591776982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"little britain comedy taken off netflix bbc iplayer over use of blackface","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatt Lucas (L) and David Walliams in a  Little Britain sketch.

Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275063.1591744660!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"malachy mcallister expected to be deported from us today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMalachy McAllister has fought for decades to avoid being deported from the United States where he has lived for more than two decades.Former INLA prisoner Malachy McAllister is expected to be deported from the United States on Wednesday after the latest attempt to prevent his deportation failed. Mr McAllister has fought for decades to avoid being deported from the United States where he has lived for more than two decades. He was jailed for seven years for two INLA attacks on Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers during the 1981 hunger strikes.He was released in 1985 and took no further part in paramilitary activity. He fled his home in Belfast in 1988 after a loyalist gun attack on his home and now ran a construction business in New Jersey.Mr McAllister was formally detained by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday after he surrendered himself and was transported to an ICE detention facility in New Jersey. He is expected to fly back on Wednesday. Dozens of people turned out in New Jersey to express their support for Mr McAllister on Tuesday. The archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan was among those who made representations on behalf of Mr McAllister.‘A sad day’New Jersey senator Bob Menendez condemned the move to deport the New Jersey resident, noting that Mr McAllister and his family have resided lawfully in New Jersey for over twenty years. “Today is a sad day for the McAllister family and New Jersey’s Irish community. Deporting a community leader who poses no national security or public safety threat is not only a clear injustice, but also contrary to our nation’s values,” he said. “By forcefully deporting Mr. McAllister to a place he fled because his life was put in danger, the Trump Administration is showing the immorality of their indiscriminate immigration policies.” Irish-American group Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) also lobbied against Mr McAllister’s deportation. James McKay, the head of the group, said it was with great sadness that the AOH learned of his imminent deportation. “We have not just been forced to say goodbye to a member and a brother his American-born US citizen grandchildren have been deprived of their grandfather, the Northern Ireland peace process has lost a voice in America, the US economy has lost an entrepreneur who created two successful tax-payingjob-producing businesses.”Mr McAllister (62) who has an Irish passport, is expected to fly back to Dublin. Immigration lawsHe was recently involved in an accident when he was hit by a car while cycling and it is understood that he may need medical assistance to be transported by plane. His expected deportation on Wednesday comes six months after he was granted a last-minute stay. Among the judges that have heard his case over the years, is president Donald Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry. In 2006, she criticised the federal government’s immigration policy as it related to Mr McAllister’s case. “We cannot be the country we should be if, because of the tragic events of September 11th, we knee-jerk remove decent men and women merely because they may have erred at one point in their lives,” she said at the time. Immigration laws around the residency rights of undocumented and illegal immigrants have tightened under the Trump administration. In particular, while the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agency previously tended to grant stays of removal when members of Congress intervened, that policy was changed by the Department of Homeland Security in 2017.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

The great schism of 1846, following Robert Peel’s repeal of the Corn Laws, kept the Tories out of office for 20 years as free traders and landowning farmers split. In the early 20th century, efforts to secure preferential tariffs for British and Empire agricultural products caused another rift. The UK’s entry into the Common Market in the early 1970s was dominated by arguments over the impact on Commonwealth farmers of the EEC’s trade barriers.Now that we have left the EU and are negotiating trading arrangements with the bloc and other countries, these internal arguments have broken out once more. Cabinet ministers have reportedly been at loggerheads over how to honour election commitments to uphold food production standards in a trade deal with the United States.This has been sold to the country as a determination to keep “chlorinated chicken” off the supermarket shelves, as though the rows and rows of cheap, home-bred poultry, all weighing in at 4lbs 2oz, have been leading the life of Riley before getting the chop. In reality, it is protectionism masquerading as a food standards issue since nothing associated with the US processes will harm anyone. This is about backing British farming against the might of America.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers Union, has gone so far as to warn of an existential threat to the entire industry if it faced unfettered competition from the US, because domestic producers would find it impossible to compete on price.The most annoying thing about this debate is the attempt to pretend it is something else. Ministers fall over themselves to deny it has anything to do with protectionism even as MPs are targeted for failing to “stand up for British farmers”. Why not admit the intent and take the argument from there? Protecting domestic agriculture from cheap imports is hardly new. Free traders must acknowledge that farming is no less vulnerable to competition from outside than steel or coal or shipbuilding, all of which have gone under in the past 30 years.At issue is which is more important: the industry or the consumer? Free traders following the Ricardian principles of comparative advantage maintain that an overall increase in economic welfare is achieved by importing from countries that produce goods more cheaply. But there is no point pretending this does not harm specific sectors. After the Corn Laws were repealed, domestic agriculture went through a period of depression in the late 1800s up until the First World War. Since the Second World War, farming has been shielded first by UK tariffs and then by membership of the Common Agricultural Policy.We left the EU to forge free trade deals with other countries and yet at the first hurdle the old protectionist questions are being asked once more. One battleground is the Agriculture Bill which is to be given a second reading in the House of Lords today. In the Commons a few weeks ago, 20 Tory MPs rebelled by backing an amendment to enshrine in law existing welfare standards. The Government fought it off but it is likely to be revisited in the Upper House, where the Conservatives do not have a majority, and reinserted in the Bill, whereupon it will come back to the Commons. A major celeb-backed campaign is under way to ensure these protections are given statutory force.The Government opposes this but insists it has no intention of watering down animal welfare regulations and will not accept imports from countries that do not observe our standards. Yet that may well scupper a trade deal with the US. Why would Donald Trump, or Joe Biden for that matter, want to sign an agreement that kept American livestock producers out of UK markets while allowing our lamb and beef farmers access to theirs?It’s either free trade or it isn’t. A half-way house, whereby some goods that do not conform to UK regulations are subject to tariffs, is being explored but does not look promising. A leaked letter from No 10 instructing ministers to have “no specific policy” on animal welfare in US trade talks has heightened concern among farmers that a sell-out is on the way.One reason why the proposed US-EU trade deal never materialised was because the Europeans would not allow tariff free access to American chickens which cost 20 per cent less to produce. Farmers say that is because they are kept in dreadful conditions so there is no level playing field. But we also have intensive poultry farming, if not on the same scale. World Trade Organisation rules do not differentiate the methods of production when it comes to trade deals.Moreover, if US chickens are sold here and are properly labelled, no one has to buy them. But price is important for many consumers. Free-range chickens can cost four or five times as much as a broiler sold in a cut-price supermarket. The American birds may be cheaper still. In any case, a deal with the US also opens a huge market for UK farmers whose higher quality and ethical standards will be a marketing advantage in pitching for the custom of better-off Americans.Under the Agriculture Bill, farmers will continue to receive most of the support they were paid under the CAP until 2022 through a series of transition arrangements that will also protect the environment and ensure high production standards. But, they ask, what will be the point of these if they are then left to the mercies of cheap imports from the US and elsewhere? In addition, if there is no UK-EU trade deal by the end of the year, their exports to Europe will become more expensive.Are we really looking at the possible extinction of British agriculture? Aside from the impact on the livelihoods of farmers and the countryside they manage, it would be a serious matter, given how vulnerable this country – which imports 40 per cent of its food – is to a breakdown in supply lines.If the vaunted free trade deal with America looks like foundering over agriculture, which way will Boris Johnson jump? He needs to land this deal, especially as talks with the EU are not going well. But he faces the age-old choice for Tory prime ministers: farmers or consumers? It will be hard to placate both, as Peel discovered.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"half people tested italys coronavirus epicentre bergamo have","story":"More than half of people in the epicentre of Italy’s outbreak have been infected with coronavirus and the region has the highest rate of antibodies yet discovered, a study by health authorities has found.The city of Bergamo and its surrounding province were hit hard by the virus, which was first detected in Italy in late February but is believed to have been present in January or even earlier.Blood tests carried out on more than 20,000 people in Bergamo and the surrounding area between April 23 and June 3 revealed that 57 per cent of people had antibodies indicating they had come into contact with Covid-19. Among medical staff, the proportion was 30 per cent.The study suggests that the area may be approaching herd immunity levels – experts suggest the threshold for achieving herd immunity against coronavirus may be around 60-65 per cent.The idea of herd immunity is that if a certain percentage of the population is immune to an infectious disease, the disease will stop spreading.Testing has shown that around 17 per cent of London’s population now has Covid-19 antibodies, while the figure for the rest of the country is 5 per cent.In New York City, around 25 per cent of the population has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.Blood testing in Spain revealed that 5 per cent of the overall population has antibodies, with the figure rising to 7 per cent in Barcelona and 11 per cent in Madrid. In Stockholm, around 7 per cent of people have developed antibodies to Covid-19.Several studies suggest that people who have been infected with Covid-19 gain some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long.Bergamo is in the northern region of Lombardy, where more than 16,000 people have lost their lives to the virus – nearly half Italy’s total of 34,000 fatalities.Italy has recorded 235,000 infections, of which 35,000 people are still infected.Bergamo became a chilling symbol of Italy’s battle against the virus when a convoy of army trucks had to be drafted in to remove more than 60 coffins full of bodies from the city’s overwhelmed cemetery.In a report last month, Italy’s national statistics agency said the number of overall deaths in Bergamo had jumped by 568 per cent in March, compared with previous years.That made it by far the worst affected part of Italy.Population density and atmospheric pollution have been posited for the high number of infections and deaths in Lombardy.There are other factors – the region is renowned for its manufacturing, with many businesses having commercial links with China, where the virus originated.Despite Italy declaring a strict national lockdown in early March, many people in the industrious region continued to go to work, with mobile phone data suggesting up to 40 per cent of people were out and about.Lombardy is still discovering hundreds of new cases a week, but the aggressive nature of the virus may be diminishing, experts said.“Something has happened in terms of the aggressiveness of the virus,” said Sergio Harari, an expert in pneumology from San Giuseppe Hospital in Milan. “We don’t know whether it’s something in the viral load or whether it’s a mutation.”While Lombardy and other northern regions emerge slowly from the emergency, several of Italy’s 20 regions are recording no new cases, including Sardinia, Umbria, Valle d’Aosta, Molise, Abruzzo, Calabria and Basilicata.Italy has begun rolling out a contact-tracing app called Immuni that people can download to their mobile phones.The app enables users to find out whether they have come into contact with someone infected with Covid-19.If they have, they would undergo tests and self-quarantine to stop the spread of the virus.Testing of the app has started in four regions – Puglia, Abruzzo, Liguria and Marche – and has been downloaded two million times.The more people download the app, the more chance there is of them being notified if they come into contact with a positive case, said Paola Pisano, the minister for innovation. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prioritising betting shops schools government shows exit strategy","story":"As a father of six, Boris Johnson could reasonably be expected to be well versed in the trials and tribulations of raising school-age children, even if his youngest is still a babe in arms.Yet the latest Government u-turn on reopening schools to all primary children for a month before the summer holidays suggests Downing Street may have mislaid its Mumsnet log-in details.For there are now fears that secondary pupils might not return even in September, despite mounting concerns about the detrimental impact on pupil progress.Having announced that non-essential retail — including betting shops — will re-open from Monday June 15, it seems children have been pushed down No 10’s list of priorities. As Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, succinctly put it when she pointed out the ridiculousness of theme parks re-opening before schools: “Children’s education does matter as much as the economy, We need to invest in it because without that there’s a risk that childhood is just going to be furloughed.”With a YouGov poll finding on Monday that two thirds of parents were “struggling to maintain discipline and motivation” while home-schooling during the crisis, the Government’s exit strategy doesn’t appear particularly family focused. This is despite a poll by the National Foundation for Educational Research finding that more than half of parents were willing to send their children back when they open more fully. As many Tories who have supported schools reopening have been at pains to point out — only when children are back in school can parents properly return to work.Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons education select committee, on Tuesday warned of an epidemic of educational poverty if children do not get back into the classroom sooner.It followed an admission by Health Secretary Matt Hancock at Monday’s Downing Street press conference that secondary schools would not reopen until September “at the earliest” despite saying coronavirus was “in retreat” across the UK.The over cautious approach angered MPs and ministers in light of the World Health Organisation’s recommendation that schools should reopen — with no evidence of spikes among school children in countries that have allowed them to return to class. Last month, a video conference of education ministers from around the EU heard the reopening of schools in 22 European countries had not led to any significant increase in coronavirus infections among children, parents or staff.Denmark became the first European country to tentatively reopen its nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools on 15 April, followed by Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and France. Schools will remain closed until September in Italy and only partially reopened in Spain.So why does the Government appear to be turning a blind eye not only to the needs of children but also the scientific evidence?One senior Tory blamed the climb-down squarely on Gavin Williamson, saying the Education Secretary had “done a Ted Heath” by caving into the unions. Unions including the National Education Union, the National Association of Headteachers, and Naswut remain unconvinced that it is safe for schools to reopen, and a number of Labour-run councils have refused to allow pupils to return. “Gavin’s not just kowtowed to the unions but also ‘the Blob’,” said the MP.“The civil servants in the Department for Education are best described as well-meaning Lib Dems. It’s not that they’re left wing, they’re just mushy. He’s clearly been persuaded by them.”The capitulation is all the more surprising considering it was Mr Johnson\u0027s chief adviser Dominic Cummings who advised Michael Gove to take on the unions when he was his special advisor to the former Education Secretary from 2011 to 2014. Yet according to another senior Tory: “This is all a result of the Government having no clear strategic view on where they want to be. Betting shops re-opening but not schools? They announced that all primary school children would return for a month before the school holidays without thinking of answers to the questions that would inevitably arise. They needed to bring parents on board but all this retreat does is make them even more wary of sending their children back. Other European countries have got on with it, why can’t we?”On Wednesday evening, a source close to Mr Williamson insisted the ambition to have all primary school children to return before the summer holidays was only if it was feasible to so, adding: It was always subject to review.Denying he had surrendered to the unions or \u0027the Blob, the source added: If he had caved in, we wouldn\u0027t have more than 70 per cent of schools reopened right now. As Gavin said in his statement — he wants all pupils to be back by September.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"satellite images appear put madeleine mccann suspects vehicle","story":"Satellite images taken shortly after Madeleine McCann’s disappearance appear to show the prime suspect’s camper van parked just a mile away from her hotel and are being examined by German police, the  has learnt, as authorities appeal for more evidence from the public.Heriberto Janosch González, a Spanish criminologist who works in computer science, was contacted by officers from Germany\u0027s Federal Criminal Police Office just hours after he sent them a picture he uncovered this week from early June 2007 — just weeks after the young girl disappeared.The van, a distinctive white and yellow VW T3 Westfalia from the 1980s appears to be parked near a run-down farmhouse where the suspect lived until late 2006 and could offer clues as to where Christian Brückner went in the aftermath of Madeleine’s abduction.The farmhouse had been left ramshackle with no sign of occupancy  in 2006, it\u0027s British owner said.Sitting at the end of a dusty dirt road, it is surrounded by hilly scrubland and has a number of deep wells close by, which Mr Janosch González said police should now search.On Tuesday night, the family’s lawyer in Portugal told the  that Kate and Gerry “don’t know much more than we know.”“I spoke to the family four days ago and what I think is they do not know much more than us.”Asked if the family knew what evidence the German police insist that they have to show that their daughter is dead, he said: “As a matter of fact they do not. The prosecutor should explain his point of view to them, because they do not know.”In Germany, it emerged today that Nicole Fehlinger, a reported ex-girlfriend who he stayed with in Portugal, had been interviewed by police nine months ago.Brückner and Fehlinger are known to be close, and she accepted the convicted paedophile into her home in the months after Madeleine’s disappearance.It came as a British ex-girlfriend of Brückner\u0027s claimed he told her he had a horrible job to do in Praia da Luz the night before Madeleine disappeared. He told the woman who was not identified: It\u0027s something I have to do, and it will change my life. You won\u0027t be seeing me for a while, according to The Sun.Brückner dated two British women while he lived in Prai da Luz, both of whom have reportedly given evidence to the police. It is also claimed that he told friends just don\u0027t go there when asked if he had anything to do with the disappearanceSpeaking to the , Mr Janosch González said he was confident the van belonged to Brückner.“The satellite images depend on the definition and perspective, so it was very difficult to do an exact analysis, but the measures and proportions, the location of the windshield, correspond well to a VW T3 Westaflia campervan,” he said.“I sent an email at midnight on Sunday and got a reply at 6.30am on Monday, so I think they were interested. They asked me how I got the pictures and I told them it was open source from Nasa.“I have always had an interest in this case, and have degrees in psychology and criminology, so when I heard about the farmhouse I wanted to look into it.”In the months after Madeleine’s disappearance, the prime suspect turned up at a restaurant in a remote village 40 miles from Praia da Luz asking for a job.There, he knew Nicole Fehlinger, a foster carer who looked after vulnerable German children.On Tuesday, her father Dieter said: If I had known then what I know about Christian now I would have killed him.When I first met him I was certainly suspicious of him.My daughter was interviewed by German police between nine months and a year ago in connection with Christian.I don\u0027t think she will be making any further comment.He added that Nicole also had a young blonde daughter living there at the time Bruckner was in the area.The news comes as British victims of sexual assaults in the Algarve were urged to contact police, after an Irish woman said that her rape could be linked to the man suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann.Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said that German authorities believe Christian Brückner has committed more crimes against British, Irish and American tourists and that any new information could help with their investigation.An Irish woman who was raped in a nearby town in 2004 said that her attacker, who has never been found, spoke English with a German accent and had blonde hair and piercing blue eyes — all of which match the description of Brückner.The victim, Hazel Behan, was working as a holiday rep in Praia da Rocha at the time, and told the  that her information was now being taken seriously by the politan Police and that they would be in touch with Portuguese officials.The German paedophile has been convicted of raping a 72-year-old American tourist at a luxury beachfront villa in Praia da Luz in 2005, and has a long history of sexual assaults against women and children.On Tuesday, police in Germany announced they are reviewing the disappearance of yet another German girl in light of the new Madeleine suspect. Police in Bayreuth, a small German town just outside of Nuremberg, confirmed that Brückner is “under investigation” in the case of Peggy Knobloch, who disappeared without trace on May 7, 2001 on her way home from school. On July 2, 2016, parts of her skeleton were discovered in the Thuringian Forest. Although there is currently no evidence that the suspect in the \u0027Maddie\u0027 case is also a possible perpetrator in the \u0027Peggy\u0027 case, Bayreuth\u0027s chief public prosecutor Martin Dippold told the German newspaper Bild: He is now also under investigation in the case \u0027Peggy\u0027.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two metre rule left draft government guidance reopening pubs","story":"The two-metre rule has been omitted from draft guidance on reopening pubs and restaurants, it has emerged.Instead, the Government proposals refer to wider spacing between customers and installing safeguarding measures, raising the prospect that officials are preparing to change the rule.The hospitality industry is waiting for the Government to issue its updated guidance on how venues can reopen.A draft of the guidance seen by Propel, the hospitality industry newsletter, encourages staff to split into shift teams and the use of radios or telephones or other electronic devices when sending orders from service areas to kitchens. However, no specific requirement on the distance required between tables has been stipulated in the document, which instead makes reference to wider spacing and the use of screens and barriers where appropriate.Previously, Government guidance for restaurants said: Provide where possible for two-metre social distancing. It added that venues should provide floor marking to signal distances of two metres.On Tuesday night, a Tory MP welcomed the proposed change. The MP said guiding venues to keep people at distance instead of specifying two metres is what we need to do, adding: If businesses can boost capacity and break even, that means they can keep going.  Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, repeatedly declined to say on Tuesday whether the Government is planning to reduce the two-metre rule before restaurants and pubs are allowed to reopen. He told the Downing Street press conference that the rule remains under review, adding: When it is safe to do so, we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance.There are other countries in the world that have moved from two metres to closer distances. Of course, they are further along in terms of their road map, in terms of opening up businesses.Mr Sharma said pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will not be able to reopen until July 4 at the earliest.Venues will be asked to define the maximum number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing, according to the draft guidance. This would need to take into account total indoor and outdoor space, specific venue characteristics such as furniture, as well as likely pinch points and busy areas. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been urged to ditch the two-metre rule for restaurants and pubs or risk venues not being able to reopen.On Monday, UK Hospitality wrote to the Prime Minister warning that specifying a two-metre rule would mean venues only being able to generate 30 per cent of normal revenues and urged him to halve it.The difference between the two is the avoidance of mass redundancies and a quicker withdrawal of furlough as revenues return to normal more quickly, the letter to Mr Johnson says.Cutting the rule to one metre would significantly safeguard jobs, the trade body told The .Chief executive Kate Nicholls said: Opening with a two-metre social distancing rule would see many venues operating at around 30 per cent capacity, which would be completely unviable for almost every business.Reducing the distance to one metre would allow businesses to operate at around 70 per cent capacity, which might allow them to at least break even.Asked about the draft guidance, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: We are working at pace to develop safe ways for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at the earliest opportunity it is safe to do so, through our pubs and restaurants taskforce.This work is progressing well, bringing together representatives from the industry to develop guidance as we have done for other businesses and sectors.Pub landlords have welcomed the apparent change in policy. Stosie Madi ,who runs the Parker\u0027s Arms in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, said: “A 2m rule cuts our numbers by 50 per cent, it’s not fair for anyone especially not for our industry.The general public would like some guidance on what would be safe, but we know that more than 1m is going to be very bad for us, we will not be able to make a profit, keep staff or employ people if we only have a 2m rule.Heath Ball who runs the Red Lion and Sun in Highgate added that he believed the rules would become \u0027self-policing\u0027, and explained: They seem to be saying now off you go, do what you like, we want people to go back to work so we can stop paying furlough.“The onus should really be on the customer, if you are concerned then don’t go to a pub, most pubs in this country can’t afford to operate with reduced numbers. It is at their own risk.The spokesman added that all public health guidance is under constant review to ensure that it reflects the latest scientific advice.The Government\u0027s ambition is to reopen pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants from July 4 at the earliest, subject to the scientific advice at the time.On Tuesday, the Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said the Government\u0027s position was that the two-metre rule should remain in place but added that it would be kept under review.Asked whether the rule had been discussed on Tuesday, the spokesman said that Cabinet had talked about the road map that sets out the easing of lockdown measures.On Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon pledged to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland.The First Minister said: I\u0027ve not seen anything they\u0027ve had that would advise a change in the two-metre rule right now. In fact, on the contrary, most of the advice that I see says that the two-metre rule should be maintained.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 10th june 2020","story":"Workers add a protective face mask on a seven-meter-tall giraffe made of 45,000 Lego pieces prior to the reopening of the Legoland Discovery Centre, after being shut due to the covid -19  pandemic, in Berlin, GermanyComment: Is inflation the obvious solution for our post-Covid economic recovery?Prime suspect in murder of Swedish PM \u0026#39now dead\u0026#39 as case finally closedTravel updates: Covid-19 infections \u0026#39highly correlated\u0026#39 with air travelWatch: Rapper Wretch 32 posts video of police tasering his fatherCoronavirus latest news: NHS waiting lists \u0026#39to hit 10 million by end of the year\u0026#39The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCoronavirus world round-up: WHO urges Pakistan to introduce \u0026#39intermittent\u0026#39 lockdowns as cases surgeNew photograph of Prince Philip and Queen released as Duke celebrates 99th birthdayComment: Coronavirus is destroying China\u0026#39s bid for global dominationPrince Philip at 99: Even closer to the Queen than everNicola Sturgeon sticks by two-metre rule as Scottish pubs warn two-thirds will stay shutComment: Lockdown savers show how the Chancellor can get the economy moving againGeorge Floyd protests: US Navy will ban Confederate flagUS Navy will ban Confederate flag on all aircraft and submarinesArchbishop of Canterbury says Church must \u0026#39set its house in order\u0026#39 over racismUniversities told to be honest with students over how coronavirus will affect classesArchaeologists find first Elizabethan theatre in WhitechapelIslamic State-linked jihadists \u0026#39kill 59\u0026#39 in Nigeria village attackNon-essential retailers to reopen on Monday - but still no hope for hairdressersBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel updates covid 19 infections highly correlated air travel","story":"Big international aviation hubs created more exchanges and more potential for the virus to grow, a report saysComment:  It\u0027s time for the Government to be straight with us about our summer holidays Key dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?

That in turn would mean those planets would theoretically be better as a home for life elsewhere in the universe.The dust changes the climates of the planets so that they would be better able to deal with the extreme and critical conditions that are found throughout the universe.How to see Mars, Saturn and Jupiter in the night sky this weekThe discovery suggests that planets that might have been written off as homes for life, because of their conditions, might in fact be better at supporting it than scientists had previously thought.And the researchers behind the new paper, published in Nature Communications, urged those scouring the universe for such planets to ensure that they look for dust as a potentially key marker of whether a planet is habitable.Many of the planets that are found as possible homes for alien life orbit stars smaller and cooler than our sun, known as M-dwarfs, and do so in synchronised rotation-orbit states, so that it is always day on one side of the planet and night on the other. That poses a major issue for any life, since it means that each side of the planet is likely to have more extreme conditions.However, researchers found that large amounts of airborne dust could cool the hotter side, where it is always day, as well as warming the colder night side. That means that the planet\u0027s could be more easily inhabited, since there is a wider range of distance from the star where water could exist, which is thought to be one of the key tests for life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But these \u0027synchronised orbit\u0027 planets are very different, said Ian Boutle, lead author of the study and jointly from the Met Office and the University of Exeter.Here, the dark sides of these planets are in perpetual night, and the warming effect wins out, whereas on the dayside, the cooling effect wins out. The effect is to moderate the temperature extremes, thus making the planet more habitable.Even on planets that have orbits like those on Earth, airborne dust could help cool any worlds that are at the inner edge of the habitable zone, where any extra heat could mean that the surface water is lost and they become uninhabitable.The scientists, from the University of Exeter, the Met Office and the University of East Anglia, urged researchers to look for the presence of dust in the same way they search for other biomarkers that could indicate life. They also warned that the same thing keeping those worlds habitable could also stop us seeing them properly.Airborne dust is something that might keep planets habitable, but also obscures our ability to find signs of life on these planets, said Manoj Joshi from UEA. These effects need to be considered in future research.Scientists found the results by simulating Earth-sized exoplanets, using climate models that allowed them to see how naturally occuring dust would change the conditions on those worlds.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The travel industry also has some positives after a torrid six months, with one in 10 people admitting they had missed their foreign trips so much they were planning on going away more than they did last year.Of the 2,600 surveyed by OnePoll, 495 identified themselves as managers, directors, or business owners.More than half of this group said they expected their business to come out of the pandemic the same or better than it was last year.

Times have changed since Little Britain first aired so it is not currently available on BBC iPlayer.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLittle Britain has repeatedly come under fire in recent years for its reliance on blackface and yellowface for humour. Both Walliams and Lucas dressed up as black and Asian women for the series, playing characters including an overweight Caribbean woman and a mail order bride named Ting Tong.Other recurring characters have been accused of being ableist and transphobic.BBC’s Big Night In – a joy marred by Little Britain’s racist returnPiers Morgan tells ‘stupid and racist’ people to stop watching GMBIn May, a Little Britain sketch for the BBC’s Big Night In drew 180 complaints, specifically a joke in which a character said he wanted to eat a bat – itself a reference to conspiracy theories about the origins of coronavirus.In 2017, Lucas said that a Little Britain reboot would have to be radically different as it would “upset a lot of people” if it came back exactly the same. He acknowledged that the show made jokes that would no longer be acceptable.While reports in March claimed that Netflix and the BBC were in a tug of war over the mooted Little Britain revival, something teased by both Walliams and Lucas in recent months, fresh controversy over its humour may have cast doubt over its return.The ongoing international protests against systemic racism and police brutality have further shone a spotlight on racist entertainment and stars previously accused of racism.Mark Wahlberg’s history of racially motivated attacks as a teenager resurfaced after he came out in support of Black Lives Matter, while The Flash actor Hartley Sawyer was fired from the series after the unearthing of racist tweets.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need leaders like yourselves to help bridge this gap of disconnection, misinformation, and complacency.”The employees also made a list of suggestions the executives could implement:Condemn the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs on peaceful protestorsCancel Microsoft contracts with the Seattle Police Department and other law enforcement organisationsSupport defunding and demilitarisating of the police departmentSign the petition for the resignation of Mayor DurkanSupport Black Lives Matter Seattle’s List of DemandsEnsure that employees with reduced productivity because of COVID-19 will not be penalised in annual performance reviewsAlthough the original email was sent on behalf of only 20 employees, it quickly spread through the company with hundreds more asking to be included.Dozens of Zuckerberg-funded scientists attack FacebookTech giants provide ‘essential services’ to US blacklisted firms All the biggest announcements from Microsoft Build 2020“Those who choose to support the movement in ways other than boots-on-the-ground protests have also suffered the results of the SPD response,” wrote one in an email thread reportedly seen by OneZero.“Tear gas streams into apartments through cracks in the wall as far as a mile away. The sound of flashbangs and fired tear gas canisters reverberates through the night, past 2–3am most days this week, including last night. Worse yet is the fear and stress that these employees are dealing with fear that has been compounded by SPD’s ever-escalating response.”That same employee also said that they had been tear gassed three times, hit with a flashbang once, and mentioned a video that showed another company employee being put into a chokehold by Seattle police.Microsoft is not the only technology company to have employees ask for greater action from company leaders Facebook employees staged a walkout over the company’s decision not to take action against inflammatory posts made by Donald Trump about the death of George Floyd. with employees saying they are “caught in an abusive relationship” with the president.IBM today also took the decision not to develop facial recognition software following the protests, because that technology discriminates against minority faces and can be used to disproportionately target communities of colour.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kessler called Heather Hayer, the woman who died during the white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville a “fat, disgusting Communist” and called her murder “payback time”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt the time, Twitter said: “Verification was meant to authenticate identity \u0026amp voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance. We recognise that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.”The company also verified the parents of CEO Jack Dorsey, Tim and Marcia Dorsey, while the verification program was still closed.When reached for confirmation, the social media site said that Wong’s discovery was accurate but would not comment further. It is currently unclear when the company would reopen verification requests.Twitter has also been experimenting with a number of other features on its site, including the ability to let users choose who can or cannot reply to inidual tweets and asking users to “revise their language when tweeting rude or “harmful” content in an attempt to make its platform more habitable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Barclays Bank has dropped the name of a slave-owning tobacco lord from a major riverside development in Glasgow.The development on the south bank of the River Clyde will be home to the multinational bank’s new Northern European hub, as well as over 300 new flats, and has been marketed as Buchanan Wharf.But following days of Black Lives Matter protests that have erupted all over the UK and a petition signed by hundreds calling for the name to be changed, Barclays has confirmed the development will now be known as ‘Barclays Glasgow Campus’.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe name Buchanan is associated with Andrew Buchanan, one of the city’s most famous ‘tobacco lords’ and one of the first Scots to own tobacco plantations in Virginia, where he made most of his wealth.The petition against the name was signed by more than 350 people. It stated: “Glasgow should not be glorifying the horrific barbarity of the slave trade and its slave masters by naming its new city centre riverside development Buchanan Wharf.”How BLM and Bristolian vandalism renewed hope Rhodes could fallArmy ‘open’ to changing names of bases named after Confederate leadersKeir Starmer takes knee in solidarity ‘with all those opposing racism’If Priti Patel comes for the protesters, she comes for all of usWindrush drama Sitting in Limbo leaves viewers ‘seething\u0027Barclays said it made the decision to rename its new facilities in line with “consistent naming convention for our key global sites”.“We will be using the city’s historic Tradeston district in our address and we have already notified Glasgow City Council of our intention,” said a spokesperson for the bank.A spokesperson for the Drum Property Group, which is developing the site, told Glasgow Live that changing the name of a site is the “natural evolution of any development process”.The group said the development had been named after “one of Glasgow’s most well-known steamboat owners” Captain William Buchanan, not Andrew Buchanan. However, it acknowledged that people would associate the name with the latter.He said: “In the meantime, we are fully supportive of the City of Glasgow’s commitment to widen both debate and education on the matter of the city’s merchant and slavery past and look forward to participating in the forthcoming programme of consultation.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The statue of slave trader Robert Milligan, which stood outside the Museum of London Docklands, was subsequently removed.Glasgow\u0027s own ties with the transatlantic slave trade and slavery have come under scrutiny. Anti-racism campaigners last week sought to rename streets in the city centre, replacing the names of slave traders and tobacco merchants with those of slaves, black activists and black people who have died in police custody.Protesters briefly renamed Buchanan Street at George Floyd Street after the man whose death ignited protests throughout the US against police brutality and racism faced by black people.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

How Boris Johnson dropped his promise to reject US chlorinated chickenGovernment ready to open British markets to chlorinated chickenUS negotiators have made clear that opening the door to American agricultural exports, which are produced to much lower welfare standards than their European counterparts, is their primary demand in talks with the UK.While the government’s own best-case scenario shows an agreement with the US would lead to a tiny boost to the UK economy of just 0.16 per cent of GDP, failing to sign such a deal would be highly politically embarrassing for Boris Johnson, who has presented such an arrangement as part of the alternative to EU membership.Selaine Saxby, Conservative MP for North Devon, said during a question session in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon that “a large number of farmers and constituents” had contacted her concerned about food standards.“Can my right honourable friend assure me and my constituents that we will maintain our current food standards and prevent the import of chlorinated chicken and other inferior food?” she asked.Penny Mordaunt replied: “I think in this we should be trusting the consumer. If people don’t want to put their faith in government we should trust the consumer. I think consumers want high quality, fairly priced foods with high-quality animal welfare standards.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The communication, to MPs, said the UK was “firmly committed to upholding our high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards outside the EU”.But the National Farmers’ Union warned that the letter was open to interpretation and that the assurances provided “no safeguards” if “we have a concern about the animal welfare or environmental impact of a certain production method”, according to trade publication The Grocer.Downing Street signalled last Thursday that imports of lower-standard American food were now on the table in the negotiations, a reversal of a longstanding promise.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ivy McGregor, left, reads a resolution during the funeral for George Floyd at The Fountain of Praise church in Houston.

It was reported last week that the UK is going to take a “dual tariff” approach to the imports, allowing American meats in even if they do not meet some British production standards, but also charging tariffs.If US food exports do make it to the UK, British consumers may be denied information about which products are American to help them get a foothold in the market. The US government’s “Foreign Trade Barriers” document for 2019 catalogues policies in countries around the world the US wants ended. The document says the US has “consistently raised concerns” about country of origin labelling at the World Trade Organisation, notably because of “the potential to favour select countries, and the impact on US exports”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.State election officials are blaming inexperienced staff and coronavirus safety concerns for severe voting delays at Georgia’s primary election on Tuesday.Voters reported long delays and queues while waiting to cast their vote at polling stations and officials have labelled the setbacks in certain counties as the fault of staffing issues and coronavirus health concerns.“We have reports of poll workers not understanding setup or how to operate voting equipment,” Gabriel Sterling, the state’s voting implementation manager said in a statement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“While these are unfortunate, they are not issues of the equipment but a function of counties engaging in poor planning, limited training, and failures of leadership. Well over 2,000 precincts are functioning normally throughout the state of Georgia.”Voters across the state have reported malfunctions in the voting process, with some criticising the lack of effective provisions in “critical” political times.I know what happens when leaders start calling protesters ‘terrorists’Georgia official say police should ‘shoot to kill demonstratorsVoter Monica Hickman told CNN that she had to wait a substantial amount of time to vote after joining a line at about 6.45am due to the malfunction of voting machines.“It was after 7.30am when we went inside the voting area only to be told the machines were down. We had to use provisional ballots. I filled it out and left it there,” Ms Hickman said.“When it’s time to vote, everything should work properly because we’re living in critical times and this is one of the ways our voices can be heard,” she added.Another voter Dan Upshaw, spoke to CNN when he was in line to vote. He had reportedly been waiting since 8am and poll workers told him they only had one functioning voting machine.“We were told Fulton County was on site working on them,” he said. “Last official update was that there were three machines working, but voters are saying there are only two.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But every other county faced these same issues and were significantly better prepared to respond so that voters had every opportunity to vote.” There have been more than 52,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the state of Georgia as of Tuesday, and 2,200 people have died of the disease.Mr Sterling seemingly addressed his earlier statement on Twitter on Tuesday writing: “I want to make something clear...all Poll workers are doing the best they can under difficult circumstances. Every county wants to vote every voter who wants to and we are working with all counties, including Fulton to get the lines moving. Pray for all election and poll workers.”The state is also seemingly encountering strain within its absentee voting system as a result of the high volume of ballots.A source in the secretary of state’s office told CNN that some counties in the state are straining under the amount that has been received so far.The state is said to have received more than 1.2 million absentee ballots, a primary participation record, and around 1.16 million more than the state usually sees each year.Ninety-six percent of ballots that were requested had been recorded as delivered to voters as of last week, the secretary of state’s office reportedly said.Absentee mail-in ballots must be received by county elections offices by 7pm Eastern Time on Tuesday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.It has been described by one resident on social media as “like something out of a Stephen King movie”.A New Zealand suburb has emerged from the country’s coronavirus lockdown to find it has been invaded by feral chickens.Around 30 of the animals have made a home of Titirangi, a suburb of Auckland, while its 4,000 residents were staying in during the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow, locals are demanding action against the birds – which they say are damaging the area and leaving their human neighbours sleep deprived with their early morning chorus.“Some people really hate them,” said Greg Presland chair of the Waitākere Ranges community board, which has been tasked with addressing the problem.New Zealand now free of coronavirus after last known patient recoversIt is, it should be said, not an entirely new issue.A population of some 250 feral chickens had developed in Titirangi up to 2019 after a pair of domestic birds are said to have been released and “gone rogue” a decade earlier.But after local authorities managed to round all but two of the creatures and send them to nearby farms before the Covid-19 outbreak, residents assumed the problem had been sorted.Not so, it seems.The chickens have now multiplied once again during the weeks of reduced human activity.Now, he added, efforts to capture the birds will be redoubled, although some exasperated locals have suggested they should employ a local frozen chicken company to sort the problem once and for all.“The thought’s actually starting to appeal,” Mr Presland joked.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

is expected to announce that zoos and safari parks can reopen on June .There are  zoos and aquariums in the UK, which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.The Prime Minister is expected to announce todaythat zoos and safari parks in England can reopen on Monday, June , alongside non-essential shops, as long as they follow social distancing rules.Indoor zoo attractions like reptile houses are likely to remain closed and cafes will have to be take-away only.Many zoos have already implemented one-way systems, additional hand washing facilities, sanitiser stations and viewing spots painted on the ground, to encourage visitors to maintain the two-metre rule.Both Chester Zoo and London Zoo have reported financial dficulties during lockdown with the former revealing the attraction could end the year £m in debt due to the Covid- pandemic.In Scotland, Edinburgh Zoo website said they are, “closed until further notice, following “the latest government advice on coronavirus and social distancing.”It added it was struggling to survive and its food bill alone was £, per month.In May , the government revealed they would pledge £ million in support to help zoos survive.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “We understand the challenges faced by zoos and aquariums during these unprecedented times but it’s vital that we do not move too quickly in reopening to ensure public health is protected.“We have provided a £m support fund to ensure zoos are able to continue to care for their animals.Alongside this, work is ongoing to understand how and when zoos and aquariums may be able to reopen in a safe way to the public whilst maintaining social distancing.”Zoos were among the first attractions to open as European countries started to ease their lockdown restrictions.They have already been opened in Denmark and Germany and they are reopening in France, Italy, the Czech Republic and some Spanish regions too.In Belgium, the Park Pairi Daiza is opening its doors to a maximum of , visitors instead of its usual ,.While the lockdown in the UK is being lowered in dferent phases, theme parks may be the last to open.Guidelines released by the government said: You will still not be able to use areas like playgrounds, outdoor gyms or ticketed outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces.Thorpe Park, Alton Towers and Drayton Manor have all remained closed for the season, with no estimated dates of when to reopen.Richard Mancey, who chairs the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions told the  that parks need to open by July and August or face problems reopening at all.He said: If we don’t get open by the summer season, a lot will be in serious trouble, even the big parks, who have more cash reserves.”It remains unclear when theme parks such as Thorpe Park or Alton Towers will open their doors again.In an update on Thorpe Parks website in June it said: We are determined to be here for you, your friends and your families, offering other worldly thrills and helping you create fantastic memories, as we have done for decades and will continue to do for many more.In line with current Government guidance, we are hoping to be able to reopen the Resort on the th July .Those who have purchased tickets for either Thorpe Park or Alton Towers have been told they will be valid for the remainder of the  season.Thorpe Park reopened its gardens on June  in line with government guidance and is hoping to reopen the rest of the park on July .Its website states: In our th Birthday season, we are determined to be here for you and your families, offering awesome thrills and fantastic memories, as we have done for decades and will continue to do for many more.In the meantime, please keep smiling, clapping and supporting each other.Social distancing guidelines are likely to remain in some form until the virus signicantly fades.In the UK, this means staying at least two metres apart from people outside your household and avoiding physical contact.It is expected this will be enforced by staff in zoos and aquariums, in a similar way to how shops and supermarkets are supervised.Drastic changes may include having to leave the middle seat empty on rides and lowering capacity on rollercoasters and other rides.Elsewhere in Europe, other countries are beginning to reopen zoos and other leisure attractions.Austrias tourism minister Elisabeth Köstinger has revealed that hotels will be able to reopen on May , with zoos and swimming pools allowed to open from the same date.Belgium too has already reopened zoos, museums and other public spaces following Prime Minister Sophie Wilmés easing of restrictions.But in Belgium, zoos are forced to operate a one-way system and online ticketing with time slots - similar measures would probably be expected in the UK.Switzerland also reopened zoos on June .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly. Pigs also eat human flesh’.”Christian B is currently eligible for parole having served two-thirds of his sentence for drug offences - but German legal experts say it is unlikely to go through as he is under investigation for murder.Follow our live blog below for all the latest news and updates.ONE of the British women who was in a relationship with Christian B in the noughties is a mum-of-two from Berkshire. She lived in Praia da Luz when she dated convicted paedophile Brueckner in the early s.She is understood to have been questioned previously by detectives at her current home in Lagos but the nature of her evidence has not come to light until now.She has now spoken again to police re-focusing inquiries on -year-old Christian B., who is serving his prison sentence in Germany. The ex-girlfriend is not a suspect but agreed to co-operate by giving a statement.She is a friend of the other British woman, also in a relationship with Christian B. in the noughties.There is no suggestion either of the women had any clue about any involvement he might have had in the abduction of the British toddler.A PAL of Christian Bs told The Sun that the Madeleine McCann suspect#had a campervan but wasnt a hippy as has been said#.The friend, who knew the German while he was in Portugal, said: #He wasnt a bad-looking bloke and was always well groomed.#He was quite brash and loud and was also a bit of a charmer and I could see why women might be attracted to him.#But I never liked him because Im a close friend of both of the British girls he dated and they both told me he beat them up.#Theyve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and dont know what to do.#CHRISTIAN B boasted about kidnapping, raping and killing a girl with a conversation with another paedophile, it is reported.He is said to have spoken online about wanting to “catch something little and use it for days”, The Times reports.German cops investigating the disappearance of Inga Gehricke, five, # which Christian B has also been linked to # discovered the conversation.When he was asked about being caught, he reportedly said: “Meh,the evidence is destroyed . . .”He then added: “Then I’ll record maaaany videos clips. I’ll document in detail how she’s being tortured.”A FRIEND of Christian B who knew him in Portugal said people who know the suspect are #horried# and fear he had planned to abduct Madeleine.The pal, who has lived in Lagos on the Algarve for more than ten years, met Christian B when he worked at an expat bar called The Tavern.The friend told The Sun: #We knew exactly who Christian B was, even when the first pictures of him appeared online with a black bar across his face.#And now we all fear we know exactly what hes done. All the pieces of the jigsaw have fallen into place. Were horried and traumatised. It just doesnt bear thinking about.#What he said at that dinner suggests he planned the whole thing very carefully and that he might even have stolen Maddie to order. #But we also cant help feeling guilty thinking we should have pulled together all the clues years ago and gone to the police.#CHRISTIAN B could be released from prison todaya court in Kiel grants him parole, according to the prosecutor leading the Madeleine McCann investigation.He is eligible for release after serving two thirds of a -month sentence for a drug case from .Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told The Times: #The sooner we get evidence, the better for us to avoid the risk of him ever being released.“If we find nothing new against him it could be that in seven years at the latest he may be released and leaves Germany for a country that doesn’t extradite.“If we don’t solve the McCann case perhaps we can prove he committed one or two other crimes, which might be enough to keep him in prison permanently in preventive detention.”Christian B hasnt been charged over Madeleines disappearance, and cant be held in jail for it.CHRISTIAN B.s request to be released from prison was made on May  and will be decided by a regional court.Last night his lawyer Jan Christian Hochmann said: #We have decided that for the time being we are making no comment.#Meanwhile, a former friend said Christian B. had been nicknamed #The Mechanic# because he was constantly tinkering with his VW van and smelled of oil.SUSPECT Christian B has applied to be released from jail after serving  months of a -month sentence for drug trafficking.He faces a seven-year jail term after being convicted of raping a -year-old American widow in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in .But he has appealed  and under German law, the ruling is not rubber-stamped until all the appeals processes are exhausted.The -year-old is held in Kiel prison and is said to be refusing to cooperate with investigators on the Madeleine McCann case..Christian Bs mobile phone data placed him in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine vanished in , German prosecutors have said. The new suspect in the case lived in southern Portugal between  and . He also allegedly broke into holiday apartments in the area and dealt drugs to supplement his income while in the resort town. In , he broke into the apartment of an American pensioner, , wearing a mask and brutally raped her. The victim said he clearly #enjoyed torturing me.” German prosecutors are appealing to Brit tourists to help identy Christian Bs former homes so police can search for Madeleines body. Hans Christian Wolters says authorities in Germany, where the prime suspect in the childs disappearance is jailed, have evidence that the British toddler was killed in . However, police still do not have “hard evidence” to take convicted paedo Christian B to trial. Mr Wolters told Sky News: “The hard evidence we dont have, we dont have the crucial evidence of Madeleine McCanns body. #We expect that she is dead, but we dont have enough evidence that we can get a warrant for our suspect in Germany for the murder of Madeleine McCann. #At the moment we also dont have enough proof for a trial at court, but we have some evidence that the suspect has done the deed. #Thats why we need more information from people, especially places he has lived so we can target these places especially and search there for Madeleine.# Madeleine McCann was killed soon after she was abducted, the leading German prosecutor has said. Hans Christian Wolters said he feared that Madeleine was killed shortly after being taken from her familys holiday apartment in Praia da Luz. #My private opinion is that he relatively quickly killed the girl, possibly abused her and then killed her,# he told The Times.#We believe our suspect committed further crimes, especially sexual crimes, in Portugal possibly but also where in Germany.#Two British ex-girlfriends of Madeleine suspect Christian B are allegedly #terried# he will look for themhe gets out of prison. A friend of the pair told The Sun that the -year-old #was quite brash and loud and was also a bit of a charmer#.He added: #But I never liked him because Im a close friend of both of the British girls he dated and they both told me he beat them up.#Theyve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and dont know what to do.#Their first priority is to help police because they know a lot of things that probably join up a lot of the dots in the investigation.#The pal said the women want to ensure Christian, currently serving time in jail after the rape of a -year-old woman in Praia da Luz in , remains locked up.He continued: #Their main concern is making sure hes convicted and stays in prison because they know what kind of person he is.#Theyre terried he might get out one day and come for them.#The step-dad of a young girl who vanished close to where Madeleine McCann disappeared has pleaded with police to quiz Christian B over her disappearance.Joana Cipriano, then eight, went missing in  from Figueira # just miles from Praia da Luz.The young girls mum Leonor and uncle Joao were convicted of murdering the youngster and spent nearly  years behind bars.Joanas step-dad Leandro Silva has now called on German and Portuguese police to investigatethere are links between Christian B and her disappearance.He told The Mirror: #The moment I saw police had a Madeleine suspect I thought about poor Joana and how he could be involved.#The disappearance of my step-daughter is an unresolved case, whatever the authorities say.The -year-old added: #Thats why Id like a new police team to re-examine everything and seethis German man is involved.#A friend of Christian Bs British ex-girlfriend said he feels #guilty thinking we should have pulled together all the clues years ago#.In a Sun exclusive, the pal said the #pieces of the jigsaw have fallen into place.#The friend, a man in his s from North Yorkshire, described an incident at a bar in Lagos, Portugal, in , where Christian Bs British girlfriend suggested he was a dead ringer for some of the photofits of the Madeleine suspects, and jokingly asked: #You did it Christian, didnt you #The friend said today: #He blanked the question and shrugged # then added, Just dont go there.#The pal added: #It was said at a time when everyone had a theory about the Madeleine mystery and everyone had a story.#So everyone who knew him around that time kind of dismissed it.#The penny finally dropped last week when police in Germany announced they believed a criminal identied only as Christian B had links to the toddlers abduction.The friend said: #We knew exactly who Christian B was, even when the first pictures of him appeared online with a black bar across his face.#And now we all fear we know exactly what hes done.

It’s a horrible job but it’s something I have to do and it will change my le. You won’t be seeing me for a while.”Christian disappeared at the same time as Madeleine — resurfacing three years later working in a bar in Lagos, around six miles from Praia da Luz.Read the full story here.Portuguese prosecutors have confirmed Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B has two convictions in the country.It was reported last week that the -year-old had served prison sentences in Portugal, but authorities have now confirmed his criminal record.There had been no official recognition of media reports about the suspect’s criminal record in the country.Last night prosecutors took the unusual step of confirming his criminal record, saying Christian B was convicted of “disobedience” and “theft”.A spokesman for the Faro District of the Portuguese Public Prosecution Service said: “In the last few days, several news articles have been published linking the German national suspected of involvement in Madeleine McCann’s disappearance to other court cases that took place in the Faro district.“In order to clary the matter, the Public Ministry has been examining its records and has so far managed to collect the following information.“The Maddie suspect was convicted of disobedience in one case and of theft in another.“Five requests for international judicial cooperation were also found in which the name of the suspect is mentioned.“One of the requests is related to a case actioned against unknown people and closed in February , and four related to the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance.”Local media had reported that the -year-old spent two months in Evora Prison, in central Portugal, and nine months in jail in the Algarve for petrol theft in . On  May , the politan Police announced they would be reopening an investigation into Madeleines disappearance. A request for a review of the evidence came from then Home Secretary Theresa May.British polices involvement, known as Operation Grange, is led by the Specialist Crime Command Unit and directed by DCI Mark Cranwell, who has over  years experience in the force.The investigation has cost an estimated £million.In , Madeleine vanished from her bed in the McCanns holiday apartment in Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz.The ground-floor apartment was in the fth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village. At the time, Christian B, who is now German prosecutors lead suspect in the case, had been living at a run-down shack just miles away.Detectives have also focused on a small farmhouse in the hamlet of Monte Judeu, around four miles from Praia da Luz.This is where the suspect lived in the years before Madeleines disappearance.German prosecutors have said that the investigation in Christian B could be droppedthe public dont come forward with more information. Hans Christian Wolters told the BBC: #We have evidence against the accused which leads us to believe that he really killed Madeleine but this evidence is not strong enough at the moment to take him to court.#The investigator said that while the evidence is #strong enough to say that the girl is dead and strong enough to accuse a specic inidual of murder#, cops need more information from the public. He added: #One has to be honest and remain open to the possibility that our investigation could end without a charge, that it ends like the others have.#We are optimistic it will be dferent for us but for that we need more information.#It comes after Mr Wolters issued a plea for British tourists who lived in Praia da Luz between  and  to come forward.He told Sky News earlier: “We expect that she is dead, but we dont have enough evidence that we can get a warrant for our suspect in Germany for the murder of Madeleine McCann. Dutch police are working with German authorities to determine whether Christian B was behind the disappearance of a seven-year-old in .Police in The Hague said they were going to #exchange information# about the suspect with German cops, after Jaïr Soares vanished from a beach nearly  years ago.Leo Simais, from The Hagues cold case team, told Dutch paper De Telegraaf: #We would be crazywe didnt look closely at this German man.#We have now made contact with the German Criminal Investigation Service and are going to exchange information.#We are now working on a presentation about the disappearance of Jaïr, which we can then take with us#.A German police chief warned his officers to watch Christian B in , after he was released from prison for sexually abusing a child.The leading officer, from Braunschweig, where the suspect lived, reportedly told his officers #not to take eyes off him for a minute#.The now former cop told German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung: #Maybe we had the right feeling back then#.-year-old Christian B is currently serving a  month jail term for drugs trafficking. A BARMAID has recalled the moment Christian B shouted at her the child is dead when colleagues discussed Madeleine McCanns disappearance.The suspect is said to have got #very aggressive, nervous and agitated# as workers at a kiosk he ran in his hometown of Braunschweig brought up the toddler.Barmaid Lenta Johlitz, , told ITV News: #He said very loudly the child is dead! After all these years you wouldnt find such a corpse anyway.#That was the only situation where I look back and ask myself Why did he say that back then She previously revealed how Christian B #lost it# when the missing youngster was mentioned # and said it was a #good thing# she was dead.Lenta said: #He wanted us to stop. He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly. Pigs also eat human flesh’.”A HOTEL receptionist’s slip let Christian B know Madeleine McCann would be alone in her holiday flat, sources alleged.They apparently noted a block dinner booking for parents Kate and Gerry and their “Tapas Seven” pals in an open staff register at Praia da Luz’s Ocean Club.A pal of sex predator Christian B who worked at the club is suspected to have seen the entry and told him when the McCann property would be easy to raid.But Portuguese lawyers say charging the pal with being an accomplice to the abduction would fail because it would be impossible to prove he meant to assist the crime.Lawyer Rui Pedro said: “The employee in question could only face disciplinary problems. And eventhere was intent, any crime they may have committed would now be spent.”MADELEINE McCann cops have no clue where her body is buried but do know how she was killed, it is claimed.Prosecutors in Germany say they have evidence the toddler was killed after she vanished in  in Praia da Luz but not enough to charge suspect Christian B.Speaking on Good Morning Britain, German newspaper Bild editor Julian Reichelt said: #They have an idea of how Madeleine McCann died # how the killing was actually done.#They do not know where the body for example may have been buried.#THE mum of a murdered nine-year-old schoolgirl dubbed the German Maddie was wrongly suspected of being involved in her abduction.Nine-year-old Peggy Knobloch disappeared in . Cops fear Christian B could be linked to her killing. Her remains were found in .Peggys mum Susanne Knobloch has reached out to Kate and Gerry McCann, who have also been ly accused about their daughter Madeleines disappearance.She said: #As parents, one has excessive hope again of finally getting answers to all questions. and most importantly, to get your child back.After the investigation into Christian B. was announced last week, Ms Knowloch said: #This not only clears them of suspicion, but also mentally.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free. Scientists point to a possible surge in Covid cases in the North.But equally reputable experts insist there is little chance of a second wave.The risk of the NHS failing to cope has now passed.Meanwhile, lockdown has brought its own death toll. Countless lives have certainly been lost from failure to diagnose and treat cancers and heart diseases.The price in lost schooling and crippled le chances will be paid for decades to come.Lting lockdown is a tough decision for any prime minister.But, as Boris knows better than most, to lead is to choose.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing.

ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A report on the state-run Korean Central News Agencysaid that the North would shut off all communication from midday today. In the absence of formal diplomatic relations or embassies, the two countries typically communicate via a jointly-run body called the Inter-Korean Liaison Office. The office maintains a number of lines of communication, including hotlines between senior figures within the countries militaries as well as their presidential offices. The North has released a series of statements over the last week threatening to close the officethe South did not stop defectors sending anti-regime material back over the border. Defectors from North Korea are known to use a number of methods, including pamphlets dropped from small air balloons, to get information back into the country. The move is likely also part of diplomatic manoeuvring related to severe international sanctions currently in place on the North, the Times reported. The sanctions are thought to be having a devastating impact on North Koreas economy and population. Despite the decision only officially coming into force today, a spokesperson for the South Korean ministry of defence said routine daily calls made through the liaison office yesterday went unanswered. Daniel Wertz, Programme Manager at the National Committee on North Korea, tweeted that severing communications was a well-worn play for the North, but a dangerous one amid the coronavirus crisis. The spat comes after Kim Jong-un disappeared from view for almost three weeks in April, prompting speculation about his health as well as reports of his death. He reemerged at the beginning of May, and this week was seen smiling at a meeting of senior officials from the ruling Workers Party.The KNCA report stated that Kim and other senior figures in Pyongyang had decided that “the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into one against an enemy”.“[The North Korean people have] been angered by the treacherous and cunning behaviour of the South Korean authorities, with whom we will have lots of accounts to settle, it said. “We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Berman however issued a statement which accused the Prince of ly portraying himself to the public as eager and willing to co-operate. The US Department of Justice has filed a mutual legal assistance request to the Home Office - which formally asks for help to question the Royal.Andrew is facing ongoing scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Epstein, who was at the centre of a web of sex trafficking and abuse before killing himself in jail last August.The Duke has always denied any improper behaviour over his relationship with Epstein, and strongly denies allegations he slept with sex slave Virginia Roberts when she was .Sources have claimed Andrew may never cooperate with the probe while Mr Berman is in charge, reports the \" href\"https:www.telegraph news    epstein-prosecutor-has-made-impossible-prince-andrew-co-operate \" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\".

In fact, all it does is confirm what we have been dealing with here all along.Royal insiders accused Mr Berman of seeking publicity and attempting to use Andrew as a scapegoat for the failures of the case.Andrew is claimed to have been first contacted by authorities in January, despite Epstein being investigated for  years. Mr Berman previously claimed the Duke has offered zero cooperation back in January, and then said the Royal had completely shut the door on the probe in March.The source said: Every time Berman has opened his mouth, he has undermined his own case.Lawyers for the Duke of York, , have insisted he has offered to give a witness statement to investigators probing Epstein.Mr Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, has accused Andrew of repeatedly refusing to cooperate - and alleges the Dukes team unequivocally told his office in March he would not be quizzed.Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epsteins victims, told BBCs Newsnight: Justice delayed is justice denied and he needs to stop playing a cat and mouse game with the United States Department of Justice.He needs to stop delaying and trying to evade answering questions and he should not be setting any conditions,in fact thats what hes doing.It comes as William Barr, the US Attorney General, said the Duke of York will not be extradited to the US for questioning over his links into Epstein.Andrews legal firm also hit out at earlier claims from Mr Berman that there has been a wall of silence from the Duke.Blackfords LLP acting for the royal said: The Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DOJ.

The then -year-old drter told her: “I have a job to do in Praia da Luz tomorrow. It’s a horrible job but it’s something I have to do and it will change my le. You won’t be seeing me for a while.”Christian B disappeared at the same time as Madeleine — resurfacing three years later working in a bar in Lagos, around six miles from Praia da Luz.It was in the bar in  that his other British girlfriend suggested \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he was a dead ringer for some of the photofits of the Madeleine suspects — and jokingly asked: “You did it Christian, didn’t you ”A friend of the girls said today: “He blanked the question and shrugged — then added, ‘Just don’t go there’.”The pal added: “It was said at a time when everyone had a theory about the Madeleine mystery and everyone had a story.So everyone who knew him around that time kind of dismissed it.”Christian Bs cryptic comments the night before Madeleine vanished were similarly not taken seriously at the time.The friend added: “The ex-girlfriend with him at dinner didn’t compute what he’d said because she didn’t believe him capable of doing something like that — \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"even though he had been violent before.“Then Christian went off the radar the day after the abduction. Both his exes became more suspicious when he didn’tto the area for around three years.“They read about the witness accounts and realised some of the photofits and artist’s impressions struck a chord.”But the penny finally dropped last week when police in Germany announced they believed a criminal they identied only as Christian B had links to Madeleine’s abduction.The friend said: “We knew exactly who ‘Christian B’ was, even when the first pictures of him appeared online with a black bar across his face.“And now we all fear we know exactly what he’s done. All the ­pieces of the jigsaw have fallen into place. We’re horried and traumatised. It just doesn’t bear thinking about.“What he said at that dinner suggests he planned the whole thing very carefully and that he might even have stolen Madeleine to order.“But we also can’t help feeling guilty thinking we should have pulled together all the clues years ago and gone to the police.”The friend, a man in his s from North Yorkshire who has lived in Lagos for more than ten years, met Christian B when he worked at the expat bar, called The Tavern.He said: “\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Christian had a camper van but wasn’t a hippy as has been said.“He wasn’t a bad-looking bloke and was always well groomed.“He was quite brash and loud and was also a bit of a charmer and I could see why women might be attracted to him.“But I never liked him because I’m a close friend of both of the British girls he dated and they both told me he beat them up.“They’ve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and don’t know what to do.“Their first priority is to help police because they know a lot of things that probably join up a lot of the dots in the investigation.”The friend said the women are desperate to ensure Christian B, currently in jail after the rape of a -year-old woman in Praia da Luz in , remains locked up.He added: “Their main concern is making sure he’s convicted and stays in prison because they know what kind of person he is.“They’re terried he might get out one day and come for them.”One of the women is a mum of two from Berkshire. She lived in Praia da Luz when she dated convicted paedophile Christian B in the early s.She is understood to have been questioned previously by detectives at her current home in Lagos but the nature of her evidence has not come to light until now.She has now spoken again to police re-focusing inquiries on -year-old Christian B, who is serving his prison sentence in Germany. The ex-girlfriend is not a suspect but agreed to co-operate by giving a statement.She is a friend of the other British woman, also in a relationship with Christian B in the noughties.There is no suggestion either of the women had any clue about any involvement he might have had in the abduction of the British toddler.The ex-husband of one of the women, a businessman who still lives in Lagos, was also spoken to by Interpol last year as police pieced together Christian Bs history.He has refused to say what police asked or how he knew Christian B.The husband said: “We’ve decided not to talk. The police have been in touch and we’ve spoken to them. I spoke to Interpol last year.“I’m speaking on behalf of my ex too.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right.

This means heads will need twice as many classrooms and teachers to get all their pupils back in full time.Downing Street scaled back their targets after admitting many schools simply do not have the space to do this.Quizzed in the Commons, Mr Williamson said he was desperate to ensure “there is not a generation of children who miss out” in the schools shutdown.But in a hint a big dose of home-schooling is here to stay, he said a new “basic minimum curriculum” for remote teaching is being drawn up.He suggested schools may only be able toto full capacity when the protective bubble system is no longer needed. He said: “We do have limitations — where we have a limit of  children per class that obviously does limit the ability to have as many year groups in school as we like.“But as this is changed and as this is modied, this will give us the ability to slowly and cautiously move forward in terms of welcoming more children back to school when that is the right time.”Mr Williamson suggested it may take more than a year for kids to catch up on their studies. And he said the Government is working on an ambitious plan which will give children extra support. But ministers faced a furious backlash over the moves.Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield warned a massive “educational gap” is being created by keeping schools shut for many kids.She said: “Look at some of the things the Government has prioritised over recent months at vast scale and speed — the measures to save jobs, the ,-bed hospitals, propping up the economy. All of those things have happened in a way that is unimaginable. It’s that level of will and determination that’s needed.”She warned that kids’ lives risk being furloughed unless action is taken.

Pick For Britain is a national campaign, bringing workers and employers together to match skills and need to help save the farming industry.

Pick for Britain is the perfect chance to pass the summer months and earn moneyyou’re a university student, a way to continue workingyou’re on furlough and a great way to meet new people and be part of an extraordinary national effort to get seasonal food on people’s plates.

I would % recommend it to somebody . I’m having a really good time, the people are really nice, and it’s nice to be out in the open air and doing something physical. Though the work can be demanding, farm work is currently considered key work and it’s a healthy and productive way to support local communities during this dficult time. You usually need to be at least  years old to work on a farm, but there may be roles for  to -year-olds depending on the business and for most roles previous experience is not required, with training given by the farms. Ideally farms are looking for people who can work a full working week but days and hours can y by farm and according to the weather.

Last weekend Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said of the Black Lives Matter protests: “Thankfully, this is all based in response to events in America rather than here.” This betrayed an attitude of arrogance, complacency and ignorance. Of course, the brutal murder of George Floyd triggered this moment of mass protest: first in the US and then across the world. But it has only gathered the momentum in this country, because prejudice, bias and, yes, racism, exists on this side of the Atlantic, too. Labour does not support how the protesters pulled down the statue of Edward Colston, but it should have been removed democratically a long time ago. Colston, who smuggled more than , men, women and children out of Africa to be sold as slaves, does not deserve to be memorialised in Bristol.

The plan would replace the current personal allowance and help to form a “a modern safety net for all”, according to a report by the RSA think tank. It could rise to a £, universal basic income combined with other benefits, the study says,The idea is among a series of recommendations from the report, A Blueprint for Good Work, by the RSA Future Work Centre – and comes as the economy is braced for a devastating recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.Others include replacing JobCentres with Swedish-style “job security councils” to help workers in troubled sectors like retail, where roles risk being taken over by computers or robots.  It also calls for employees in major firms to have stronger voices over new technology and restructuring, through “democratic works councils”, as happens in Germany. Sick pay, holiday entitlement and pensions should be available to gig economy workers through a “portable benefits” system so they have the same access as contracted workers, the study adds. Future Work Centre head Alan Lockey said: Tackling economic insecurity is essential to securing Britain’s recovery.  “That means getting cash to people now by turning the personal allowance into a universal cash payment, targeted help for the most troubled sectors, giving workers a greater say over new tech, stronger unions, and a new welfare settlement for gig economy workers. “The conversation about how we build a better future beyond the pandemic must begin now – we already know the furlough scheme will end in October. “The crisis can lead to positive change, but we need to be bold.” The report also calls for government, opposition parties, employers and unions, to forge a new “social contract”. Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said: Now, more than ever, we need a vision for a new social contract, built around social justice, good work, and security for all.

He will also announce the easing of restrictions on outdoor attractions where people remain in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas, because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, despite schools remaining shuttered to many pupils. A Downing Street official said: People are continuing to make huge sacrices to reduce the spread of coronavirus and avoid a second spike, but we know it is tough and where we can safely open up more attractions, and it is supported by the science, we will do so. This is by necessity a careful process, but we hope the reopening of safari parks and zoos will help provide families with more options to spend time outdoors while supporting the industry caring for these incredible animals. The announcement will come after London Zoo and other institutions across the nation warned they may face permanent closurethey were not allowed to reopen. The PMaposs father, Stanley Johnson, had joined calls for zoos to reopen as soon as possible after they were ordered to close when the lockdown was imposed on March . Though the easing will be a relief, zoos will be told that they must not reopen indoor exhibitions, such as reptile houses, and must ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. The relaxation comes as the Government faces criticism over its handling of schools after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson conceded English primaries will not be able to welcome back all pupils before the summer holidays as planned. Children in nursery, Reception, Year  and Year  in England began ing to primary school last week but some schools have said they do not have the space to admit all pupils while following Government advice to limit class sizes to .  Mr Williamsonaposs concession will mean many primary school children will notto classes until September, along with most students in secondary school. Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums, said: Biaza is obviously delighted that zoos and safari parks have been given the flexibility to reopen. But as a sector, we are not out of the woods. Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit. For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isnapost going to be financially viable for them.

He said urgent efforts must be made by police forces to quell any potential unrest in the neighbourhoods they serve. The member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessub-committee on behaviour said mass job losses and rising unemployment due to coronavirus, as well as concerns about racial and economic inequality, may all be factors which could fuel confrontations in the coming months. A possible ide between poorer and more affluent areas brought on by local lockdowns -brought into force - could also have an effect, the professor of social psychology at Keele University, who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, warned. Speaking in a personal capacity during an interview with the PA news agency, he said: If the police donapost invest in building positive police-community relations now, there is a potential for serious and large public disorder to emerge this summer. I think in the worst case scenario itaposs not inconceivable that we could have disorder on a scale equivalent to August . What we need to do is to make sure we start addressing the underlying causes now, so that the conditions that led to the  riots are not in place should we get a precipitating incident. Put simply, the most effective thing that the police can do is put bobbies on the beat. Circumstances in the UK will change quite considerably in the coming months as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Prof Stott said, adding: There are important issues about inequality that could,not dealt with properly, feed into a situation in the future over the summer months where confrontations develop.  Localised lockdowns could become very, very problematic for police officersthe rules mean people living in poorer areas are more likely to face tougher restrictions than those in affluent neighbourhoods, he said. Enforcement generally has become pretty impossible now to a large extent as lockdown measures are eased, apart from for large-scale public gatherings, the professor said. The danger, he warned, is some of the gatherings are probably very likely to be groups of young men on working class estates which could then attract more police attention, adding: I think that could create a circumstance when lots of young men feel itaposs unfair about whataposs happening to them. And where the police try to enforce that unfairness, it could create a breakdown in social cohesion, lead to a sense of unfairness in policing. We know that those factors are often drivers for social conflict. Growing concerns about the disproportionate use of Tasers against black people and those with mental health problems raised by the police watchdog last month as it investigated a series of incidents could also run the risk of becoming a trigger for unrest, Prof Stott said. A rise in Covid- transmission rates forcing the country back into lockdown again when people are signicantly economically disadvantaged could also increase dissent about the conditions of peopleaposs lives, he added.Asked whether the allegations over the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser Dominic Cummings breaching lockdown could contribute to unrest, Prof Stott said: We are at a really, really pivotal time and the loss of trust and confidence that has been brought about by the Cummings affair has not assisted in maintaining that adherence, I think thataposs quite clear."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus updates live uk pandemic","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE: Boris Johnson to announce next steps to ease lockdown todayOutdoor attractions including zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to open at the same time as non-essential shops in the latest easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday, June ShareByAbigail OLearyTalia ShadwellReporterUpdated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video non-essential-shops-reopen-monday-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Celebrities, health chiefs, trade unions and religious leaders will mark a national moment in the fight against the pandemic. The public can light a candle in their window during a minute’s silence for all those killed by Covid-. The next day will feature a “clap of thanks” before neighbours raise a glass or cuppa outside their homes. It is backed by figures including astronaut Tim Peake, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens and ex-England footballer Gary Lineker.In a joint letter published today dozens of iniduals and groups have backed making Sunday July  a day to bring people together. The idea comes from the newly founded Together coalition, which includes the CBI, trades unions, the Scouts and Guides. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “ My sincere hope is this weekend will serve as a powerful moment of remembrance, thanks and connection, as we come together and commit to helping to create kinder, closer more connected communities.”  Others supporters include UK Sport, Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas and Baroness Doreen Lawrence. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, said: “As we mark the NHS’s birthday we want to say a huge thank you on behalf of the whole NHS to all those who have played their part in tackling this horrible coronavirus pandemic.” Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: “Throughout its history the NHS has brought the whole country together, treating everyone based on need not ability to pay.So we’re honoured the Together coalition have chosen the NHS birthday to pull the country together.”  Polling for the Together coalition found % of the public believe the coronavirus crisis has brought us closer together. Just % disagreed. Kwame Kwei-Armah, director of the Young Vic, said: “At a time when there is so much emphasis on what ides us, giving thanks and connecting with our communities is one of the things that unites us.” The minute’s silence will take place on July  followed by the clap on July .Details of the times will be revealed in the coming weeks.  Ms Plas, who launched Clap for Carers, wrote: For the last  weeks millions of people came out to clap those who went to work so we could safely stay indoors. Now is the time to expand this gratitude and acknowledge everyone who has – and still is – helping us through this crisis. Thursday nights were a moment to show our appreciation but also became a moment to check in with our neighbours and have human contact.

Rebecca Harper, , and Sam Harper, , from Fulham, escaped to the woodland tree house in the grounds of Samaposs dadaposs and step-mumaposs house in East Harptree in mid-March, just over a week before lockdown was announced. The couple, who have lived in the capital for a decade and work as chartered surveyors, initially planned to stay at the tree house for a couple of weeks but are still there over three months later after lockdown lasted longer than they expected. And they admit friends have been astounded by their sudden change of lestyle, with Rebecca, who now passes the days tending to their vegetable patch, confessing she struggled to keep a houseplant alive back in London. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  She said: Our le here is the complete opposite of what it was like back in London. I wake up to natural light and spend my days tending to the vegetable patch then fill any spare time doing watercolour paintings and calligraphy. Itaposs idyllic here and Iaposm happier than ever.  In London, we led such busy lives. We were at workout classes or the gym first thing in the morning, then it was a -minute commute into central London and out for dinner with friends until pm or pm at night. Iaposve always been creative, but thereaposs much more time to pursue my hobbies now. I finally have time to do painting and Iaposve taken up knitting. Around dinner, weaposll go for walks in the surrounding countryside - itaposs so beautul.  Rebecca and Sam made the two-and-a-half-hour drive from their home to the tree house on March , just over a week before lockdown began on March .The ft high tree house is usually rented out as a luxury holiday home by Samaposs dad, Alan Harper, and step-mum Angela Harper, but coronavirus has forced them to temporarily cease letting the property to holidaymakers. Instead, Rebecca and Sam have been enjoying relaxing in the  sq ft woodland retreat, which is fitted-out with a log burner, dishwasher and William Holland copper bathtub and have been sharing their enviable lockdown le on their Instagram page @TreeHouseDiaries. And since moving to their tree house retreat, the couple have been joined by a third member of the family, nine-week-old Labrador puppy, Duke, who will accompany them when theyto London. Sam said: My favourite thing about being here is the simplicity of le and being able to switch off and relax. Thereaposs a sense of freedom here that you donapost get in London.  It has made us appreciate the things that we would pass every day in London, but not notice because we were too busy or distracted by something  going on. Rebecca added: It hasnapost been lonely. Lots of my friends canapost comprehend that we havenapost felt lonely or isolated, but it has brought us closer together. Weaposve been growing cucumber, radish and strawberries among other vegetables. We had our first harvest in the last week.  Back in London I canapost even keep a house plant alive. It has been such a transformation. With lockdown now easing the couple plan on remaining living in the tree house until the end of June, before ing to the hustle and bustle of the capital. The tree house will then open to visitors again provided lockdown restrictions remain ease and will soon be available to book through Canopy  Stars - a travel agency specialising in luxury camping. However, they say their time in the countryside has made them reassess their priorities and for Rebecca, their three months in the woods has brought back fond memories of growing up in the Warwickshire countryside. She said: Itaposs a bit like ing to my childhood being here. The last time I grew a runner bean was with my dad when I was young. Staying here has made us question what we have in London. Weaposll probably stay living in London, but we definitely want more nature around us in the future.

After a bungled escape attempt, Power admitted to aggravated vehicle taking, criminal damage and handling stolen goods.This incident led to an unusual exchange with a top judge, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, in which she insisted Heaposs a good kid to me. He got involved with the wrong crowd. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. The media couldnapost name Power in  because at the time he was only  and subject to reporting restrictions. He was back in court yesterday for dangerous driving on a scrambler bike - described by a prosecutor as one of the worst examples heaposd ever seen. Because he has now turned , the yobaposs identity and the litany of crimes he has already committed can be revealed. Power, of Wilburn Street, Walton, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court via video link from HMP Altcourse, where he is being held on remand. Police caught him riding a stolen KTM motorbike on streets including Elderdale Road in Anfield, at around pm, on May  this year. He admitted dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a licence before city magistrates on May . Power was accused of being part of a gang who robbed the £, bike from a man at his home in Rockfield Road, Anfield on January . However, Iain Criddle, prosecuting, explained this charge was discontinued, because the complainant was unwilling to cooperate. Judge Gary Woodhall said: The defendant is named by the complainant as being one of the group who attacked him, is he not  Mr Criddle said the man said the proceedings were affecting his health and he didnapost wish to attend court. He said the case was carefully considered by a senior Crown Prosecution Service lawyer, who decided not to proceed. Judge Woodhall said it was a very serious allegation involving group violence, and confirmed Power was riding the same bike. He said: Heaposs riding the bike stolen in a robbery, in which the complainant has named him as the offender taking it, and thataposs not been pursued  Judge Woodhall asked why the man had not been summoned to appear, but Mr Criddle said he indicated he still wouldnapost attend. He said: The principal consideration was the indication that heaposs given, that the thought of attending at court and having the case hanging over him was having a very negative impact on his health and well being, and he just wanted the hearing stopped. Judge Woodhall said it was the prosecutionaposs decision and he had no power to force the CPS to review it. However, he said the CPS had a public interest duty to ensure where necessary reluctant witnesses do cooperate. Michael OaposBrien, defending, accepted Poweraposs criminal record did not paint a happy picture. He said: Your honour I simply state that heaposs just turned  years of age and for no other reason the court may be assisted by a pre-sentence report, but his record may indicate that may not be helpful here - I ask simply because of his age. I observe heaposs pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity - those are probably the only two features of mitigation open to this defendant.  Mr Criddle said police had not yet provided CCTV footage, but a description of Poweraposs riding was absolutely appalling. He said: Itaposs one of the worst pieces of riding of a motorcycle Iaposve come across in my career. Mr Criddle said the Crown was awaiting the results of a drug test, to see whether Power had cannabis in his system. He said: The officers were satisfied he did smell of cannabis and he appeared to be under the influence of some sort of substance because of his demeanour. Judge Woodhall adjourned sentencing until June  to obtain the CCTV and for the report to be made. He told Power: Understand this, Iaposm not directing the preparation of a pre-sentence report to consider direct alternatives to custody. Iaposm directing that report because of your age, so the court has the fullest information possible about you. Given your previous convictions, the breaches of previous court orders and given the nature of the driving that appears to be described in the papers placed before me today, you should be expecting on the next occasion a custodial sentence - the court will be determining on the next occasion how long that should be. Power has already served  days in custody for failing to attend three Probation Service appointments last June. That was after he was released from a young offenders institution having served half of a sentence for burglary, possessing a lock kne and possessing cannabis.

Agents have paid “increasing interest” in Epstein’s links to the UK after claims by two of his victims that girls were trafficked to and from here. Other than the Duke of York, Epstein’s alleged “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell, , and two other British women are believed to have potentially helpful information. A source said claims included “he was flying girls from the UK for him to abuse, as well as Virginia Giuffre’s allegation she was trafficked to London for sex”.Giuffre has claimed in US court she was flown across the world by Epstein, including once, in March , to have sex in London with the prince, who has vehemently denied her allegation.  Epstein victim Maria Farmer claimed he flew “at least two” girls to the US on his private jet, helped by a British woman she calls a “key co-­conspirator”. Epstein, , committed suicide in jail in August. He was being held on suspicion of trafficking underage girls for sex. Andrew, , is said have had the least interaction with Epstein compared to the three women who spent years around the convicted sex offender.The source said: “Due to the embarrassment felt among law enforcement over how Epstein escaped justice for so long, no stone is being unturned.”Previously it was reported, the FBI is investigating Maxwell and several other people linked to the financier. Sources claim the principal focus of the probe is the British socialite and other “people who facilitated” Epstein’s allegedly illegal behaviour. Maxwell, who has not been seen in public for several years, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.She has been accused in several civil cases in the US of acting as Epstein’s “madam”, which she has denied. The two other women are viewed purely as witnesses and both live in the UK.  The US Department of Justice has filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government. It is a bid to force the prince to supply a statement. An MLA allows co-operation between countries when evidence needs to be gathered in a criminal investigation.

Almost certainly wearing a jacket and tie or naval unorm, and always two paces behind his we, the Duke of Edinburgh was once lovingly described by the monarch as her “strength and stay”. As he celebrates his th birthday, they will no doubt reflect on times past as they have lunch together at Windsor Castle.The couple have been staying at the Queen’s favourite residence with a reduced household of around  staff, dubbed Operation HMS Bubble, throughout the coronavirus outbreak.To mark his birthday, Buckingham Palace has released a commemorative photo of the couple taken last week at the castle in Berkshire. The duke, in a military Household Division tie and double-breasted jacket, stood beside the head of state wearing an Angela Kelly dress with the Cullinan V diamond brooch first worn by Queen Mary. Philip has spent much of his retirement at his cottage, Wood Farm, on the Sandringham estate, more than  miles away from the Queen, , who was usually at Buckingham Palace or Windsor. But they took the decision to reunite for the duration of the Covid- outbreak. Sources have often remarked that the success of the Queen and Philip’s marriage has been put down to their dfering personalities. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said: “This must be the longest they’ve been under the same roof for many years, I would say.  “Perhaps it’s always been a case of absence makes the heart grow fonder. They would go through periods of not seeing much of each other, but it’s an opportunity in their later years to reconnect. It is the perfect royal cocooning... “The Queen is much less confrontational so I suppose they are opposites in many ways but clearly the chemistry has worked as they are now in the rd year of marriage.” They wed in Westminster Abbey in . Philip, born into the Greek and Danish royal families, gave up a promising military career to be by the Queen’s side as she was crowned in  aged .  The duke was the family’s disciplinarian while also maintaining many pursuits such as carriage riding which he has still enjoyed in recent years. Palace sources say the duke is “back to full health” after being in hospital in December for treatment of a “pre-existing condition”.

But there have been a few occasions where his humour has got him into trouble with the Queen - including a time when he decided to play a prank on her involving one of her beloved corgis. According to an insider, the Duke was feeling mischievous when the couple hosted a dinner party at Buckingham Palace, so decided to hide one of the dogs in a cupboard. When the Queen ed to the room, she asked where the dog had gone, to which he replied that he didnapost know. But his prank backfired when the dog started barking and the Queen found it - and she wasnapost happy.

Joana Cipriano, eight, was reported missing in  from Figueira – five miles from the Praia da Luz apartment on the Algarve where Madeleine vanished as her parents ate with friends nearby. Her mum Leonor Cipriano and uncle Joao Cipriano were convicted of murdering the youngster, whose body has never been found, and spent nearly two decades behind bars. But the pair insist they are innocent and Leonor claimed she was tortured by Portuguese detectives into confessing to the killing her daughter.  Joana’s step-dad Leandro Silva has now called on German and Portuguese police to investigatethere are any links between pervert Brueckner and the child’s disappearance after he became the latest suspect in Madeleine’s case. The -year-old said: “The moment I saw police had a Madeleine suspect I thought about poor Joana and how he could be involved. “The disappearance of my step-daughter is an ­unresolved case, whatever the authorities say.  “Her body has never been found and I know Leonor would never have hurt Joana. She was a good mum. “I think the police handled the investigation so badly. “That’s why I’d like a new police team to re-examine everything and seethis German man is involved. “Brueckner also seems to have been heavily into drugs and I think there’s a good chance he could be implicated.  “He appears to have done some horrible things here and he obviously knew the Algarve well. “Christian Brueckner is a person who should be questioned. There are still so many unanswered questions hanging over Joana’s ­disappearance and he could hold the key to solving them. Dad-of-three Leandro, from Portimao, told how he “shares the pain” ­Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry have felt since their daughter vanished aged three in . German police claim they have evidence she is dead.  Leandro added: “For me there were a lot of similarities with the two ­disappearances. I dream of knowing what happened to poor Joana just like I know the McCanns do [about ­Madeleine]. If that means finding out they are dead so be it but I obviously wish for a dferent ending. “What I do want is justice done for whoever’s taken her and I don’t feel asI have all or any of the answers.” Joana vanished after leaving a local cafe with milk and a tin of tuna she had just bought. Her murder investigation was led by Goncalo Amaral, the police chief who led the botched probe into ­Madeleine’s disappearance. He was found to have falsied police ­documents in the Cipriano case and was jailed for  months. Leonor launched a campaign to find her daughter before being made a suspect by Amaral, in the same way doctors Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics, were. Detectives claimed Joao killed Joana after she allegedly caught him having incestuous sex with her mum. Leonor confessed to police over the alleged murder but today insists she is ­innocent. Joao confessed to cutting Joana’s body into pieces and feeding them to pigs. However, he also now claims he had no involvement and said he too was “forced” to confess. Leonor ­withdrew her confession the day after signing it, alleging she was beaten during a two-day ­interrogation.

The government has announced that primary schools will not be reopening to more year groups before the summer - but this is a problem to parents whose furlough is coming to an end. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was quizzed in Parliament about what support exists for working parents yesterday. Some parents have been told that future leave will have to be unpaid - which isnapost an option for most families, the Manchester Evening News reports. Questioning Mr Williamson in the Commons yesterday, MP Ben Bradley said: Could I just ask him to layout for the parents of those children who now wonapost be going back until September, exactly what their childcare options currently are to enable them to get back to work  The Education Secretary said: We are working to devise a priority list so that schools are able to - where they do have extra capacity - to be able to welcome back more children into those schools so that theyaposre able to support their learning but also their communities and including their parents who of course do need to be going out to work as well.

At the beginning of lockdown back in March, schools closed to all but vulnerable children and the children of key workers.Only one parent in a household needs to be  a key worker  in order for the child to be offered a school place.The list is already pretty extensive and includes the likes of health and social care workers, those working in education and childcare, utilities, transport and the sale and production of food.

I thought when they came out they would be respected and done in quick time, so people can see they are making the force more fair, he said.  It was not done in quick time, it’s not been done, I don’t know when it will be done – we should not be talking about it  years later. They have fallen way, way short. Twenty-one years short. There is no one policing the recommendations now. The police cannot be relied on to reform. They are a group of people who do not believe they should be told what to do.

And so we want to have a home-going celebration, we want to remember his name.It was the worst thing I ever could have imagined, watching him going from speaking and breathing to turning blue, said Godfrey Johnson, , as he arrived at the church. Mr Johnson attended Floydaposs high school and played football with him. Thousands of mourners paid their respects to him on Monday, filing past his open coffin. Some bowed their heads, others made the sign of the cross or raised a fist.

Only specialised microorganisms can survive the pressure, darkness and almost freezing temperatures. Once back on board their support vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, the pair called a group of astronauts aboard the International Space Station, around  miles above the Earth. “As we glided along the ocean floor, it reminded me of video clips from astronauts flying over the lunar surface. ‘Moonscape’ was the word that kept coming back to me – like I was seeing the moon right here on our own planet,” she said. “As a hybrid oceanographer and astronaut, this was an extraordinary day, a once in a letime day, seeing the moonscape of the Challenger Deep and then comparing notes with my colleagues on the ISS about our remarkable reusable inner-space outer-spacecraft.” The ISS orbits in zero pressure while Limiting Factor tackles the equivalent of , tonnes of pressure.

David Pinney, who worked with the pair last year, says they knew each other well, and said Chauvinaposs behaviour toward Mr Floyd was hostile even back then. Chauvin is charged with second degree murder and manslaughter after he was filmed kneeling on Mr Floydaposs neck before he died. Mr Floyd repeatedly told the officer he couldnapost breathe in the harrowing footage. Both men worked as security guards at El Nuevo Rodeo in Minneapolis. David Pinney, who also worked there, told CBS News that they had bumped heads when they worked together. He said: It has a lot to do with Derek being extremely aggressive within the club with some of the patrons, which was an issue. The killing, which happened on May , has sparked protests around the world, with Mr Floydaposs family calling for the sacked police officer to face a first-degree murder charge. They believe that Chauvin, , had a personal grudge against Mr Floyd, . Mr Pinney said the two men knew each other pretty well and Chauvin would likely have known who Mr Floyd was when he arrested him. Club owner Maya Santamaria previously told CBS that the police officer was afraid and intimidated by black people. She said: He sometimes had a real short fuse and he seemed afraid.  When there was an altercation he always resorted to pulling out his mace and pepper spraying everybody right away, evenI felt it was unwarranted. Chauvin appeared virtually at the Public Safety Facility in Minneapolis on Monday, where Judge Jeannice Reding granted a prosecution motion to set unconditional bail at . millionor  millionwith conditions.

The short clip was filmed on a tour of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, when visitors must not have believed their luck when the van was able to get within inches of two lions. With the big cats seemingly happy to mind their own business as people inside the vehicle capture the moment on cameras, footage shows one man sitting within touching distance of the lions with the window wide open. The temptation proves to be too much for one fellow passenger, who then leans across him to reach out of the window and stroke the lionaposs back. At first, the male lion doesnapost seem to react as the man sitting closest pulls out his camera for another snap, but the mood quickly changes as the lion slowly turns its head to growl. Panicked voices can be heard telling him to close the window as he nervously reaches to slide it back across. Before he can, the intimidating lion roars angrily into the vehicle as he abandons his attempts and the camera ducks down behind one of the seats.  The lion is then shown to be on its feet staring at the tourists as the man scrambles to shut the flimsy window for protection.It was shared on YouTube by Maasai Sightings with the title aposStill the dumbest tourist ever apos and the description reads: A tourist in Serengeti decided to touch a male lion and almost got her face ripped off. This is a very dumb thing to do and you can easily get yourself killed or banned from a national park by doing this."},{"url":null,"title":"heavily pregnant woman who went","story":"NewsHeavily-pregnant woman who went missing found hanged in field with stab woundTshegofatso Pule, , went missing on Thursday and was reportedly last seen at her boyfriends house in Johannesburg, South Africa, but she was found dead four days laterShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  JUN NewsTshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was found hanged from a tree \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of

of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST tonight .According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three orfour days."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

I despise both slavery, and the fact that it happened. We cannot however rewrite history.Our efforts now should be aimed at ceasing the ious forms of slavery still with us, rather than toppling a statue into Bristol Harbour.Gordon Casely, Crathes.HOW we cheered when the Berlin Wall was dismantled by the citizens of that city. How we applauded when the statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled from its plinth by residents of Baghdad. How sad then that some politicians have concentrated on the negative, when the good people of Bristol finally got rid of a statue in that city, erected in the memory of a slave trader. We can only be liberated from the chains of the past, when the glorication of past evil comes to an end.It may be that few memorials to the past would pass a test of modernday morality, but as with Covid-, hindsight is a marvellous thing.GR Weir, Ochiltree.IT is high time this country recognised its contribution to the American slave trade and that the entire country benefited financially, one way or the other, from this appalling industry ndash be it employment or the buildings donated by those who made money from this industry.Tearing down statues, be it Edward Colston or others who \"financially benefitted\", does not obliterate that terrible stain on our history.I suggest that the authorities remove all similar monuments and gt them to museums with the implicit instruction that they create an appropriate place where we can all, every one of us, quietly reflect on the sins of our forebears and register our disgust that this was done in our name.Nothing can change Britains history but recognising and accepting its contribution to that appalling industry might start to correct an appalling wrong.Alan McKinney, Edinburgh EH.SOME months ago I wrote to suggest that an appropriate monument or statue be erected in the Merchant Cityto commemorate the Unknown Slave. Perhaps this might now be an appropriate time to consider that proposal again.I do wonder, however,the recent \"renaming\" of Cochrane Street might have been an error.As most will realise, Glasgowrsquos street plan recognises many of the events and personalities involved in the Napoleonic Wars.Is it possible that Cochrane Street recognises one of Scotlandrsquos most iconic military figures from that era Admiral Cochraneis still revered in much of South America for his later role in ending European colonialism on that continent.If this is the case, it would be a shame to lose that link to a man who made, within the context of the era in which he lived, a positive and sometimes radical contribution to the World as we now know it.In the meantime, maybe the establishment of the memorial to the Unknown Slave might be just the beginning of this generation of the city recognising and understanding the dark role that the horric and inhuman institution of human slavery has had and still has on Glasgowrsquos growth and success.Ian Graham, Erskine.I WAS saddened to see the word \"racist\" being used in connection with Scotlandrsquos police force.It made me think: who are our police officers They are our neighbours, our friends, our families, the people we socialise with. In short they are a reflection of our Scottish society.So is Scotland racist I imagine there is not a country in the world that is free of racism and as such Scotland equally has its problems. However, Scotland is also a very welcoming country and over the years we have seen people from many erse countries come and make their homes here. My own ancestry is with the Irish migration which arrived here in the mid th century. Growing up in the west of Scotland  years later was not always the easiest thing to do.We are a erse country but not as erse as many. Many of the aspects of our lives are still not reflective of that ersity. These include politics, government, the police, the fire service, sport and on and on. Governments of every colour have sought to address that problem and although progress has been made, there is still a long way to go.So back to my original point about racism in the police. That is no more true than recognising that there is racism in Scotland.In recognising that, we must work towards education and the emphasis on the very real positives that ersity offers.George Kay, Burntisland.BLACK Lives Matter protests, many of which have not limited numbers enough to make social distancing possible, are likely to cost many times more lives ndash and mostly black ones ndash than all the killings of black people by police in the last  years. How is spreading a virus, so it kills thousands more people before effective treatments or a vaccine have been found, valuing anyonersquos le While there is certainly still lots of racism on both sides of the Atlantic, those who say ldquothey would never have done that to a white guy are wrong. Only eight per cent of the people who die in police custody in the UK are black. Almost half of people shot dead by police in the US are white.Yes, more black people are killed relative to their percentage of the population crime is commoner, and racism. But there are cases of US police murdering white people almost identical to George Floydrsquos. Tony Timpa, a schizophrenic white man phoned  asking for help because hersquod come off his medication. Police arrived, forced him face down, and knelt, laughing, on his neck and back, as he said ldquoyoursquore going to kill me, for  minutes till he died. Charges brought against the three police were dropped despite video evidence.Daniel Shaver, also white, was unarmed in a hallway, with video of a police officer alternately shouting ldquoget on the floor, hands down and ldquohands in the air then shooting him dead. The officer was found not guilty of murder, and given a , annual pension for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder .Black Lives Matter protesters could get much wider support by creating a movement against police brutality and impunity against all victims, of whatever skin colour. And the assumption that police are always ldquothe good guys which allows the worst to get off with murder.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.REFERENCE to the demonstrators on Glasgow Green and attempts at social distancing recalled a little of why I am proud to be a Glaswegian. On the other hand, television pictures of thugs throwing bicycles, bricks and fireworks at the police made me reflect on history and how easy it is to point the finger at dubious norms in the past whilst refusing to accept that we today are forming the history of tomorrow.Our concern at the pollution of the planet seems to have been overcome by our desire to get on a plane for a holiday, instead of taking the opportunity to make signicant changes. Our rightful concern to tackle the apparent health disadvantage of black people to Covid-, doesnt seem to stretch to the disadvantaged in the east end of our cities, where an address means a restricted choice of job applications and a lower expectation of le.If we really care and want to avoid future criticism, then surely, we must speak out against our actions by default in Yemen and Syria we must accept a lowering of our living standards to ensure others enjoy our benefits and surely we must consider repaying an equivalent to the ill-gained fortune on which many of our cities were built accepting a standstill in economic progress until the Third World catches up, and abandon the fashion business, social media and \"keeping up with the Joneses\" until a more equitable society is achieved.Japan after the tsunami was a great example where  per cent voted to abolish the nuclear power programme and go back to other means of production, until prices went up and % then voted to bring back nuclear power. There is an old saying about putting your money where your mouth is.James Watson, Dunbar.I ALONG with many others, no doubt, am incandescent that the marches which took place over the weekend were allowed to go ahead.What was the Government thinking of  This makes it clearer than ever that there is one law for the majority and another for a vocerous minority. We are all horried at the death of George Floyd but this is no way to honour him or support the Black Lives Matter movement. Why have those participating in country-wide marches been allowed to put the safety of the rest of the population at risk at a time we are assured when we are still in danger from the virus If there is a second wave of the virus I will have no dficulty in knowing who to blame ndash the marchers. How dare they at a time of national crisis Let us also remember that the situation in the United States regarding the status of black people is very dferent from that in the UK. There is a dferent history there no matter what the British involvement in slavery in the past.

In one, an enslaved man is whipped by another man wearing a turban - an attempt at whitewashing the extent of Scotlands involvement while pointing a bloody finger at middle eastern and north African slave traders.The propagandist statue was built to distance Glasgow from its slaving past - here was a Scot who not only discovered the continent but saved Africans through Christianity in the process, so the story goes. Except, he had a \"tour guide\" says Ms Njenga, who cleared the explorers path through the undergrowth, as seen on the statue. \"He discovered nothing.\"Its vital to be clear-eyed about this history, she says. There lies real threat in \"the lingering stereotypes that the conditions of slavery were better than living in Africa\".In the th century, Scotland saw the grotesque wealth England was amassing as a result of the triangular slave trade - enslaved people exchanged for goods then sold into servitude and their crops ed to be traded.Scots were so well regarded for their cruelty they were in high demand to run plantations where the average survival rate for enslaved people was three to five years, they were worked so hard.The proximity of tobacco merchants Andrew Buchanan and Richard Oswalds graves to the Cathedral - one directly outside the entrance, the other in the nave - show exactly how much clout they held in the city. These men, and the others like them, wielded political power, Buchanan as Lord Provost and Oswald, as one of the brokers of s Treaty of Paris.:Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealed - find your addressDespite media publications at the time of Abolition in  professing that \"not one brick of Glasgow\" was built on the broken backs of enslaved people, the history books beg to dfer.A sum of pound million, or pound billion in todayrsquos money, was paid to the slavers - despite their offensive wealth - to compensate for lost trade. A tax only paid off in  by all of us.Ms Blake says she balks when she hears the citys slogan, Let Glasgow Flourish.She said: \"Let Glasgow flourish on the children thrown as bait to the crocodiles, on the women being raped and torn away from their breastfeeding children. When people say there were not involved, they were involved. They were involved up to their neck.\"It was not only the wealthy merchants the streets are named after, Ingram, Glassford, Buchanan and Dundas, who were culpable, but the Glaswegians who worked in administrative roles and processed the tobacco and sugar that passed through.: Boris Johnson does not believe UK is lsquoracist countryrsquoThe city had a \"disproportionate\" involvement with the slave economies, despite its calculated cover up.The Stirling family who held the estates of Keir, near Dunblane and Cadder, in the north of Glasgow hastily changed their family crest post abolition, removing the silhouette of a Black mans head signying their trade and replacing it with a gleaming white swan, as can be seen in the stained glass windows of the Cathedral.The main thoroughfares built by merchants so they could have comfortable passage from their palatial homes to the counting rooms that totted up their wealth, the parks built as play areas for their wives and children and the commercial buildings rising from the piles of bodies of enslaved Africans are all a legacy of Glasgow, and Scotlands, heavy involvement in the slave trade.It is a history that needs to be remembered, argue Ms Blake and Ms Njenga. Particularly in a cultural climate that is leaning to the right and elevating politicians and commentators that trade in racism, hatred and misogyny.Ms Blake said: \"Slavery is not in the past because even today people are benefitting from it.\"If this history was known a lot of stereotypes would not be as strong. These stereotypes are harmful to everybody\"After visiting the site of the Tontine Heads, where sugar was traded, the Old College, Glasgow Universitys first incarnation, and the Merchant City area, the tour comes to a close outside the Gallery of Modern Art, built as an extension to sugar and tobacco trader William Cunninghames mansion.Ms Njenga said: \"Glasgow used to be  streets but because of the wealth of the slave traders it expanded.

The anti-racist protesters we have seen in our cities over the last few days are misguided in my eyes as they only see black and white in the issue instead of the big picture, including the brother of racism ndash sectarianism. If the recent anti-racist actions of defacing history continue, then in  yearsrsquo time, slavery- deniers will emerge and say that black people made it all up.I feel that the demonstrators did not stop to understand that racism is only one facet of the issue of discrimination in the human psyche which is embedded in people early on in le so that they visualize the world and its people in binary form ndash us and them. It is perhaps a primal form of defence we are unable to shake off even after local tribalism and clan culture disappeared. Not only people are black and white but we talk daily about issues being ldquoblack and white, meaning there must be absoluteness in truths in our lives.We regularly hope that a rounded schooling will enlighten young people yet we condone our polarising education system which is too often about black and white right answer and wrong answer success and failure winners and losers top of the class and bottom of the class a hit or a miss.

Many have reacted in support of the protests which have taken place in support of Black Lives Matter throughout the world. The fact that a minority resorted to violence only served to distract from the force of the protests.I wrote some months ago to make the point thatwe seek to revisit history in such a fashion and to apply todays moral standards, then why stop at slavery  Yes, it is true that figures such as Stirling and Cochrane in Glasgow made fortunes using slave labour. However, many other prominent figures in Glasgow made their fortunes during the Industrial Revolution on the backs of their workers, who toiled in dire conditions without proper wages and who lived in squalid and over-crowded housing. Let the whole story of exploitation be remembered.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.DISTASTEFUL as slavery in British plantations was, history cannot be changed. Just as it should not be forgotten, there is no case for the febrile revisionism currently being preached. If we truly learn from history we should perhaps be more circumspect about trading with countries where slavery is still a fact of le.

However, when emotion is unleashed in the actions of looting, violence and the destruction of statues, the rule of law and the primacy of reason are replaced by an ungovernable populist vigilantism.If society is to regain its stability, all must accept that emotion must not overpower the central pivot reason plays in the governance of the state.Righteous indignation should not be reflected through major civil disturbances but should harness the process of law to right the wrongs prevalent in the distortion of perspective created by misguided historical precedent, motivated by self-interest.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.Read more: Letters: We canrsquot rewrite history, but we can make the present better"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-needs-called-account-profligate-spending","story":"How much is that per person  Where exactly does it go  These funds come from taxpayers, either iniduals or corporations throughout the entire UK, but the SNP has successfully broken the link between services and taxation in Scotland now. There are many people who believe that most of their services, support, and medication are delivered at no cost, magically appearing from the ether like manna from heaven.They are not costings are just pushed along vertically or horizontally. There are economic, social and environmental limits to everything, except in Scotland apparently.Surely such profligate spending in Scotland by the SNP needs more attention at the moment, not just to refute the SNPrsquos vision of a \"milk and honey\" independent Scotland but for taxpayers across the UK.David Bone, Girvan.MAY I answer the question put by Liz Galbraithregarding how an independent Scotland would pay for the current crisis An independent Scotland with its own National Bank would do exactly as all other independent countries have done and are doing ndash borrow from their own National Bank, a debt incurred which would never need repaid, as they own that bank. It is simply a strategy for printing money and increasing the supply within the economy, and that is exactly what Westminster is doing.As things stand, as part of the UK, Scotland is not allowed to borrow a single penny from anyone, nor is it allowed to overspend its budget. In fact, it is legally obliged not to spend all its budget, but must end every financial year with a surplus. It is therefore prevented by our membership of the UK from dealing with this crisis as all independent countries around the world are able to. The value of oil, or anything , is totally irrelevant.P Davidson, Falkirk.I NOTE the letter from Liz Galbraith in respect of dferences between New Zealand and Scotland and \"extreme financial challenges\". I quickly checked a few things and found that GDP per capita in both countries are broadly similar, that Scotland has slightly more people, New Zealand has more land. So how will New Zealand handle those challenges given that they are not any wealthier than Scotland I submit the dference in performance is a combination of constitutional dferences and powers with, perhaps, the luck to have an exceptional leader at the time of crisis. Of course, Scotland may also have had an exceptional leader in Nicola Sturgeon, but without the kind of constitutional powers that Jacinda Ardern has, we may never know.Iain Cope, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrand others are indulging in a fallacy in their assertions that \" Scotland was independent...\" with regard to the current Covid- pandemic. There is no comparison to be made between Scotland and New Zealand, not least because the latter is an archipelago so biologically remote from the rest of the world and anomalous that it had no terrestrial mammals at all until the Polynesians arrived in the th century.What is more, Scotland voted to stay in the UK in . The choice of two million Scots was the preference for the risks and responsibilities of being part of bigger and more erse country and economy over those of being part of a smaller and narrower one. If we want to play Ms Marrs parlour game and pretend that something  happened, we can also imagine the penury that Scotland would have faced following the greatest economic shock in its history, and wonder how on earth we would have managed with public services stripped of over pound billion every year.Such speculation is all very entertaining, and makes useful material for the attempts of nationalists to distract us from the failings of the SNP Scottish Government. But Scotland is not New Zealand. Nor Norway nor Denmark nor the Republic of Ireland. Nor in terms of responsibility for public health and the NHS and care homes, is it even England.In the real world, we can only judge Nicola Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman and co by the actions and decisions they have taken, and have failed to take, and above all by the Covid- infection rate and death toll in Scotland.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Food stocks are good, helped by food coming in from both the Scottish government through the council hub and from the national support effort organised by Tesco.“These two sources have really helped to boost our normal regular food donations coming in through local shops.“Where necessary we have also been able to buy in additional food and toiletries using the funds which we have received from many dferent sources.”SIC education and families committee chairman George Smith said the figures were “concerning” and urged anyone who thought they may be entitled to free school meals to make the necessary enquiries.Mr Smith said: “It’s obviously concerning and disappointing that there is an increased demand on the foodbank particularly from families.George Smith: #There are probably people accessing the foodbank who have never had to do so in the past#“There are probably people accessing the foodbank that have never had to do so in the past.“I would encourage anybody entitled to free school meals to be making sure they make that application“We are paying £ a day, and that goes into the bank account.”Mr Smith’s comments came as the Scottish government highlighted additional support it was providing from its £ million Food Fund.FareShare, a national network of charitable food distributors, has distributed over , tonnes of food – the equivalent of almost . million meals – since rd March, supported by £, of Scottish government funding.Now, an additional £. million of funding will help FareShare purchase more food for local authorities, community-run initiatives and frontline charities across Scotland.Mr Grieve said: “This is very welcome news as Shetland has been benefiting from the government’s support following the announcement of the initial £, funding and I fully expect that the need for this support will remain for many months to come, even when the pandemic is fully controlled.“The Trussell Trust announced today that nationally there has been an  per cent increase in demand for support during April compared with  and more alarmingly there was a  per cent rise in support for children.”Scottish communities minister Aileen Campbell said: “At this dficult time, it is more important than ever that we tackle food insecurity by supporting the work of community food distribution groups across the country who are best placed to ensure vital supplies reach those who need it most.“By working in partnership with FareShare and their partners in communities across Scotland, this extra funding will help frontline charities and community food groups provide support to even more people in need.” raquoWe were told there was no magic money tree.

Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower and the American Bar in Belfast, said the lack of guidelines makes it dficult to plan ahead, other than knowing staff will have to keep their hands clean and sanitised, and that there will be social distancing.As far as putting structures up, including screens, we are not going to do that unless we know we need to, said Mr Donald.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePedro Donald of Sunflower Bar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPedro Donald of Sunflower BarHe added: We will not be doing sessions initially as they would need to be spread out and space is going to be a premium. The hospitality industry has warned that pubs and restaurants may be unable to reopenthe two metre social distancing rule is not reduced. The two metre rule will not work inside Mr Donald#s bars, both of which are small two-floor spaces, although the Sunflower also has a popular large outdoor area. If that rule remains in place, he said would be able to host about four people.Mr Donald said he will not be inviting or encouraging crowds to come to his premises, but he is not sure whether there will be a big rush to the pub. A lot of people might see how it is working, while others will want to go right back, he said. The Belfast bar owner expects to have the same number of staff, with less behind the bar but more on the door and policing the toilets.Willie Jack, owner of the Harp Bar, the Dark Horse and the Duke Of York, among other establishments, believes it makes sense for bars north and south to open at the same time, rather than potentially see pubs in Londonderry and Bundoran working on a dferent schedule.He believes Monday, July  is a sensible date as it would be better not to open on a pay day at the end of the month, a weekend, or a holiday like the Twelfth. A wet Monday or Tuesday night when there is no pressure, he said.The publican expects no standing or sitting at the bar, and customers being served at certain points then ing to their table. He noted that certain countries and the World Health Organisation have endorsed the one-metre rule.There will be no live music in his venues initially, then possibly single singer songwriters. Mr Jack expects capacity to be reduced to between  and % depending on what rules are put in place by the Executive.Prices might have to go up, he said, adding that he does not want to see customers partitioned by screens.A number of his establishments are in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast, and he wants to work with the City Council to pedestrianise the area in the evening and at weekends. Managing taxi ranks and portable toilets will be vitalthat happens, Mr Jack added. Otherwise, staff are likely to be washing hands every half hour, using sanitiser but not wearing gloves or masks, the publicans said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the two-metre rule and said businesses may have to rely on their ingenuity to operate within the restriction. He said the rule was under review, but, ultimately, it isn#t the rule that#s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way, it#s the virus. And in the Republic, Business Minister Heather Humphreys said yesterday that the two-metre rule may be changed provided that coronavirus figures go in the right direction and the transmission rate remains low.

We can start preparing them for that reality.He added: On the Northern Ireland protocol, there are businesses reporting to me that they are now moving jobs to the Republic.South Belfast SDLP MP Claire Hanna drew Ms Mordaunt#s attention to last week#s Assembly vote calling for an extension to the Brexit transition period.She said: The Government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to.If the Northern Ireland Assembly#s consent is so vital, should the Government not listen to what it says Ms Mordaunt said that although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years# time, the Government would not be extending the transition period.She added that trade talks with Brussels are at a key stage and need to be escalated in the coming weeks.She repeatedly ruled out extending the transition period beyond December this year and pressed the need for the UK to be treated as a sovereign equal.Mr Smith said many businesses haven#t realised the consequences of coming out of the single market and customs union.

The Foyle MLA asked the Minister for the Economy whether she will give a commitment to the appointment of representatives from the north west to her reformed economic advisory group to assist the group in developing policies to redress existing economic imbalances. In her response, Dianne Dodds could not give that commitment. She said the Economic Advisory Group isbeing re-established to assist her in developing a new economic strategy and to provide ongoing advice on how to grow the economy. googletag.cmd.push She added that members will be appointed on the basis of their knowledge, experience and expertise, and will be expected to act andadviseon the wider Northern Ireland economy interests rather than their own sectoral or geographical interests. Sinead McLaughlin was disappointed with that response, she said: “Northern Ireland has serious inequalities and removing these must be a priority for the Department for the Economy and its minister. So I am very disappointed that the minister has rejected my requests for this to be a core part of the remit for her Economic Advisory Group and for that group to contain representatives from the North West, who could provide specialist expertise and understanding of these inequalities. googletag.cmd.push “It is unacceptable that for years, indeed decades, that Derry and the North West suffer the highest levels of unemployment and the hidden unemployment that is called economic inactivity. This must be addressed and it is astonishing to find that we are still hearing arguments that the wider economic interests of Northern Ireland are being considered without addressing the very serious problems of high unemployment and poverty that exists in the North West. “I hope that despite the minister’s response that the Economic Advisory Group will make it a priority to consider how to ensure that the parts of Northern Ireland with the highest unemployment and poverty are supported to achieve the highest levels of growth and recovery. We know from experience that in recessions it is the areas with the weakest economies that usually suffer the most. “There must be additional investment in skills and infrastructure to support the North West achieve a proper economic recovery. The Economic Advisory Group must have the courage and independence to say that and as a core part of their work to identy the sectors which offer the best prospects for increased employment, productivity and growth. It is unacceptable for Derry, Strabane and the rest of the North West to be simply told to put up with more of the same.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Opening the book in Causeway Coast and Glens was outgoing mayor Sean Bateson’s final act as he relinquished the role at Monday night’s AGM. Chair of Mid Ulster Council, Cathal Mallaghan, said the book was available for anyone who ‘feels something’ in the wake of Floyd’s death. “Racism is a real virus that lives in our communities and we should be doing everything we can to stamp it out,” he said. “Normally, books of condolence would be open across our normal arts centres, but because of the Covid- restrictions, we will do it online. googletag.cmd.push “I encourage everybody who feels something about this tragic case to get online and use this as a tool to express how you feel.” The death of George Floyd has sparked anti-racism protests across the globe, with protests held locally in Belfast and Derry over the weekend. The books of condolence can be signed online via the Mid Ulster and Causeway Coast and Glens websites. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band. The compere was Joseph Caher.Woodgrange Platoon Home Guard presented The Lilac Ribbon by Downpatrick born playwright Lynn Doyle in the Woodgrange Orange Hall on Friday, January , .The Whip Hand was performed by the Stella Maris Players in the Parochial Hall, Saul, on Sunday, May , .The Bryansford Players staged The Rale True Doctor and Professor Tim in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Bryansford, on Sunday, April , , and in St Maryrsquos Hall, Newcastle, on Sunday and Monday, April  and .The Pikemen Orsquo the Ards, described as ldquothe grand Irish drama in five acts, was presented in Dunsford Hall on Sunday, April , , by the Cruachan Cowey Dramatic Club, with Irish selections by the Silver Star Band, Portaferry.With television, the internet and computer games there appears to be less interest today in local drama groups.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

The centre is also coordinating the creation of a VisitDownpatrick website, he remarked.Dr Campbell said St Patrick provided a ldquounique selling point for our area and and an overall brand.He added: ldquoAs this is potentially a year of two winters, we have asked the council to revert to their  contributions to the centre to help us survive and be able to change direction.ldquoThis means giving the centre a little more, particularly because as a small charity in a big building we have not been able to get any of the funding from government made available to other groups and organisations.ldquoIf tourism, as the most important part of our economy in mid Down is to not just survive but thrive we need to be armed with not just a shield, but a sword to fight this battle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Climbing to top of Mount Everest  ","story":"MOUNT Everest, , feet, or , metres, of awe-inspiring, dficult, adventurous, dangerous climbing. Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her.

They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

But, despite, a large amount of public land and pathways available to link these community assets, these attractions are poorly connected.Mr Hazzard said he has asked the local authority to ldquourgently look at rediscovering the public value of disused railway lines, abandoned riverside paths and overgrown public spaces in developing a Downpatrick greenway project that would help breath new le into redundant community infrastructure.ldquoLinking these wonderful local attractions would also help create exciting new public spaces where people can relax, enjoy nature or exercise, he continued.ldquoDelivering a greenway initiative would not only represent an exciting investment in our local tourism offering, but help create multiple, long-term employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, providing a strong  to build a much-needed, vibrant weekend and evening economy in the town centre.Mr Hazzard believes that developing greenways has the potential to make a huge dference to the lives of local people by providing the opportunity to enjoy traffic free access to fresh air and exercise.He is also confident that the initiative would encourage more workers and children to commute to work and school on foot or by bicycle and help provide a vital leisure resource for local people and visitors alike for generations to come. ldquoThe Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions has exposed the importance of community trails and public spaces to our collective well-being as a society, Mr Hazzard continued.ldquoOver recent weeks, our country roads and parks have been full of people seeking respite from isolation in the green, community infrastructure that ordinarily binds our communities together.However, it is clear that this infrastructure lags well behind many comparative regional, national and international locations.ldquoThankfully, however, unlike most major infrastructure projects which can be quite expensive and take the best part of a decade to complete, community green infrastructure can be delivered much quicker and at much less of a cost to the public purse.Mr Hazzard says he is confident that a new greenway project in Downpatrick represents an ldquoexciting opportunity on so many levels and deserves serious consideration.He added: ldquoI look forward to discussing this proposal with senior council management in the weeks ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18480443.lasting-impact-bergmans-the-seventh-seal/resources/images/11442227.jpg","title":"stay safe meeting group latest lockdown rules","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that in EnglandIn ScotlandIn WalesAnd in Northern IrelandEstablish ground rulesKeep everything outdoors where possibleKeep your distanceAvoid sharingMasks, wipes and sanitiserThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That name, of a fine police force that was respected in policing circles internationally by the time it was disbanded, had to be ditched, to placate nationalists. Then the injustice of - recruitment was introduced, in which less qualied and less suited candidates from Catholic backgrounds for officer positions in the force were preferred for admission over better candidates from Protestant and other backgrounds . This persisted until Catholic levels of recruitment reached a certain level. Yet this is not now enough for nationalism. As the Catholic percentage of recruits slides, there is a fresh clamour to introduce positive discrimination, aslower Catholic levels are always the fault of everyone . \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But not only that, now there is push to re-brand the PSNI to downplay the Northern Ireland element. Remember that this comes at a time in which republicans have been getting civil servants to use the phrase north of Ireland in documents.Such terminology de-legitimises the fact of Northern Ireland, which exists under the principle of consent in the  Belfast Agreement — yet those who roll their eyes and insist that terminology does not matter typically depict themselves as defenders of that deal.The PSNI insist that they are not trying sideline the Northern Ireland part of their name. So why are they doing it The chief constable Simon Byrne’s answer is not impressive. He says that the new logo, which bafflingly makes the Cross of St Patrick colourless and thus immediately un-recognisable, and which gets rid of the word Northern Ireland on the lower part of the crest, will “better reflect the breadth and depth of what we do and to improve our connection to our communities”.There is no need for this change. In fact we need a better explanation from the PSNI how such a plan has got far.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They decided they would do a Zoom competition instead and we thought it would be great to enter some of our teams in a way to keep spirits high, keep training, keep motivated and most importantly - have some fun.“We have been doing weekly Zoom rehearsals every Tuesday with the mini, junior and intermediate competition teams, which has been amazing. I have been brought to tears on many occasions by seeing their beautul, smiling faces that I miss so much.“As the restrictions started to relax - where you could meet six people outdoors - some of the dancers have started to meet up outside for their Tuesday Zoom classes, which has been really special for them. I still haven’t seen any of them in person yet but am very excited to.”Victoria revealed that a productive collaboration with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and the Riverside Theatre was key to making the event happen.The Ulster Dance Championships Zoom competition will feature Victoria Lagan dancers on Friday“I spoke to a member of the Council during a weekly FaceTime meeting I have with them regarding re-opening the studio and discussed the idea of us being able to do our Zoom competition together outdoors and they went through some of the legalities around it,” she said.“Once I realised this could be an option I contacted Roseanne Sturgeon, Manager of the Riverside Theatre, who was over the moon with the idea. She then had Megan Sheeran, who is the Technical Coordinator at the Riverside, to contact me to go through possibilities.“Megan has been such a huge help with this and has really gone above and beyond the call of duty in helping me do all the risk assessments so we could put it forward to be approved by Ulster University, Coleraine.“Thank goodness the Uni said yes! So we will be meeting on Friday outside at the back of Riverside - weather permitting - to compete in the Ulster Dance Championships via Zoom.”Victoria Lagan dancers will perform live on Zoom on FridayDancers and parents will have to adhere to a number of strict regulations to make sure the event passes off safely.Each dancer must use personal hand santisers, bring their own labelled water bottle, practice social distancing and have no physical contact at any time with other competitors or equipment.There will be security on site to check names of the children participating and only one parent per child will be allowed to spectate.First aid and fire marsahals will also be present and there will also be a special isolation room in the theatre should anyone develop symptoms.Markings on the grass outside the theatre will assist social distancing and no toilets will be in operation.Victoria added that anyone ignoring the safety measures will be asked to leave the site immediately.“It’s a lot of rules and regulations but we are eager to follow them and make this work so that we can give these kids a great day,” she added.“Our dancers are known for being well disciplined and I have the utmost faith that they will follow all regulations. Dancing means the world to these girls and I know how grateful they are to everyone at Riverside for allowing them to perform.“It’s going to be an amazing day!

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
