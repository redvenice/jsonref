I love listening to her, pretending her teddies and dolls are competing in the Olympics, or that they’re all working in a cotton mill — she loves history and learning about monarchies from around the world.Now six, she’s in year two at Catholic primary school, a year ahead of where she should be.Most important, she’s got lots of friends and is a happy, sociable and kind little girl who loves helping others and just happens to be academically gifted.  Other people think I\u0027m a pushy parent          Alannah has an IQ of 140 and in February became the second-youngest member of MensaNadine George, 37, is a part- time business analyst. Husband Edmund, 39, is a management consultant, and they have two children Alannah, four, and Ethan, two. The family lives in Buckinghamshire. Alannah has an IQ of 140 and in February became the second-youngest member of Mensa. Nadine says:Alannah lives and breathes sums and letters and would rather watch Endless Numbers, a children’s educational series, on YouTube than Peppa Pig.She could recite the alphabet at 18 months old and by her second birthday she had taught herself to read. At first, I just assumed she’d got an outstanding memory or was simply ahead for her age.However, I started to monitor her milestones more closely — the average ages at which children learn basic sums, counting, and reading — and realised the gaps between her and her peers was widening.So in January, we had her assessed by top educational psychologist Dr Peter Congdon.He used the Wechsler Preschool And Primary Scale Of Intelligence, which involves several tests including spelling, mental arithmetic and puzzles, spread over two hours.He concluded that Alannah is ‘intellectually gifted and of superior general intelligence’ with an IQ of 140.         Four-year-old Alannah George, the youngest member of Mensa, is pictured with her mother Nadine, father Edmond and little brother Ethan Of course it made us proud, but most important, it’s helped us to understand how Alannah ticks.We know her strengths — such as arithmetic — and areas we need to play closer attention to, for example keeping her inquisitive mind challenged.Learning is her idea of fun and she loves her school, St George’s School at Windsor Castle, once attended by Princess Eugenie and Prince Edward’s two children. The teachers are very good at adjusting her learning to keep her challenged and engaged.There are downsides to having such a bright child. Some people assume we’re pushy parents and others accuse me of bragging. But you can’t teach an IQ — it reflects learning capacity and potential, not achievement.In fact, my parenting style is very laid back and one reason I’m speaking out is to help other mums who recognise traits of a high IQ in their own children because it’s a real worry when you don’t know where to turn.My husband and I are academic — I have a chemistry degree from Imperial College, London, and he has a PhD in biochemical engineering from UCL — but we weren’t sure how to best help Alannah, which is where Mensa comes in.When Alannah’s not reading or doing sums, she’s a regular four-year-old girl and her friends don’t see her as being any different."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/22/22/video-12587676-150_154x115.jpg","title":"Tom Ford snaps famed Manhattan party pad no one purchased eight years","story":"Share this article \u0027There was no railing on the stairs at the house,\u0027 said Frowick. \u0027And when you got up to the mezzanine, there was a little shelf where people could sit.

Photograph: Carl O’BrienPrimary school teachers are calling for leave to be available to them if they suffer a miscarriage.Reproductive-health related issues such as miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and fertility treatment are not included under the current sick leave scheme for public sector workers.Josephine Byrne, a teacher based in Edenderry, Co Offaly said she felt compelled to go back to work after a miscarriage despite feeling “broken”.“In the middle of June our world came crashing down around us. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I started to bleed. A trip to the early pregnancy unit in Ballinasloe confirmed our worst fears: the baby had stopped developing at seven weeks and I’d had what is termed a missed miscarriage,” she said.She was among teachers to tell their highly-personal stories on reproductive health at the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s (INTO) annual congress in Galway.‘I was broken’Ms Byrne said she received a very sympathetic response from her principal who was “beyond supportive” and urged her to take as much time off as she needed.However, after being at home for a few days waiting for things to progress, she began to worry about using up her sick leave.This was because pregnancy-related sick certificates can currently only be issued by GPs for issues arising in later pregnancy.“Instead of minding myself and grieving with my husband over our lost child, I was stressing about using up all of my sick leave,” she said.After she underwent a hospital procedure on a Friday, she returned to work the following Monday.“At the time we were living an hour away from school and I cried the whole hour-long journey from Edenderry. I wasn’t ready to go back to school. I was broken.”While Ms Byrne became pregnant again, she found out she had a second miscarriage at the end of the following August.“I was devastated and barely functioning but guess what I did on September 1st? Yes, I went to school. Why did I do that? Because I was worried about using up even more sick leave. The worry and stress over sick leave was like a noose around my neck at the time,” she said.Ms Byrne said separate reproductive health leave is needed to those recovering from miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies and fertility treatment,“Fertility treatment, scans for possible difficulties, difficulties with IVF should all be covered,”she said.“A lot of teachers still feel slightly uncomfortable about speaking to a principal about such issues,” she said, and a certificate would “respect this privacy”.IVFAt the union’s annual congress on Tuesday, members backed a motion calling for statutory time off work for reproductive health matters.It is first public service union to seek such statutory leave for reproductive health matters.Ms Byrne said that she had subsequently become pregnant, and gave birth to twins six months ago.“I know that I am now one of the lucky ones. We need to support others to end the stress that many of our colleagues go through when using sick leave for reproductive health matters,” she said.She said IVF was only going to become a “bigger issue”, and she welcomed the fact that the INTO had “opened up the conversation on this”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869556.1556039818!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"funicular and driverless shuttle in proposed phoenix park revamp","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access. Photograph: Pat LanganDublin’s Phoenix Park is facing its most significant change in decades, with plans for new visitor attractions including a funicular, a driverless shuttle-bus, and a train station, proposed by the Office of Public Works (OPW).The OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access.It also wants to reduce the dominance of car traffic in the park which is “not appropriate, nor indeed safe” and has a “significant negative impact on the amenity value of the park”, but it is careful not to propose curbs.The Phoenix Park Visitor Experience Strategic Review, which is open for public consultation until Friday, April 26th, ides the park into five different areas.The entrance at Parkgate Street is described as the “welcome quarter” the area around the zoo and Ashtown Demesne as “activity quarter” while the west end near Farmleigh has been termed as the “bioersity quarter”.Meanwhlie, the Magazine Fort in the south of the park is branded as the “commemorative quarter” while Chesterfield Avenue, the long straight road bisecting the park has been called the “central line”.Two “welcome pavilions” have been proposed for the Parkgate Street entrance to serve as visitor information centres and “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle” the OPW said.The main visitor centre would be at the Ashtown Demesne, where the current cafe could be redeveloped as a children’s education centre, and a larger cafe, toilet facilities and visitor centre would be built, as well as the possibility for extensive “discrete” car parking facilities.The zoo entrance facilities could also be expanded, and the tea rooms and bandstand near the zoo could be upgraded. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line which runs from Heuston Station could also be located to the east of the zoo.The bioersity quarter, which takes in Fury Glen and the White Fields at the west end of the park would see the least intervention, but there could be scope for development of the existing pavilion near the Knockmaroon gate as a bioersity centre. It could be “tripled in size” without being over developed the OPW said. Toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised barbecue” space could be located here. Barbecues are currently banned in the park.The biggest changes are likely to be seen in the commemorative quarter focused on the Magazine Fort. This old military structure could be refurbished with exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, but could also incorporate a funicular which would run to the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge on the other side of the river Liffey.The central spine of Chesterfield Avenue could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions. However its principal function would be to act as a public transport route to discourage people from taking cars into the park. The OPW proposes a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. Such a system which was “almost science fiction a relatively short time ago has now become a readily achievable reality” it said.While the OPW does suggest new parking areas, it is keen to reduce through traffic and “tame” the use of the park for commuter parking it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869599.1556055196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"family of lyra mckee pay tribute to gentle innocent soul","story":"Friends of murdered journalist Lyra McKee have stamped red handprints on the wall of a dissident republican office in Derry in protest at her killing.

Photograph: Dave Meehan The family of murdered journalist Lyra McKee have paid tribute to her, saying she was “a gentle innocent soul who wouldn’t wish ill on anyone”.Ms McKee (29) died as a result of injuries sustained when she was shot on the Creggan estate in Derry on April 18th.The statement was issued on the eve of her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday which will be attended by President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at St Anne’s Cathedral. The family asked “that Lyra’s life and her personal philosophy are used as an example to us all as we face this tragedy together. Lyra’s answer would have been simple, the only way to overcome hatred and intolerance is with love, understanding and kindness”. It asked everyone who knew her to “continue her message of positivity and hope, by respecting her memory with dignity and respect. We as a family know that the whole community has been touched by the events of Thursday night and that many are rightly angry. “On Thursday April 18th our beautiful Lyra was taken from us. A daughter, a sister, an aunt, a great-aunt, a partner, a niece, a cousin, and above all, a best friend and confidante to so many of us,” the statement said.“A friend to all, a gentle innocent soul who wouldn’t wish ill on anyone. Such a warm and innocent heart, she was the greatest listener, someone who had time for everyone. “She was a smart, strong-minded woman who believed in passionately in inclusivity, justice and truth. Lyra spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background, those of all political views and those with none. This openness, and her desire to bring people together, made her totally apolitical.” The statement, issued through Kinnear \u0026amp Co solicitors, thanked “everyone for the outpouring of support and love we have witnessed this past few days. It has been of immense solace that Lyra meant so much to so many.” The family requested privacy. ‘No accident’ Earlier on Wednesday evening, Britain’s secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley has rejected apologies for the killing of journalist Lyra McKee, saying her murder was “no accident”.Speaking in the House of Commons Ms Bradley said: “To those responsible for this act of terrorism, we say we have heard your excuses and your hollow apologies. No one buys it.“This was no accident. There is nothing that can justify this murderous act and you are being called out for what you really are.”The New IRA admitted responsibility for the death of McKee in Derry. In a statement given to The Irish News using a recognised code word, the group offered “full and sincere apologies” to her family and friends.The New IRA is an amalgam of armed groups opposed to the peace process and it recently claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to London and Glasgow in March.Police believe the violence was orchestrated in response to an earlier search by officers aimed at averting imminent trouble associated with this week’s anniversary of the Easter Rising.The statement said: “On Thursday night following an incursion on the Creggan by heavily armed British crown forces which provoked rioting, the IRA deployed our volunteers to engage.“We have instructed our volunteers to take the utmost care in future when engaging the enemy, and put in place measures to help ensure this.“In the course of attacking the enemy Lyra McKee was tragically killed while standing beside enemy forces.“The IRA offer our full and sincere apologies to the partner, family and friends of Lyra McKee for her death.” House of Commons Ms Bradley said the “voices of peace” are “louder than those who peddle hate and ision in a city with so much to offer.” Ms Bradley added: “There is definitely a sense on the ground that this is the end. People don’t want to see this happen again.“Those communities that have been oppressed by the terrorists, oppressed by the dissidents, made to live on estates in a way they don’t want to, live in those estates and not be part of that, are standing up and saying no, not in my name.”She added: “None of us can escape the symbolism of this, that it was Good Friday. It was a woman, a journalist, an innocent who was shot dead by terrorists. That is something that none of us can escape.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said Ms McKee, “not the gunmen who mowed her down”, truly represented the city.He said: “It is important we do remember the brightness of Lyra’s life, and we said this was a life well lived. A young woman who most certainly was a child of the peace agreement.“A young woman that lived her life in the way she chose to live it and campaigned for the things she believed in. And we should remember that bright spark, not simply to remember the way in which that spark left the world.” Meanwhile a vigil was held opposite the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin city centre on Tuesday evening. It was organised by the National Union of Journalists. On Tuesday evening, the PSNI said it released unconditionally, a a 57-year-old woman arrested earlier today over the killing. Detectives from the PSNI Major Investigation Team continue to appeal for help from the local community in Creggan or anyone with information.Three people have now been arrested in connection with Ms McKee’s death. Two iniduals who had been detained were released without charge.Stormont impasseMeanwhile Tánaiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney travelled to Northern Ireland to discuss the current impasse in Stormont in light of the death the journalist. Sinn Féin leader in the North Michelle O’Neill was seen arriving for the meeting late on Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman for the Alliance Party told the Press Association: “Simon Coveney and Naomi Long have had a phone call this morning and will be speaking again later today.“We are aware the Tánaiste is travelling to Belfast for a series of private meetings.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869699.1556053107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"once conjoined twins eye paralympian glory in the future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScreenshot from the video sent by Tom Hanks to the twins. Hassan and Hussein Benhaffaf who were born conjoined twins intend to become Paralympians.They were separated successfully in 2010 at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and have endured 53 surgeries to date. The Cork nine-year-olds made international headlines after Hollywood actor Tom Hanks sent them a personalised Toy Story video. Speaking to Cork’s 96FM Opinion Line, the boys’ mother, Angie Benhaffaf, said they were uncharacteristically dumbstruck when they first saw the Hanks video . “I watched it first because the twins were still asleep. I completely teared up. Once the boys woke up and were sitting to have breakfast I put it on. Its very rarely that Hassan and Hussein are dumbfounded. “They were speechless at first. Then in the middle of it they started giggling. Hassan kept saying, ‘is that the real Woody?’ It was pretty amazing,” she said.The twins are energetic and love sports, including wall climbing.“Every opportunity they have they amaze me. They are fantastic at their sports they want to be paralympians. They are mad training at their athletics. They do wheelchair basketball. They do swimming with their scoliosis group. They do this on one leg!” she said.The Hollywood movie has played a great part in their lives.“On one occasion Hussein was pretty scared going for surgery without Hassan. Hassan gave him a loan of his Buzz toy to get him through it. The pair love dressing up as Buzz and Woody. However, as they get older they are finding it increasingly difficult to source costumes big enough for them,” she said.The boys are set to receive their personalised Woody toys and letter from Tom Hanks later this week.

Photograph: Andy RainTheresa May’s government and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party have blamed one another for a lack of progress on talks aimed at finding a common position on Brexit. The prime minister told her cabinet that Labour was dragging its feet and did not share the government’s sense of urgency about the negotiations.“The PM said discussions with Labour had been serious but had also been difficult in some areas, such as in relation to the timetable for the negotiations. The PM said the government’s position was that progress needed to be made urgently as it was vital to deliver on the result of the referendum and for the UK to leave the European Union as soon as possible,” Mrs May’s official spokesman said.Whitehall sources said that, while the government was eager to win parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal in time to avoid contesting European Parliament elections on May 23rd, Labour was more relaxed about taking part in them. Opinion polls point to a collapse in the Conservative vote next month as pro-Brexit voters flock to Nigel Farage’s newly formed Brexit Party but Labour’s vote appears to be holding up.Mr Corbyn blamed the government for the slow pace of the talks, saying the Conservatives had come up with no new ideas to break the deadlock.‘Window of opportunity’“We will continue putting our case but quite honestly there has got to be a change in the government’s approach. They cannot keep on just regurgitating what has already been emphatically rejected three times by parliament. There has got to be a change. We have a window of opportunity to bring about that change. I hope the government recognises that . . . and makes the most of it,” he said.The talks are expected to continue this week and possibly into next week and Whitehall sources suggested the government could introduce the withdrawal agreement Bill next week while negotiations with Labour continue. The Bill, which would enshrine the withdrawal agreement in British law, could be amended to reflect calls from different factions within parliament for a customs union, single market membership or a second referendum.“It’s a piece of legislation that is required,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said. “We have been working on the withdrawal agreement Bill for a significant amount of time.”May’s immunitySenior figures in the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers were meeting on Tuesday night to consider proposals to change the rule that has left Mrs May immune from a challenge to her leadership until next December. The prime minister has promised to resign before the next stage of Brexit negotiations but some Brexiteer backbenchers have called on her to announce her departure soon.Nigel Evans, joint executive secretary of the 1922 Committee, said Mrs May should go without delay.“To be honest I would be delighted if she announced today she was announcing her resignation and we could then have an orderly election to choose a new leader of the Conservative Party. I believe the only way we’re going to break this impasse properly is if we have fresh leadership of the Conservative Party,” he told the BBC.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

met oppositionrubana huq first female chief bangladesh","story":"Rubana Huq, managing director of one of Bangladesh\u0026#39s largest conglomerates One of Bangladesh\u0027s foremost female business leaders has vowed to transform job opportunities for women.Rubana Huq – managing director of one of the country’s largest conglomerates – became the first female president of Bangladesh’s national garment workers’ association earlier this month.Despite fierce resistance to her appointment from men in the industry, the pioneering 55-year-old has revealed ambitious plans to tackle female empowerment in the workplace.There are about 4,400 garment factories in Bangladesh, producing clothes for British high street retailers like Topshop, Primark and Marks \u0026amp Spencer. The industry dominates the economy, generating $28.14 billion in 2016-2016 – a figure that represented a staggering 70 per cent the country\u0027s entire export earnings. However, only 150 of these factories are owned by women. Men typically hold the middle management and leadership positions while women – who make up 80 per cent of the workforce – work on the factory floors. It is an imbalance that Huq is keen to address.“I walked into one of our factories a couple of years ago and I asked why do I only see male supervisors, where are the female supervisors?” the association president told The , in her first interview since her ground-breaking appointment earlier this month.“They said, Madam, they don’t want to become supervisors because it’s a lot of responsibility. So, I went down to the factory floor and said how many of you want to be supervisors and nearly all of them raised their hands.”The offices of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters AssociationIt is an attitude Huq is all too familiar with, for her appointment as president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has been met with a “lot of opposition.”Opposition has not come from those who question whether she possesses the necessary experience after all Huq is the managing director and chairman of the Mohammadi Group, which owns lingerie, sweater and woven garments factories all over Bangladesh and employs some four million people. Instead, socially conservative and radical Islamic groups disapprove of women in Bangladesh being allowed to work at all, let alone occupy leadership roles.“Whether the pressure is going to be worth taking, I don’t know, but I want to set a standard for women and tell them that anything is possible,” Huq said.She has already established herself as the standard-bearer for improving working conditions for women in Bangladesh’s garment factories.In 2014, she set up a ground-breaking two-year access course and undergraduate degree for women working in factories at the Asian University for Women in Chittagong. The first cohort will graduate in 2020 and enter into leadership roles in factories.A fire in an illegally-constructed high-rise office building killed at least 25 people and left dozens more injured in Dhaka earlier this month. Safety concerns in the work place are at the top of Huq\u0026#39s agenda“When people ask me if I am excited about my presidency I’m actually not,” Huq said. “I’m more excited about watching the first garment workers graduate next year. For me, that is going to be some moment.”The new president, elected by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association in early April, now plans to introduce several other policies to transform employment opportunities for women in the garment industry.Her experience with the Mohammadi Group led her to conclude that “every second house” in Bangladesh possesses a woman producing textiles.Huq argued that these freelance designers are ultimately held back from expanding their businesses by a lack of capital.“Our Central Bank has a rule that at least 10 per cent of credit has to be given to women but in reality it is something like two to three per cent,” she explained.The president plans to introduce a National Credit Portal, so that entrepreneurial women can directly connect with banks to obtain necessary loans.She will also introduce a female-to-female mentorship scheme in Bangladesh so the nation’s scarce but growing network of businesswomen can inspire and advise others.While female employment rates have improved – from four per cent in 1974 to 33.9 per cent in 2015 – she admits the country still has a long way to go.“The quest is to find a way to re-skill and upskill women and I don’t know whether it will be possible in such a short time, but I believe the journey must begin,” she said.But as well as female empowerment, safety concerns are at the top of Huq\u0027s agenda. In 2013, when the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka collapsed killing more than 1,100 people, many of the dead were crushed as they worked in the building’s garment factories.Bangladeshi rescue workers search for survivors amid the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in 2013The horrifying incident shone a light on adverse working conditions in Bangladesh and as a result international firms with factories in the country agreed to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety.In accordance with the Bangladeshi government, the agreement permitted regular independent inspections in factories and a range of safety upgrades for workers.Accidents still occur, but they do so less frequently. According to a report by New York University\u0027s Stern Centre, 71 workers died annually in Bangladeshi factories before the Rana Plaza incident. Since the Accord was signed, that figure has fallen to 17. But the continued presence of Accord safety inspectors in Bangladesh is under threat. Representatives were due to leave the country in November 2018, but filed a petition to extend their presence. The Supreme Court will decide the outcome on May 19.According to Huq, the Accord’s presence has been very positive, but she believes that the organisation should now make “a graceful exit from Bangladesh.”Instead, the president intends to set up her own monitoring practices following a consultation with Accord representatives to understand remaining safety issues.“They can then move on to other countries in the region like India or Pakistan,” she argued. “These places also have similar accidents but Bangladesh is always hogging the spotlight and I don’t think that is fair.”Huq said the industry has worked hard to improve factory safety, under the terms of the Accord, but added that more can still be done.“The Accord had around 1,900 factories under its jurisdiction, my point is what happens to the rest,” she said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHuq added that there must be greater transparency inside the 745 factories currently under government control, as well as other small, shared facilities which fell outside the Accord\u0027s authority.She said an incident in one of these less visible factories could spook investors across the entire Bangladesh garment industry.“If there are isolated cases we should be able to deal with them instead of someone picking that story up and turning it into a huge headline,” Huq said. “That is not how we want to become a headline. I want to hit the headlines with a good story of how this sector is positively impacting women in Bangladesh.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate saying \u0026#39I have entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39Brothers paid to attack Jussie Smollett sue his lawyers for defamationBrexit latest news: Theresa May accuses Labour of dragging its feet in compromise talks as Jeremy Corbyn says PM is still refusing to budgeComment: Whether or not Isil was responsible for the atrocities in Sri Lanka, its threat remains undimmed Former French PM Fillon and British wife face trial over \u0026#39fake jobs\u0026#39 scandalComment: Blaming Brexit for Northern Ireland killings takes pressure off the terrorists who commit themInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?Police chief admits up to 60 per cent of crime is not fully investigated because of a lack of officersGender neutral boats on the rise as Maritime Museum vows to remove all signs referring to ships as \u0026#39she\u0026#39\u0026#39Air bear\u0026#39 flight to Russian Arctic returns polar bear who drifted 400 miles south on icePopular children to be recruited as anti-drug \u0026#39influencers\u0026#39 in Government funded projectWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/23/TELEMMGLPICT000194606897_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cathay pacific flight attendants randomly inspected taking home","story":"A Cathay Pacific passenger plane prepares to land at Hong Kong\u0026#39s international airport on March 13, 2019Flight attendants for Hong Kong’s largest airline will be randomly inspected after staff were reported to be making off with in-flight goodiesIce cream cups, bottles of champagne, cutlery, wine glasses and bread are some of the items Cathay Pacific staff are said to have taken home as an “unofficial perk,” according to the South China Morning Post.“In view of an increasing number of reported losses of company property, we have informed our cabin crew that random inspections will be carried out,” said the company in a written statement to The  on Tuesday.Cathay’s flight attendants union confirmed a number of staff were searched April 17, when flight CX415 from Seoul landed in Hong Kong, and Cathay said it was dealing with six employees who had been caught with company property  “in a fair and reasonable manner.”The airline has a zero-tolerance policy on taking company property, according to an internal memo circulated in January in which Ed Higgs, Cathay’s General Manager Inflight Services, warned staff the searches would take place.Staff caught taking company property could lose their jobs, Mr Higgs said.All airlines have a policy where staff are not allowed to take company property, said Venus Fung, Chairperson of the Cabin Attendants Union of Hong Kong, but she called for more empathy from Cathay for its staff, saying that the spot checks showed little respect for the crew. “It’s a huge airline. We’re also human beings. A bottle of water, something small to eat, they shouldn’t make such a huge deal,” said Ms Fung. “From a union perspective we find it quite disappointing.”She asked the airline to speak to staff to find out why the items were taken, and see if there were any employee needs being unmet.“In every company there’s somebody like that who takes company property. I don’t think they should generalise it to all cabin crew.”Cathay does allow staff to take water, fruit, film-wrapped sandwiches and pre-read newspapers off its planes, said Mr Higgs.Cathay posted a profit of HK$2.3 billion last year after two back-to-back years of losses.  The airline began a 3-year restructuring and cost-cutting exercise in 2017.Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate saying \u0026#39I have entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39Brothers paid to attack Jussie Smollett sue his lawyers for defamationBrexit latest news: Theresa May accuses Labour of dragging its feet in compromise talks as Jeremy Corbyn says PM is still refusing to budgeComment: Whether or not Isil was responsible for the atrocities in Sri Lanka, its threat remains undimmed Former French PM Fillon and British wife face trial over \u0026#39fake jobs\u0026#39 scandalComment: Blaming Brexit for Northern Ireland killings takes pressure off the terrorists who commit themInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?Police chief admits up to 60 per cent of crime is not fully investigated because of a lack of officersGender neutral boats on the rise as Maritime Museum vows to remove all signs referring to ships as \u0026#39she\u0026#39\u0026#39Air bear\u0026#39 flight to Russian Arctic returns polar bear who drifted 400 miles south on icePopular children to be recruited as anti-drug \u0026#39influencers\u0026#39 in Government funded projectComment: Want to stop Brexit?

Visitors to Morocco have long flocked to the roads outside Marrakech to take photographs of goats who climbed into the low boughs of the Argania tree. Such pictures are widely shared on social media and often decorate the pages of guide books to Morocco. But an investigation by Aaron Gekoski, a British environmentalist photographer, has uncovered that the tourist destination seems to be an exploitative scam. Local farmers appear to be bringing the goats in from other areas and forcing them into the trees before charging tourists to take photographs of them. When the goats eventually tire from balancing on the tree branches they are brought down and new goats are swapped in. Campaigners claim an iconic tourist photo destination where dozens of goats perch in trees has been uncovered as an exploitative scam.After seeing tourists\u0027 interest in the tree-dwelling goats, some opportunistic farmers decide to manipulate the situation for financial gain,” said Mr Gekoski. I heard they even brought goats in from other areas, built platforms in the trees and now cajole the goats into the trees, charging tourists to take photographs.They will take the goats home in the late afternoon, before coaxing them back into the trees at sunrise.The goats are incredibly nimble and dextrous when it comes to navigating the trees, though generally they just stand in one place, looking rather sick and forlorn.All the tourists who visited seemed blissfully unaware though and \u0027oohed\u0027 and \u0027ahhed\u0027 before taking photos and selfies.”Mr Gekoski has hosted a number of environmental television programmes and is currently working on a campaign to end cruel wildlife tourism attractions. The Morocco investigation was part of that work. He said: The goats are often rotated halfway through the day as they get tired.Opportunistic farmers brought goats in from other areas and forced them into the trees before charging travellersIt\u0027s incredibly hot work standing in a tree all day and generally the goats are in poor condition and very skinny.There were also almost no older goats, which I heard get eaten.The farmers will also hand over young goats, known as kids, for photo opportunities in front of the trees.Also, having so many goats in one place threatens the sustainability of the trees as their hooves damage the branches.Elsewhere in Morocco, women will harvest Argan oil by hand, which is more ethical and environmentally friendly.Dr Chris Draper, head of animal welfare and captivity at the charity Born Free, said: Images of goats in trees have become iconic, suggesting a rural idyll where crafty and agile animals have learned to make the most of their environmentSadly, the reality seems to be that this is anything but natural, and is instead an exploitative set-up, designed to snare unsuspecting tourists to pay to take pictures.The animals are unable or unwilling to move from where they are placed in the trees by people.This means that they will be unable to move into shade or to forage in a normal manner.The situation is likely to be very stressful for the goats, made worse by being placed next to a busy road and with streams of visitors stopping to take a look.This is just one of several issues of which we are aware in Morocco where animals are being abused to cater for a demand and provide photo opportunities for tourists.Born Free urges everyone to keep an eye out for animals while travelling and on holiday: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.Born Free will soon be launching our new initiative, Raise the Red Flag, to collate public reports of animals in need, and to provide people with the tools to make their voice heard for animals.Please review our commenting policyRachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate saying \u0026#39I have entered politics to spend more time with my

stay power egypt 2030 referendum victory","story":"A man walks in front of a banner reading, \u0026#34Yes to the constitutional amendments, for a better future\u0026#34 with a picture of Mr Sisi.Egypt’s constitution will be amended to allow President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to remain in office until 2030 after the government claimed to have won 89 per cent support in a much-criticised referendum. The Egyptian electoral commission said 11 per cent of citizens voted against the constitutional amendments, which also tighten Mr Sisi’s grip on the judiciary and expand the military’s role in Egyptian politics.   Amnesty International condemned the referendum as a sham, saying the lack of debate over the major constitutional changes showed “the Egyptian government\u0027s contempt for the rights of all people in Egypt”.Mr Sisi’s supporters hailed the changes as necessary to allow the president to stay in office so he could continue economic reforms and crush a jihadist insurgency in the Sinai desert.  Government supporters honked car horns in central Cairo and blared celebratory music after the result was announced.   The constitutional changes are the latest step in Mr Sisi’s consolidation of power since he toppled Egypt’s elected Islamist president in a 2013 military coup and seized control of the state. Since then, his government has jailed tens of thousands of people in mass trials and allegedly performed secret executions and widespread use of torture in Egyptian prisons. Almost all of Egypt’s independent media has been brought to heel and political opponents have been jailed or driven into exile. The constitutional changes scrap the presidential two-term limit which was brought in after the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, which saw the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak after 30 years in power. Mr Sisi will now be able to stay in office until 2030, by which point he will have been in control of Egypt for 17 years. The amendments also give Mr Sisi new powers to directly appoint judges and the country’s top prosecutor. The International Commission of Jurists called the changes “a flagrant assault on the rule of law”.An Egyptian soldier stands on guard during the referendumThe military is also given a specific mandate “protect the constitution and democracy, which critics see as a justification for future military involvement in civilian politics.  The changes will also lead to the creation of a second chamber in Egypt’s parliament known as the Council of Senators. Two-thirds of the 180 senators will be elected by the public and Mr Sisi will appoint the remaining third. Finally, the changes introduce a quota to ensure that at least 25 per cent of members of parliament are women. The constitutional reforms were pushed through at rapid speed. Egypt’s parliament, which is dominated by Sisi loyalists, only finalised the text of the amendments last Tuesday - three days before voting in the referendum began.   An elderly Egyptian woman casts her ballot in a box during the referendumOpponents of the changes were not allowed to campaign while the Yes vote was boosted in pro-government media and in posters which plastered cities across Egypt. The Egyptian government blocked 34,000 websites in an effort to prevent opponents from organising an online petition against the referendum, according to NetBlocks, an internet freedom group. Mr Sisi’s allies offered working-class voters payments of 50 Egyptian pounds (£2) or cartons of basic foodstuffs like oil and rice in return for a Yes vote. The scale of the Yes victory announced Tuesday was relatively modest compared to previous elections. Mr Sisi won 97 per cent of the vote in his past two presidential elections, according to official figures. Mr Sisi presented himself as more concerned with affairs of state than the referendum campaign. On Tuesday, he hosted African leaders in Cairo for a summit about the situation in Libya, where an Egyptian-backed warlord is trying to overthrow the UN-backed government, and Sudan, where protesters recently overthrew their authoritarian leader. Mr Sisi was hosted by Donald Trump at the White House several weeks before the referendum, in what seen as a sign of tacit American approval for his constitutional overhaul. Despite Mr Sisi’s human rights record, the Trump administration sees Egypt as an ally in the fight against terrorism and is looking to Cairo to help support its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, which is due to be released this summer. Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate saying \u0026#39I have entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltyBrothers paid to attack Jussie Smollett sue his lawyers for defamationBrexit latest news: Theresa May accuses Labour of dragging its feet in compromise talks as Jeremy Corbyn says PM is still refusing to budgeComment: Whether or not Isil was responsible for the atrocities in Sri Lanka, its threat remains undimmed Former French PM Fillon and British wife face trial over \u0026#39fake jobs\u0026#39 scandalComment: Blaming Brexit for Northern Ireland killings takes pressure off the terrorists who commit themInside a royal rift: what\u0026#39s really going on with William and Harry?Police chief admits up to 60 per cent of crime is not fully investigated because of a lack of officersGender neutral boats on the rise as Maritime Museum vows to remove all signs referring to ships as \u0026#39she\u0026#39\u0026#39Air bear\u0026#39 flight to Russian Arctic returns polar bear who drifted 400 miles south on icePopular children to be recruited as anti-drug \u0026#39influencers\u0026#39 in Government funded projectComment: Want to stop Brexit?

In the US, the film is\u0026nbspexpected to earn between $250m and $268m in the first three days of release.The biggest domestic debut of all time is last year’s Infinity War, the precursor to Endgame, which earned $257.7m during that period, making it fairly likely\u0026nbspthat Endgame will take the top spot. Star Wars: The Force Awakens currently sits in second place with $248m and The Last Jedi sits in third with $220m. Only six films have earned more than $200m in their opening weekends.\u0026nbspInfinity War also currently boasts the best global launch with $640m, although it didn’t beat the international record as the film opened in China two weeks after most other territories.\u0026nbspFate of the Furious currently holds the record for the best international opening weekend with $443m.\u0026nbspEndgame, however, will open globally at the same time, with current predictions suggesting it could earn more than $800m in total on opening weekend, which would also put it in a good position to beat Fate of the Furious for the international record.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

When Danielle Atkins joined the company as vice president\u0026nbspand global chief brand officer\u0026nbspin 2014, the business was just emerging from bankruptcy, struggling to keep up with new trends and no longer resonating with younger audiences.Four years later,\u0026nbspKodak is not completely out of the woods.\u0026nbspBut it’s already doing better, with a growing brand licensing business worth $3m\u0026nbsp(£2.3m) and a consumer ision which brought $48m (£36.5m) in revenue during the third quarter of last year. Atkins was arguably one of the biggest players behind the brand’s revival. Throughout her career, she was never one to shy away from a challenge.“When I left my position as a marketing director at Beats\u0026nbspBy Dre, my 17-year-old son asked\u0026nbspme, ‘Why would you leave Beats for Kodak? What is Kodak?’” she tells The Independent.A View from the Top with Greg Jackson, CEO of green energy Octopus“But for me, working for that brand, which in my mind was one of the greatest in the world, was a big exciting opportunity. Kodak had forgotten that they had a brand that people genuinely cared about.”Her passion for the\u0026nbspcompany started during her childhood in Penzance. John Adams, her father, was one of the pioneers of the west Cornwall surf scene in the 1960s and made Super 8mm films featuring local surfers, while her mother Sally was a stills photographer.“When my brother and I were young we used to travel around with my parents, while my father was showing his movies,” Atkins\u0026nbspsays.\u0026nbsp“At that time you couldn’t see surf movies in the cinema and there was no video or YouTube.\u0026nbsp“We had this incredibly bohemian lifestyle, where we were basically brought up on a beach. It was all about surfing, music and film.”After graduating with a degree in history of art and medieval archaeology from UCL, she got a job at Pres.co, one of the first digital agencies working on some of the earliest websites in the late 1990s.“We won Marks \u0026amp Spencer as a client, and I remember being in front of their board aged 21, presenting our first digital campaign – it was a really disruptive time. The big advertisement agencies were still very dominant so what we were doing was very innovative.”Moving quickly up the career ladder, Atkins\u0026nbspheld senior marketing positions at PwC, Nokia and Innovision, where she was responsible for dressing the city for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, including the notorious installation of the Olympic Rings on the Tower Bridge that she still refers to as one of the biggest highlights of her career.Looking for her next challenge, she quit her job as director of creative expression at Nokia in 2013\u0026nbspfor what was then a small start-up called Beats By Dre.“It was a huge job but that’s the point about going to startups,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“Beats only had about 70 to 80 people employees at the time and the volume of work we did was incredible.”Her energy and her collaborative approach saw massive growth in both the company’s sales and revenue. Notably, she led the team who made Beats the\u0026nbsp“most talked about brand” during the 2014 Brazil World Cup with\u0026nbsp“The Game Before The Game” campaign.Featuring footballers including Cesc Fabregas, Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge ​and Brazil’s\u0026nbspNeymar alongside non-sporting celebrities, the star-studded advert accumulated nearly 34 million views on YouTube.“It was a five-minute\u0026nbspvideo that we launched like a film and activated in every single city around the world,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“I was just 34-years-old at the time and working with a very young team. For us, it felt a huge job and it was thrilling every day.”But things changed quickly when Beats was acquired by Apple in 2014.“I enjoy working in a very fast-paced environment, which enables me to be entrepreneurial. This was very easy to do at Beats but much harder to do in a company like Apple. Some people from my team still work there, so it really depends on your personality, I think,” she says.Created with Sketch.The moment it all went wrong for Kodak Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.George Eastman, left, who founded Kodak in 1892, and1884: American inventor George Eastman (pictured in 1925), who later becomes founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, patents photographic film stored in a roll 1888: The Kodak name is trademarked.

You need to look at what you have and what you can work with.\u0026nbspWhat I had was a brand with an amazing history, heritage and a legacy of incredible branding and graphic design.”Part of the inspiration behind the redesign of the company was looking back at the heritage of the brand and weaving\u0026nbspthe vision of Kodak’s founder, George Eastman back into it.For this reason, the first thing Atkins did was to bring back a similar iteration of the Kodak K logo\u0026nbspintroduced in 1971. “I started spotting old Kodak logos everywhere around the world, so I wanted to revive and bring back the colour into the logo,” she explains.More than a hundred years earlier, Eastman had invented roll film, allowing photography to become a hobby of the masses.\u0026nbsp“You don’t buy a Kodak Carousel slide viewer, you buy yesterday” –\u0026nbspas Don Draper told Kodak’s executives at the end of Mad Men’s first season, in one of the TV show’s most poignant moments.\u0026nbsp“It’s a time machine.”Atkins says: “With an amazing heritage brand like Kodak, leveraging that nostalgic element is important, but if you want to build a future business you can’t just rest on solely on heritage.”But if Kodak was going to stage a comeback in consumers’ hearts, it needed today’s teenagers and influencers behind it. This was no small task.When Atkins joined, Kodak didn’t even have an Instagram account – “just another example of how the brand had lost its way”.\u0026nbspMy father always said you should nail your colour to the mast. If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to tryFast-forward four years, and it now has a healthy\u0026nbsp400,000 followers, which Atkins describes as a community of creatives who\u0026nbspcare about the brand.In fact, the company is resurrecting one of Kodak’s most popular films, Ektachrome – a colour reversal, or transparency, film launched in 1946 and discontinued in 2013.Using her experience at Beats, Atkins also spearheaded a series of fashion collaborations with brands including\u0026nbspOpening Ceremony and\u0026nbspForever 21.The clothes for the latter were emblazoned with Kodak logos from the 1990s, harking back to when Kodak was the most recognisable photography brand.“One thing I learned at Beats, is that there’s never a better promotion than someone recognisable wearing your brand,” Atkins says.The\u0026nbspvogue for all things analogue has also paved for the company to launch Kodachrome, an art magazine coined as a “new journal for anyone who loves art, film, and analogue culture”. The latest cover story was on Spike Lee, just after the release of BlacKkKlansman, which was shot on film.Youngsters’\u0026nbsplove affair with modern nostalgia is also helping to fuel demand for instant print, one of Kodak’s biggest sectors.Atkins says: “Large numbers of still photographers and creative are turning their backs on digital technology in favour of film. There’s something romantic about the process.”The reward was perhaps changing her son Zachary’s mind about Kodak.“He now thinks what we’re doing is very cool and for me that is a sign we’re doing things right.”Atkins certainly has energy. This year, she is training for a running race that\u0026nbspwill take her from Los Angeles to Las Vegas – 340 miles across the hostile terrain of the Nevada desert. With her brother last year she finished a bike ride from Cornwall to Mont Saint Michel in France.A view from the top with Regina Borda, Pizza Hut managing directorA View from the Top with Mark CuddiganA View from the Top with Jo Malone, the ‘Queen of fragrance’Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children’s minister Kodak shares double after launching its own cryptocurrency“My father always said you should nail your colour to the mast,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to try.”Atkins, also mother to Eli, 11, firmly believes that women shouldn’t choose between having a career and having a family.“I was scared about having children, the whole idea of being pregnant scared me,” she says.\u0026nbsp“But I now consider them my two biggest achievements in life. It never stopped me from doing what I wanted.“You just have to be organised and also set a good example to people in your team, especially if you’re in a leading position.“I have to force myself to take an hour a day that is just for me – and it’s usually sports related or just walking my dog.\u0026nbsp You need that time, otherwise your head is always crowded with things.”Atkins is now working on\u0026nbspa business plan with an entrepreneur for Kodak’s latest project in the beauty sector – another first for the brand.“There’s a connection between looking good on camera and the beauty industry,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“It’s one of the most exciting projects that we’ve got and it’s directly associated with Hollywood, film and glamour.\u0026nbsp“Even if we’ve never done it before, it seems to be like there’s a natural connection. It’s all about always having a genuine commitment to innovation and creativity.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders.

The parasitic disease kills about 435,000 people every year – the majority of them children under the age of five in Africa.Pedro Alonso, director of WHO’s malaria program, said similar vaccination programmes would begin in the coming weeks in Kenya and Ghana, with the aim of reaching about 360,000 children across the three countries.Mr Alonso called the vaccination rollout a “historic\u0026nbspmoment”. Despite acknowledging the vaccine was flawed, he said the world could not afford to wait for a better option. “We don’t know how long it will take to develop the next-generation vaccine. It may be many, many years away.”Created with Sketch.Can malaria be beaten? Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The vaccine, known as Mosquirix, was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2015.A previous trial showed the vaccine was about 30 per cent effective in children who got four doses, but that protection waned over time. Reported side effects include pain, fever and convulsions.It took GSK and partners more than 30 years to develop the vaccine, at a cost of around $1bn\u0026nbsp(£770m). GSK is donating up to 10 million vaccine doses in the current vaccination initiatives. A company spokesman said GSK is working with partners to secure funding for potentially broader vaccination programmes.AFPGetty Images)Mr Alonso said the stalled progress against malaria demanded tools to combat now, noting that it was significantly more difficult to design a vaccine against a parasite as opposed to a bacterium or virus.Resistance is growing to medicines that treat the disease, while mosquitoes are becoming more resistant to insecticides. In addition, funding for malaria efforts has plateaued in recent years.Watch David Beckham ‘speak in nine languages\u0027 about malariaDrug that makes human blood \u0027lethal\u0027 to mosquitoes can combat malaria“It’s an imperfect vaccine but it still has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives,” said Alister Craig, dean of biological sciences at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, who is not linked to WHO or vaccine.Mr Craig said immunising the most vulnerable children during peak malaria seasons could spare many thousands from falling ill or even dying.Some experts have warned the vaccination programmes should not ert limited public health funds from inexpensive and proven tools to curb malaria such as bed nets and insecticides.“This is a bold thing to do, but it’s not a silver bullet,” said Thomas Churcher, a malaria expert at Imperial College London. “As long as using the vaccine doesn’t interfere with other efforts, like the urgent need for new insecticides, it is a good thing to do.”Mr Craig said one of health officials’ biggest challenges could be convincing parents to bring their children for repeated doses of a vaccine that only protects about a third of children for a limited amount of time.More commonly used vaccines, like those for polio and measles, work more than 90 per cent of the time. “This malaria vaccine is going to save many lives, even if it is not as good as we would like,” Mr Craig said. “But I hope this will kick-start other research efforts so that the story doesn’t end here.”Additional reporting by APOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature, writes Erica WickersonClick to followThe IndependentLove Means Love: Cordelia visits her ailing father King Lear, who feels ashamed of falling for the £350m-a-week promises made by his elder daughtersThe chaos of politics, the searing isions through society, the promised demise of faith in democracy: it might look like the country is in an unprecedented state of strife and upheaval over Brexit. But writers have been talking about this stuff for centuries.King Lear’s shuffle into dementia as he tears apart his kingdom on a vain whim. Dickens’s revolutionary bloodshed in A Tale of Two Cities conjuring tensions within and across borders. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman challenging the imperialist march of the Nazis in Casablanca. How does culture sort out the bloody mess of social, political\u0026nbspand geographical isions? Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature.Ali Smith’s Autumn – the first in her seasonal quartet (the third in the cycle, Spring, has just come out) – is perhaps the first “Brexit novel” (what a terrifying label!), written in the immediate wake of the 2016 referendum. Its opening lines wave to Dickens: “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.” Too right, Ali. “That’s the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will.” Here a nod to Yeats’s A Second Coming. Yeats, Smith, Dickens, Shakespeare: they’re all rife with images of separation, objects torn asunder. Yeats writes:Things fall apart the centre cannot holdAll too apt for today. In last year’s National Theatre production, Ian McKellen’s King Lear actually tears up the map of his kingdom in a haphazard, manically whimsical way. Dickens’s evocation of “Madame La Guillotine”, sensuously and seductively worshipped by the revolutionaries in A Tale of Two Cities, replacing crucifixes and covering the streets with blood, is an object that literally and metaphorically separates. And this is a thread taken up by Smith in the literary descriptions of collage art scattered across Autumn: beautiful and haphazard like fallen leaves, but also artistically juxtaposing separation and difference.Created with Sketch.The 25 best books by women Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire.

It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.These works show the chopping up of society along multiple axes. Politics. Class. Nationality. Age. A Brexit checklist.There is a widely held perception that it was the baby boomers who swung the 2016 referendum in favour of Leave, the older generation who have a lot less to lose. This generational ide reverberates through cultural depictions of ided nations too.Brexit: The Uncivil War review – an engrossing second draft of historyShakespeare’s King Lear is a play about madness and politics, shown through the failings of a father. Lear decides to bequeath his three daughters different portions of his kingdom according to how much they love him or rather, how convincingly they can express their love for him. Literature is all about conflict. So perhaps it’s unsurprising that not all of Lear’s daughters go along with this display of pride and vanity.The first two, Goneril and Regan, egged on by their greedy husbands, eagerly flatter their father. But when it comes to the third, Cordelia – the youngest and the favourite – the voice of reason prevails. She tells her father that she loves him just as much as a dutiful daughter should but that there’s no need to flatter his delusion of a good Brexit deal. Ahem. The need for a healthy sized dowry with which she can attract a good husband.King Lear is so convinced of his worth and his children’s performance of love for him, that he makes the biggest booboo possible just as he’s on the decline: he chops up his kingdom and pisses off his loved ones. The UK is so convinced of Europe’s desperation to be friends, we’ve made the booboo of expecting an Ali Baba Cave of Wonders with the Brexit deal. And it’s about as realistic an expectation as Ali Baba’s treasure.A Tale of Two Cities\u0026nbspis in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across bordersA Tale of Two Cities is also, in effect, about politics and madness, and how the shadows of the older generation linger over the young. It’s set during the reign of terror, late\u0026nbsp18th century Paris and London, the French Revolution. And this period is conjured through the twisted fate of a father, daughter, and two men who bear a striking physical resemblance to one another but are diametrically opposed in character. Like Shakespeare, Dickens also shows the father being cause of his beloved daughter’s despair, but, in his case, it is unwitting. It is the father’s accidental testimony that ultimately leads to the death sentence for his son-in-law, Charles Darnay.Ali Smith’s Autumn is a quiet elegy to a Europe in demise, and the condemned, precarious young who have to watch it falter. It effectively picks up the ShakespeareanDickensian tale from the perspective of the daughter. The protagonist, Elisabeth Demand: 32 years old, no-fixed-hours casual contract junior lecturer at a university in London, living the dream, her mother says, and she is, if the dream means having no job security and almost everything being too expensive to do and that you’re still in the same rented flat you had when you were a student over a decade ago.Stryver at Tellson’s Bank, from a scene in ‘A Tale of Two Cities’\u0026nbsp(Getty)In many ways, she epitomises a generation, or at least part of it.\u0026nbspElisabeth loves and desperately clings to her dying friend, the 101-year-old former émigré, Daniel Gluck – the personification of a disappearing Europe, a cultured, sensitive, intelligent man, full of possibility and mystery. By contrast, Elisabeth has a strained relationship with her mother – a woman more interested in going to the pub than getting to know her neighbours.These stories show the fuck-ups of the older generation condemning the young to a life of lost possibility – the lost possibility to travel, to live, to love as we want.But it was also overwhelmingly the case that non-graduates were far more likely to vote to leave the EU than those with degrees. And this brings up the question of class and privilege.At the heart of A Tale of Two Cities is a raging class war, a class war of caricatured evil. The Marquis St\u0026nbspEvrémonde, the aristocrat who needs no fewer than four servants to prepare his morning hot chocolate while people starve in the streets, speeds through Paris in his voluptuous carriage and hits a small child, killing him instantly. He insults the crowd, calls them dogs, curses them for delaying him and not taking better care of their children. Then he goes on his way, barely ruffled. In this climate, the bloodthirsty rising of the proletariat seems to have a pretty strong justification.A Tale of Two Cities is in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across borders. One of the factors that damns the hero, Charles Darnay, is his decision to live in exile in England. He explains this as an economic immigration: in France, he has no means to live.A Tale of Two Cities and its modernised re-telling in Casablanca both resolve the turgid concoction of political and romantic tensions (semi-spoiler alert) through acts of self-sacrifice. One person trades places with another. We see this kind of doubling in King Lear too with the half-brothers Edmund and Edgar, alike in name but polar opposites in character. And, much like Harry Potter and Voldemort (a DickensianShakespearean echo?), it seems that in each of these pairs, one must die so that the other may live.King Lear\u0026nbspshows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?)This isn’t really a satisfactory solution to today’s problems. There isn’t the possibility of some kind of self-sacrifice that will ensure continued life in another sense. Maybe a soft Brexit looks like that: a Brexit in name but with all the benefits of the customs union and free movement. But it now seems inevitable that the country is going to be fundamentally ided no matter what the political developments may yield.But it’s worth remembering that all of these works are also basically love stories – though not necessarily about conventional, romantic love.King Lear shows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?).\u0026nbspA Tale of Two Cities shows an impossible love triangle between upstanding French émigrés and disaffected, drunken Brits that cannot end happily. There aren’t enough visas for all the protagonists to escape France, so who will make it out?Casablanca is a classic romance that transcends geographical borders. As Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) looks into Rick’s (Humphrey Bogart’s) eyes and tells him she can never leave him again, but she does need the two blank visas that will enable escape from Casablanca and the Nazis, the tears feel real, the kiss feels passionate, the violins soar. Later, Rick sees this moment in a different light. He suggests it was a way of manipulating him into aiding the escape.Bros)And so, we go back to King Lear. His elder daughters make eloquent expressions of their love for him, but it’s clear to everyone other than Lear himself that these are opportunistic overtures with one thing in mind: hope for geographical reign and economic power.The problem for the UK is that the EU isn’t as senile and blinded by vanity as Lear, nor as romantically sentimental as Bogart’s Rick or Dickens’s Sydney Carton. Expressions of love won’t get us through passport control any faster in the post-Brexit world.So what does Ali Smith’s Autumn suggest? Unlike Edgar and Edmund in King Lear, Charles and Sydney in A Tale of Two Cities, Rick and Laszlo in Casablanca, there is no straightforward doubling in Smith’s Autumn. But perhaps that’s part of the point. Elisabeth and Daniel are opposites in many respects. And yet they are drawn together in a touching, benevolent, platonic bond.The 25 best books written by womenThere’s a problem with the way we idolise drunk male writersThe most powerful lines of poetry ever writtenConservatives and Labour reveal plans for key Brexit votes- liveCummings found in contempt of parliament over ‘fake news’ inquiryIn Autumn, the man in the post office, a frustratingly unhelpful clerk positively filibustering Elisabeth’s attempts to do the “Check \u0026amp Send” service to renew her passport (all a huge great metonym for anxieties about identity, nationality, freedom to travel, etc), sees Elisabeth as many of this generation are seen: demanding like her name.“Is your surname really Demand? he says.Uh huh, Elisabeth says. I mean yes.A name you live up to, he says.”The contrasting way of seeing things is a point worth pondering in the light of Brexit and the fog of politics. In Casablanca, Laszlo and Rick are both in love with Ilse. But they see her in very different ways. When she tries to explain herself, her past, her motives to each of them in turn, she is confronted with totally contrasting responses. Laszlo: “You don’t even have to say it. I’ll believe.”\u0026nbspCompare with Rick: “I wouldn’t believe you, no matter what you told me. You’d say anything now to get what you want.”Isn’t this really how most of us feel about politicians? They represent these dualisms. And nothing epitomises this quite like the Brexit debate. People choose their side then believe all or nothing, depending on who’s talking. £350m\u0026nbspfor the NHS. Whether or not it was true seemed to depend more on the listener than the facts.In reality, there is no possibility for self-sacrifice or a deus ex machina to sort out the cataclysmic mess of parliament, Brexit\u0026nbspand national ision. The older stories, Shakespeare and Dickens, are tragedies. Someone has to die. Casablanca is more open, though still pretty heart-wrenching. Remember the famous closing line: “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”. And maybe Ali Smith picks up where Casablanca leaves off. A beautiful friendship. But the ending is left open. This is where we are now. Watching our relationship with Europe die. But at the end of Autumn, Europe’s personification rallies, he wakes up, asks what Elisabeth is reading, smiles. There is still time.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.In an interview with India’s CNN News-18, Feige\u0026nbspfurther teased the project, adding: “I think every movie that we do is a risk. We only want to do movies that people seem to think are risks. Doing the story of an Asian-American hero of Chinese heritage is something that is very intriguing to us. It will be really different and special.”“I hope audiences around the world respond to it in the same way they did to Steve Rogers.. whether they have American flag or not.\u0026nbspIt’s about the inidual storyline, spectacle and adventure that come with Marvel Studios movies.”Avengers: Endgame is out in UK cinemas on 25 April.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s the job of Remain politicians to defend them against the hate speech and acts that have\u0026nbspbeen on the rise since the EU referendum – not to join in.”She added that the episode “demonstrates the risks of assembling a list of celebrity candidates without having time to know their values”.The Independent Group registers as political party for EU electionsChange.org hits out at Independent Group MPs over new nameMcDonnell calls the Independent Group ‘completely irrelevant’“It underlines the extent to which Change UK is an empty prospectus: without a platform and with no idea which group they will sit with in the European parliament, how can they ask voters to choose their candidates?” she said.Mr Sadjady cancelled his membership of the Conservative party in March, citing the party’s handling of Brexit and Islamophobia allegations against it.He was unveiled as a candidate for Change UK to represent London on Tuesday in the upcoming European parliament elections.Other candidates for the party include former BBC journalist Gavin Esler, the former conservative deputy prime minister of Poland Jacek Rostowski, and Rachel Johnson, a journalist who is also the sister of Boris Johnson.At its election campaign launch the party said it would unveil some policies in the future, but immediately confirmed it would not be supporting a no-confidence vote in Theresa May’s government – potentially throwing the embattled prime minister a lifeline.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have kept my promise.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspnarrowly defeated the strongly favoured Mr Yildirim\u0026nbspof the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 31 March municipal elections that represented an unexpected setback for Mr Erdogan, who built his career as mayor of Istanbul 25 years ago. The city has served as the political backbone of the AKP, generating huge real estate deals that benefit the country\u0027s powerful development conglomerates and various oligarchs who support the party.“It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage, said Emre Erdogan, a political scientist at Istanbul\u0027s Bilgi University. They don’t want to transfer ownership\u0026nbspof the municipality. It means they will fight for it.Ekrem Imamoglu arrives at the Istanbul Election Board on Wednesday (EPA)The AKP\u0026nbspand its far-right ally, the National Movement Party (MHP), have\u0026nbspchallenged the elections,\u0026nbsppointing to unspecified irregularities. First\u0026nbspthey demanded\u0026nbspa recount, and now they are pushing for holding the entire Istanbul elections anew.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspholds\u0026nbspa 13,000-vote lead. There were few if any complaints or reports of election-day irregularities, and the AKP has yet to present any evidence to back up its claims of fraud. Mr Erdogan’s own interior minister Suleyman Soylu on Wednesday rejected the AKP’s fraud claims. “The election system in Turkey is better than anywhere else in the world,” local media quoted him as saying. “The system has no flaws. Such a discussion is baseless.Legal experts say the Supreme Election Commission – which is said to be packed with appointees by Mr​ Erdogan – could still vacate Mr Imamoglu’s mandate, and call for another election, and many analysts said they could not fathom the AKP not fighting for Istanbul until the end.It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage. They don’t want to transfer ownership of the municipality.The Supreme Election Council has already ordered a redo of the municipal contest in Honaz, a town of 30,000 that the AKP lost by a single vote.But that would carry risks for the government and the ruling party. Increasingly impatient supporters of Mr Imamoglu have been chanting in support of his mayoralty at football games, and a rerun of the election could draw even more opposition voters frustrated by a flailing economy and eroding political freedoms under the AKP.\u0026nbspStill some people can\u0027t countenance the idea of the AKP giving up on Istanbul, even if it means further undermining Turkey\u0027s fragile democratic institutions.\u0026nbspFor the AKP, the cost of losing Istanbul is greater than\u0026nbspthe image of\u0026nbspTurkey as a liberal democracy, said Mr Erdogan, the scholar.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thursday will be the day, it was announced, Vladimir Putin will come face to face with Kim Jong-un in Vlaostok.\u0026nbspFrantic preparations already underway in Russia’s far-eastern capital had, of course, offered plenty of clues: the delivery of a blacked-out limousine, the arrival of two plane loads of security detail, an airport altercation between said detail and journalists, a resultant broken TV camera, and last-minute modifications to roads, ramps and station entrances to accommodate the North Korean convoy.\u0026nbspAs expected, Vlaostok’s Far Eastern Federal University looks to be the venue for the talks. Located on an island, its isolation is said to have impressed North Korean security chiefs. The university campus,\u0026nbspbuilt\u0026nbspto host the 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, also boasts enough luxury\u0026nbsphotel space\u0026nbspto accommodate the 230-strong delegation. By Tuesday morning, North Korean flags had appeared around the university.\u0026nbspSources in Moscow and Pyongyang suggested Mr Jong-un will travel the 425 miles from Pyongyang to Vlaostok aboard his famous armoured train, arriving in Russia sometime on Wednesday. Talks are due the following day, with the Russian leader leaving for dialogue with the Chinese leadership in the evening.\u0026nbspMr Jong-un, on the other hand, will be staying behind for a special “touristic programme”. Among the attractions being considered are a chocolate factory, the\u0026nbspRussian Pacific Navy\u0026nbspMilitary History Museum, and a newly opened branch of St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre.\u0026nbspFor Moscow, the summit represents the culmination of many months of diplomacy.\u0026nbspIt was a year ago that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov first travelled to Pyongyang to pass on Vladimir Putin’s invitation. Major overtures from other senior officials followed. But North Korea hesitated, preferring instead to concentrate on relations with China, South Korea and the United States.\u0026nbspThursday’s summit is the first-ever meeting\u0026nbspbetween the two leaders. But in the eight years since he came to power, Mr Jong-un\u0026nbsphas met with the Chinese leader Xi three times, and twice with Donald Trump –\u0026nbspin Singapore and Hanoi. The breakdown of the US talks appear\u0026nbspto be the main reason Mr Jong-un\u0026nbsphas decided to pivot towards Moscow.\u0026nbsp“Kim achieved nothing in Hanoi, so is now exploring other angles,” said\u0026nbspFyodor Tertitskiy, a North Korean analyst based in Seoul. “Mr Putin is desperate to be considered a person of significance on the Korean peninsula, and to use that\u0026nbspin diplomatic games with Washington.”\u0026nbspRussia, in Soviet times the key player in the region, is now largely deferential to the Chinese on Korean relations. But that does\u0026nbspnot mean they are unwilling\u0026nbspto re-engage, said\u0026nbspthe analyst.Ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesperson\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov said Russia would focus on matters of trade and nuclear disarmament. The Korean side, in return, is likely to press the Russians on how they can relieve the crushing international sanctions regime. But there are significant doubts that the summit will produce any meaningful declaration or agreements.More likely, this summit will instead be used to issue a declaration of intent, with the main recipient of the message being the United States. “It is essentially a sideshow in the continuing saga between Pyongyang and Washington,” said Dmitry Trenin, longtime head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre,\u0026nbspon Twitter. “Russia will seek to score diplomatic points by demonstrating its relevance North Korea\u0026nbspby showing it has options.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other Soviet republics declared independence, and on 8 December the USSR was dissolved.“I want to sleep,” she implores the new mayor, a bonafide member of the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP), shovelling a packet of petitions and letters into his arms. “There’s a lot of noise already and it’s just at the beginning stage of construction.”Macoglu made waves across Turkey on 31 March when he was elected mayor of the city, which is called Dersim in the local Kurdish-dialect\u0026nbspZaza.With a thick, bushy moustache that someone mischievous might liken to that of Joseph Stalin, he has become something of a political celebrity.On the streets of Tunceli, a scenic mountain town criss-crossed by rivers, he was swarmed by well-wishers for selfies, handshakes, hugs or even quick conferrals about city problems – including unemployment, which city officials say has reached 60 per cent.The city had been run by a mayor from the Kurdish-led People’s Democratic Party (HDP) until 2016, when authorities in Ankara deposed the elected co-mayors on vague terrorism charges and imposed a trustee to oversee the city’s affairs. The government-appointed mayor, a loyalist to President Recep Tayyip\u0026nbspErdogan had built a concrete wall around city hall for security and oversaw a clampdown on political freedoms.“This is a place where people are under so much political pressure,” says Canan Ay Dogan, a deputy mayor. “When the trustees came in 2016, the security measures were tightened across the city. And they made people feel so uncomfortable. This created tension in public spaces.”​Macoglu\u0026nbsp(centre) meets constituents on the streets of Tunceli\u0026nbsp(Borzou DaragahiThe Independent)Macoglu won the mayoralty with about 33 per cent of the vote, besting the 28 per cent the candidate of the leftist, Kurdish-led HDP and the 20 per cent of centre-left People’s Republican Party. The candidate of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party won only 14 per cent of the vote.Just days after receiving his official mandate as mayor, Macoglu had the walls around city hall torn down, and the X-ray machine removed, saying he wanted to get rid of “obstacles” between the government and the people. He is also is planning to sell off the city’s official cars, and drives himself back and forth to work.On a recent visit to Tunceli, dozens of well-wishers and citizens with local concerns – like Seda – drifted in and out of the building and of Macoglu’s offices, which were filled with congratulatory bouquets from businesses and luminaries.Macoglu had already won a measure of national acclaim as district mayor of a neighbourhood in Tunceli called Ovacik. When first elected in 2014, he vowed in an interview with the newspaper Cumhuriyet to visit Cuba, China and Venezuela “to analyse the success of communist administrations” and “prove in Turkey that communism is not the bogeyman”.His ideas and policies veered towards the pragmatic.How 1989 became the year that communism collapsedHe posted the neighbourhood’s balance sheet on a banner outside the municipality building. He set up free public transportation corridors to shuttle passengers from home to work and a cooperative to produce and sell local produce.He provided a measure of financial support to teachers fired from their jobs by Erdogan in a crackdown that followed a 2016 coup attempt, helping them to set up dairy and beekeeping businesses.Most successfully, he established a scheme to plant chickpeas, potatoes and beans on state-owned land and then use the proceeds to fund scholarships for poor youth.He now wants to expand his programmes to the entire city, by for example, establishing free public transport along certain downtown routes.“We want to improve the quality of life for everyone, but we must support poor people,” he says. “Basic needs should be met for free. That’s my basic idea.”One programme he hopes to launch is to give villagers seeds and let them\u0026nbspplant on public land repurposed as collective farming areas. “We want to create farming areas so that people can grow their own produce,” he says.He said he’s also keen on drawing more tourists, and hopes to create a number of cultural events, better market the natural beauty of Tunceli, and lure visitors curious about the region’s left-leaning politics.Tunceli, in Turkey’s eastern Anatolia region (GettyiStock)An area populated by Kurds and members of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, Tunceli has a unique tradition of leftist politics that likely can’t be replicated across most of Turkey.Some have likened him to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York City socialist who has become a national sensation in the US.“He’s a product of Tunceli,” says Asli Aydintasbas, a Turkish journalist and political analyst. “Tunceli is a very specific place. It’s counter-establishment. Someone like that could be elected in Tunceli the way someone like AOC could only be elected in the Bronx and Queens.”Like the self-described democratic socialist, Macoglu likes to keep his ears to the ground. All of his best ideas, he says, came from hearing out the needs of constituents.“I listen to people,” he says. “I listen to them and figure out what they want, and then look at the tools that I have.”Over the years as a municipal leader, he’s learned to adjust his aspirations. Addressing the noise complaints of a constituent may not change the world, but it’s doable. “When you’re trying to do big things, it’s not always possible,” he says. “What we’re trying to do is to make the small dreams of people come true.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of them are free.Leaders from across our faith communities are standing together to speak out against slavery.Last year the Church of England and the Catholic Church launched the Safe Car Wash App to help drivers report slavery at car washes — one industry alone that’s thought to have thousands of enslaved workers.After just six months, users have reported over , suspected cases, helping the police to tackle this plague.In my own Diocese I know there is crucially important work going on to support these victims.At All Souls Church in Langham Place, at the heart of the West End, the charity Tamar provides essential support and advocacy by reaching out to women who are suffering through sexual exploitation.Tamar takes inspiration from the two stories of women in the Bible being badly mistreated by men and society,The appeal has built on the work of the Clewer Initiative, which has called for a community -wide response to modern slavery — developing partnerships between the Church, statutory and non-statutory agencies, to create a network of advocates seeking to end modern day slavery.As we celebrate the new le of Jesus Christ, let us remember that new le comes not just after death but for those that are living.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.This week’s devastation of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the remarkable demonstrations of solidarity and generosity that have emerged in its aftermath, are testament to the power of community and show the spirit of resurrection in action.If we could apply that same spirit to the terrible injustice of slavery in our communities, through working together, looking closely for what is hidden in plain sight, and supporting the excellent work of charities, we can give new le to those thousands of victims of modern slavery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has been ten years since the civil war and everyone is getting back to normal.But after the bombs it was complete and utter chaos. People were running in the streets. It was helter skelter.People were literally running to hospital. It was chaos. Bodies everywhere.Like many Christians in Sri Lanka I had a day off so I travelled to see my mother just outside Colombo so we could go to church for morning Mass.But at around am messages flashed up on a WhatsApp group with journalists that there was a sudden blast at St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo.At first we thought it must be an electric transformer exploding or an accident.But then we heard of another at St Anthony’s Church, followed by a born-again Christian church in Batticaloa.I then knew it was well-planned and organised simultaneous attack.Two blasts in at Shangri-La, then the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury came under attack.Security was beefed up and a curfew was imposed and the streets are empty.But everyone is worried there may be more blasts. People are on vigil.It’s shocking. People were so relaxed.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough. Before then, the Tories face twin wipeouts in the local and European elections. The latter may be utterly pointless but nevertheless, a derisory performance is still going to be deeply traumatic when it happens.Theresa May’s ministers have dutully supported her in the past.Her duty is now to step aside immediately, before she accidentally ends up leading her party to an even greater humiliation in a general election than the one it suffered in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A quarter of Brits are sufferers at the moment.Its becoming increasingly typical to develop hay fever later in le, Professor Adam Fox, a consultant allergist who was the clinical lead of Allergy at Guy’s  St Thomas’ Hospital told the .He told the paper that hay fever has been becoming steadily worse every year for the past few years and although experts dont know exactly why middle-aged people are developing it, its thought that pollution is largely to blame.The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at Worcester University has said that increased traffic and poor air quality are causing pollen to become trapped at ground level - keeping it within easy breathing distance of hay fever sufferers.Being overly clean is also thought to be a factor, with Swiss scientists discovering that kids who grow up without pets are more likely to develop allergies.You cant inherit hay fever but some people are more genetically predisposed to have allergies than others.The good news is that although you might develop hay fever in your s, you do generally grow out of it again.Prof Fox said that people tend to stop suffering from it in their s and s.“This is because your immunity begins to decline steadily with age and hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen and our immune system reacts to this pollen.So as you get older, your immune system loses its ‘oompf’ so older hay fever sufferers tend to have an easier time of it, until their hay fever eases off altogether.”Professor Fox isnt the first expert to notice a boom in late on-set hay fever.Its already been suggested that one million people are set to get hay fever for the first time, thanks to climate change.An estimated  per cent of adults in the UK reported suffering from hay fever in , according to research.Last year that figure increased to  per cent with a million new people buying hay fever medicines and remedies for the first time.The rise is believed to be due to changes in our climateA pollen bomb has put more people at risk than ever, with experts saying that a concentration of lots of dferent types of pollen is triggering allergic reactions in people who have never suffered from hay fever before.So, what can you doyou find your eyes suddenly itching Theres currently no cure for hay fever, but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment - to a certain extent.. Have more sexApparently, having sex can help to relieve symptoms of congestion.Max Wiseberg, airborne allergen expert and founder of HayMax barrier balms, said: “Pollen levels are set to rise this week so people with hay fever should be prepared to prevent the onset of unpleasant symptoms.“There is also research which suggests that sex could help with the symptoms, so that may be something to consider although there may be some practical issues around timing and locations.“However there is probably not a more pleasant way to deal with the symptoms of hay fever.”The only downside is that the effects are thought to only effect guys who ejaculate - not women.. Avoid pollenThe most effective way to control hay fever is to avoid exposure to pollen.Allergy UK say the best way to do this is to keep windows and doors closed when inside - especially early in the morning and evening when the pollen count is highest.They also advise avoiding peak pollen times and wearing wraparound sunglasses and a hat to prevent pollen getting onto the face and in the eyes.You should also avoid drying clothes on an outdoor washing line and shower when you get indoors to remove pollen from your skin and hair.. AntihistaminesAntihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks its under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction.Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help with clearing a blocked nose.Theyre available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops.. CorticosteroidsCorticosteroidsare used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect.When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed.Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.. Natural remediesMany people are turning towards natural remedies rather than conventional medicine to alleviate symptoms.Some try inhaling steam to clear congestion while others suggest drinking nettle tea - an anti-inflammatory.. ImmunotherapyFor those with persistent hay fever symptoms, a GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment.This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen, such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000484792681.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"los angeles gangsters rappers hollywood a listers photographs","story":"It offers a glimpse into the world of Los Angeles as seen through the eyes of photographer Estevan Oriol, who is famed for chronicling urban culture in the City of Angels.

The gadgets send pulses to the heart to keep it beating regularly.They are the size of a matchbox, fit in the chest, and consist of a battery, tiny computer circuit and wires, which attach to the heart.Dr Wang said: “Millions of patients rely on implantable medical electronic devices.“However, their batteries are generally bulky, rigid, and have short letimes.

To replace the battery requires another operation every few years which poses a risk of infection.”Prof Jeremy Pearson, from the British Heart Foundation, said: “This innovative technology moves us closer to a pacemaker that needs no batteries.“Despite being an exciting development, much more research is needed.”The energy harvest device needs to be inserted around the heart in open heart surgery, which is more invasive than current practice.This could mean some patients are unsuitable for it.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The lavish honour, for the th anniversary of D-Day, will be the first State Visit by a US President in eight years and could involve a carriage ride with the Queen. But MPs are furious at the decision to roll out the red carpet to a President accused of misogynism, racism and xenophobia.Their motion urges Theresa May to rescind the advice to offer a full state visit to President Trump. It also hits out at Trumpaposs sexist comments about women, his attacks on Londonaposs first Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan , and his failure to tackle climate change.While not legally binding, EDMs are a kind of internal petition for MPs, designed to put moral pressure on the government.     Almost .million people previously signed a now-shut petition asking for Trumpaposs State Visit not to take place.The new bid is being led by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the Home Affairs Committee.He branded the visit bonkers adding: This man is a racist, sexist, extremist who was happy to promote far-right content from Britain First. Not the America I know and love. Not welcome. Mr Doughty said Labour frontbenchers were among those who had signed the motion. The wording is technically addressed to Theresa May, not the Queen who is the person who extends the invitation to the President. However, backers insisted its effect was to cancel the visit. Full wording of the Early Day Motion That this House deplores the record of US President Donald Trump, including his misogynism, racism and xenophobia condemns his previous comments on women, refugees and torture condemns his lack of action on climate change and failure to support the Paris Climate Change Deal condemns his sharing of online content related to a far-right extremist organisation in the UK condemns his comments about the Mayor of London and notes previous motions and debates in the House including on the withholding of the honour of a joint address to the Houses of Parliament further notes the historical signicance and honour that comes with the choice to offer a full state visit to an inidual and calls on the Prime Minister and the Government to rescind the advice to offer a full state visit to President Trump.

Mirror readers are concerned about schools, the homeless, feeding their families, climate change, religious extremism and trying to ensure their kids do not grow up worse off than they are. I suspect they really couldn’t care less about Diane Abbott enjoying a canned mojito on a train last week. Yes, she’s the Shadow Home Secretary, and yes, Transport for London have had an alcohol ban in place since then-London Mayor Boris Johnson announced it in . Abbott broke the law. Yet that law was brought in to address anti-social behavior on public transport. Not -year-old pensioners scrolling through their phones minding their own business. So while Susan Hall, who sits on the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, stamped her feet in indignation along with Tory MPs Paul Scully and Bob Blackman, ordinary Londoners were just not that bothered.  In fact, Diane’s succinctly-worded tweet on Friday night both pre-empted the controversy and acted as a verbal eye-roll. “A photo of me drinking from a can of MS mojito on the Overground has been circulated,” she wrote. “I’m sincerely sorry for drinking on TFL.” Cue the hashtags #istandwithdiane and #jesuisdiane as ordinary people made their feelings clear. “I spent the day defending her even though I’m not a fan” wrote one tweeter. Hundreds either posted cans they’d bought in solidarity or selfies they’d taken on public transport holding them in support.  When Christians are among the many faiths being targeted around the world and this country remains paralysed by Brexit, the last thing on peoples’ minds – left or right – is a politician in need of a cold one on a hot day. Clearly Abbott’s critics haven’t been on a night bus, a late-night weekend tube or the summer District Line from Wimbledon after the tennis when el vino tends to flow. The real issue is the enforceability of that  law, described back then by Transport Union general secretary Bob Crow as “a half-baked gimmick designed as a publicity stunt without a moment’s thought for the people told to implement it.” Let’s hear what Abbott’s critics intend to do about addressing that. In the meantime everyone  is busy getting their priorities right.

Voting is ided into large regions of the country, with each selecting between  and  MEPs using a form of proportional representation. Seats in each region are allotted to each party depending on what share of the regional vote they received.

The Tories are expected to receive a hammering from Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, which has never faced an election before but contains many UKIP defector MEPs. Change UKwill be trying to scoop up the anti-Brexit vote in what is this groupaposs first ballot box test too. Those fringe movements could hit both Labour and the Tories hard, especially becausethe seats are chosen through a form of proportional representation, andEU elections were previously ripe for protest votes. In the last elections in , UKIP won  seats Labour won  the Tories won  and the Greens won . Nigel Farage will be leading the charge for his new Brexit Party, which despite only just setting up has enjoyed polling numbers in the mid-teens. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson and Labour peer Maurice Glasman have warned the elite elite-basher poses a serious threat to Labour. He vowed to put the fear of God into our MPs - they deserve nothing less in comments that led to accusations he was making dog-whistle threats. Lord Buckethead The comedy character is back after becoming a viral internet sensation when he stood against Theresa May in . This time he is planning to stand against Nigel Farage in South East England.Because he is not part of a list he will need to outstrip the might of the big parties to get elected. But he has been boosted by more than £, in crowdfunding - three times what he needed for his £, deposit. Rachel Johnson  Rachel Johnson, the sister of Tory Boris, is to stand for anti-Brexit party Change UK in the South West region. The journalist who has long campaigned against Brexit became the second sister of a prominent Brexiteer to join a new party in as many weeks. Jacob Rees-Moggaposs sister Annunziataalso announced she would stand in the election for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. She took a swipe at her brother, saying she did not want to see Brexit “rubbing out my children’s prospects and chances of living and travelling and working in Europe”. Andrew Adonis The former minister prompted raised eyebrows when he announced he would be standing for Labour - as second choice for the South West Region. The arch-Remain peer is most definitely not following Jeremy Corbynaposs official line on Brexit. He wants to cancel our leaving the EU - saying Brexit can and should be stopped. Steve Bray The man who has yelled stop Brexit at Parliament every sitting day for the last  months is standing for the European Parliament - as an independent, itaposs thought. Steve Bray, known locally as the Stop Brexit Guy, began protesting in Westminster in September , wearing a blue and yellow hat and draped in a Union Flag cape. He started as a lone voice, shouting at the seat of democracy once a day. But as time has gone on, and anti-Brexit sentiment has swelled, so has his group of screaming Remainers, hurling an increasingly y stream of invective at the Palace.  The UKIP candidate refused to apologise for saying he wouldnapost even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips. The -year-old who styles himself aposSargon of Akkadapos even doubled down, saying his comments were justied because sheaposd been a giant bitch. In combative exchanges, Mr Benjamin - who is second on UKIPaposs South West regional list - told journalists: Iaposm not answering your questions, Iaposm not apologising for anything, you dirty, dirty smear merchants.  The isive UKIP leader is almost guaranteed to re-win his seat as heaposs top of the partyaposs list in London. His leadership of the party has prompted an exodus of UKIP stalwarts including Nigel Farage, who said he was pushing it to the far right. He has courted far-right EDL founder Stephen Yaxley-Lennonand defended Carl Benjaminaposs claim he wouldnapost even rape a female MP. Laura Parker The left-winger - fourth on Labouraposs London list - is the most senior woman in the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. That means she is a power player in the partyaposs factional battle between a softer Brexit, none at all, or a second referendum. “If we were staring down the barrel of a no-deal gun, I personally would like to be asked what I thought about that,” she told the BBC last year. Eloise Todd Eyebrows were also raised when the chief of an anti-Brexit group was selected to run for Labour. Eloise Todd - the CEO of second referendum campaign group Best For Britain - will run as second on the list for Labour in Yorkshire and the Humber. Annunziata Rees-Mogg Jacob Rees-Moggaposs SISTER was announced as one of the first candidates for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. Annunziata Rees-Mogg - a former Tory candidate who joined the Conservatives at the age of five - is a privately-educated fox hunting supporter once worked on the Brexiteer journal of Tory MP Bill Cash. The -year-old and her brother Jacob are both hard Brexiteers and were among five children of late newspaper editor William Rees-Mogg. She stood for the Tories aged just  in Aberavon, before falling out with the leadership when she stood again in Somerton and Frome in . David Cameron had suggested she refer to herself as aposNancy Moggapos - because her own name sounded too posh - but she refused. A YouTuber who was fined £ after filming a pug giving a Nazi salute is standing in the European elections for Ukip. Mark Meechan, , who styles himself as Count Dankula on the internet, said he would stand to represent Scotland in the EU. He was handed the fine for recording his girlfriendaposs pet dog, Buddha, responding to statements such as gas the Jews and Sieg Heil by raising its paw. He was found guilty of breaching the Communications Act by posting material that was grossly offensive and anti-Semitic and racist in nature, in an offence aggravated by religious prejudice, following a trial at Airdrie Sherf Court in April last year. He repeatedly refused to pay the fine but had the money seized from his bank account by court officials earlier this year.  Former BBC top dog Gavin Esler branded Brexit Britain a worldwide joke as he confirmed heaposll stand in the London region for Change UK. The ex-Newsnight presenter - who left the BBC two years ago - demanded a second referendum to stop Brexit now. He slammed the pretend men of the people, the posers of Brexit, the Farages and the Rees-Moggs selling the same old snake oil.  He said: I am absolutely appalled, Iaposm sick of it. They claim to speak for the British people. They do not. They stole our patriotism and I want it back.  Ex-MP Katy Clark is a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn as the former political secretary to the Labour leader. She was shunted up to third place in the coveted London list for Labour MEP candidates after a reported battle between factions in the party. As an ally of Labouraposs leader she may introduce a sceptic note among other, far more wildly pro-EU candidates on the partyaposs list. Martin Mayer The Labour candidate shot to prominence after saying he regrets branding anti-Semitism claims a smear to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. Martin Mayer faced anger after an e-mail he sent in  emerged with the title: How Israel lobby manufactured UK Labour partyaposs anti-Semitism crisis. Euan Philipps of the Labour Against Anti-Semitism group said Mr Mayeraposs views have no place in British democracy. Yet Labour sources defended his conduct, saying his remarks are from a few years ago and were not made in the current context.

But Greta Thunberg is no ordinary teenager – to many she’s a superhero. Eight months ago, Greta sat alone outside Sweden’s parliament, brandishing a banner that read “school strike for the climate”. Now the teen activist is responsible for sparking a global movement that has led to .million pupils around the world walking out of school to join her in the fight against climate change. And she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Greta has had ­audiences with the Pope, the UN and the European parliament. At the weekend she told Extinction ­Rebellion activists, who staged protests across London and beyond, they were “making a dference”.Yesterday she sat down with ­Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , Liberal ­Democrat leader Vince Cable and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas in the House of Commons, and the Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts.She arrived in the UK by train, after giving up flying in . There was an empty chair left for Prime Minister Theresa May .Greta’s message is clear – we should be panicking about global warming and it is time for governments to listen to the science. “If your house is on fire then that does require some level of panic. You don’t sit talking about insurance claims and rebuilding – you do everything you can to put out the fire,” she says. “Most emissions are not caused by ­iniduals. They’re caused by corporations and states.” When she addressed MPs in the Attlee Room in Portcullis House it was standing room only – and she wasn’t afraid to take her elders to task.  “Is the microphone really on  Did you hear me  Is my English OK  Because I’m beginning to wonder...” she said. “During the last six months I’ve travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours on trains, electric cars, and buses repeating these le-changing words over and over. “But no one seems to be talking about it and nothing has changed. Emissions are still rising. The basic problem is the same ­everywhere – that nothing is being done to halt, or even slow climate and ecological breakdown, despite all the ­beautul words and promises.” Uncowed by climate change deniers branding her a fearmonger, she has accused politicians and ­corporations of stealing her generation’s future.  “I was fortunate to be born in a time and place where everyone told us to dream big, I could become whatever I wanted to. “Things our grandparents could not even dream of. We had everything we could ever wish for. And yet now we may have nothing. “Now we probably don’t even have a future any more. Because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. It was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit,” she says. She grew up in Stockholm, the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman.  It was a science lesson when she was aged eight that sparked her concern for the planet. “The teachers showed us pictures of starving polar bears and deforestation, plastic in the ocean. I was very moved.” At , Greta says she found herself despairing at the lack of action. “I became very depressed. Nothing was happening. There was no point in anything.” She finally decided the only way to achieve attention for the fight against climate change was to stage a school strike one day a week. Her parents were initially not keen on their daughter missing out on her education. “My parents weren’t fond of it,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.  “But I just kept talking about it and they said, ‘Can’t you do anything   Do you have to skip school to get your message out ’ And I said I was going to do it whether they liked it or not.” The school strikes have since spread around the world, with UK teens joining over the past few months. At the time Greta said: “It’s great England is joining in a major way. People have ­realised just how absurd the situation is. We are in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history and nothing is being done to prevent it.” Like Greta, her mother has given up flying, and her dad has become a vegetarian. He said: “I really didn’t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted. She changed us and now she is changing a great many other people.”She revealed on Twitter she has ­Asperger’s and says it has helped her. “For those of us on the spectrum,” she said, “almost ­everything is black or white. “You can’t be a little sustainable, you’re either sustainable or not.”On Autism Awareness Day she posted to her million followers on social media how she was “proud to be on the ­spectrum”. She wrote: “Under the right ­circumstances, given the right adjustments it CAN be a superpower.  “I’ve had my fair share of depressions, alienation, anxiety and disorders. But without my diagnosis, I would never have started school striking. Because then I would have been like everyone .” In her calm style, Greta told off our ­politicians, saying: “The UK is very special. Not only for its mind-blowing historical carbon debt, but also for its current, very creative, carbon accounting.” Earlier she had explained: “No country is doing nearly enough. Britain has reduced its emissions by % since s levels. But that is not trueyou include all emissions like aviation, shipping, imports and exports.” Mr Gove, perhaps sensing she is the voice of future voters, told her: “The time to act is now, the challenge could not be clearer, Greta you have been heard.” She says she will meet anybody – except the ­President of the United States. “I can’t say anything to Donald Trump that he hasn’t heard before,” she says. “Obviously he’s not listening to the science and to what we have to say, so I wouldn’t be able to change his mind.” Despite finding herself the face of a global climate change movement, she doesn’t see herself as a leader. “Since this is a ­movement, everyone is equally ­important,” she says. “I’ve a lot of responsibility because many people listen to what I have to say. “I’m sure the moment we start behaving aswe were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe.” Only time will tellMPs were listening – and Greta will knowthey are being sincere or not. “I don’t easily fall for lies, I can see through things,” she says.

Parents Sophia Vanhecke and Ben Taylor realised she was coming incredibly early and called  at am in the morning.Just two hours later, Hope-Rose was born at Barnstaple Hospital , weighing just over lb.   Sophia said: She was very, very small. So tiny, but apart from that she looked exactly like my other two children when they were born. We called her Hope because it fit the situation. Then the nurse who looked after her and looked after us on the evening she passed was called Rose, so we hyphenated it. After she was born, Hope-Rose was transferred to the neonatal unit at Derrord Hospital. For the next three days -year-old Sophia and Ben didnapost move from her side while machines kept her alive. On April  the family were offered a private room and Hope-Rose was taken off ventilation. She was laid on her mumaposs chest and, in what seemed like a miracle, started breathing on her own. Sophia, a nail technician, said: At first when she began to breathe on her own, without the ventilator, I was really happy and we thought she was going to the the one-in-a-million miracle baby.    It was about  minutes or half-an-hour later that the consultant came and checked her heart and she had passed. The mum, who also has has two older children, Eden, four, and two-year-old Coen, said one of the hardest parts was telling them. Sophia said: My son is too young to understand. My daughter didnapost actually know I was pregnant at all. And because it all happened in the middle of the night she was told I was unwell because we didnapost really know what was happening with Hope-Rose at first. Once she had passed we told Eden that she had a baby sister but she came too early and was really poorly and died. Eden askedshe could go to see her in the hospital in Plymouth. We asked hershe was sure because Hope-Rose was very cold - but she really wanted to go and see her and cuddle her and say goodbye. Instead of celebrating their daughteraposs birth, the couple are now planning her funeral.  And they have a very special request for anyone who sees her funeral cortege - to blow a kiss. Sophia said: I am struggling now. Planning the funeral helps. Although we are having a private funeral in Wrafton, we will have a horse-drawn carriage taking her to the Barnstaple crematorium. I want to ask that anybody who sees the horse-drawn carriage blows her a kiss as she passes. And Sophia also wants to raise awareness of the amazing work of the neonatal team, who she believes could have saved her babythey had been alerted earlier. She said: I want to raise awareness - I donapost think people here speak about or know enough about neonatal death. Also I want to set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the neonatal team. All of the staff at the neonatal intensive care unit at Plymouth Derrord were absolutely outstanding. Words could never describe. The nurses there were Hope-Roseaposs family and always will be. It was sad because I went into labour at home at one in the morning. I dialled  and an ambulance came and took me to AE. I told them I was in labour but they didnapost believe me. For two hours I was saying I need to push.  Because I already have two children I knew I was in labour. I actually gave birth to her in Barnstaple AE. I wasnapost examined by a doctor until quarter of an hour before she was born and he said aposthe babyaposs comingapos. There was no specialist doctor there and no specialist equipment. They called for the specialist neonatal team from Derrord but in the time it took them to drive down they had to resuscitate her three times. The thing that really upsets me is that the consultant saidthe circumstances were dferent a baby born at  weeks - with the right equipment and the right specialist staff - has a  per cent of survival. If they had listened to me when I said I was in labour, they would have had time to get the neonatal team to Barnstaple. It was enough time. Hope-Rose was born without the right environment or staff or equipment. Because of that she had the worst chance of survival. When the Plymouth team arrived they knew exactly what they were doing - they were absolutely amazing. The hardest thing for me is that nobody listened to me. I threw myself on the floor in pain. I knew I was in labour. The pain was excruciating. I kept saying I needed to push and the paramedic said I didnapost need to push it was an infection. The family now plan to set up a JustGiving page to raise funds for the neonatal team.Sophia told Devon Live : All of the staff at the neonatal intensive care unit at Plymouth Derrord were absolutely outstanding. Words could never describe.The nurses there were Hope-Roseaposs family and always will be. Professor Adrian Harris, medical director at Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust, said: “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to Sophia and Ben for the tragic loss of Hope-Rose. “We are dedicated to providing safe, high-quality care to our patients with compassion, and as with any incident of this nature we will be conducting a full investigation to establish what happened and identy any learning that we need to act on. “We will work with the family during the investigation and will share our full report with them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bm glass table shatters over","story":"NewsBM glass table shatters all over mum and baby minutes after being assembledNeil Hancox paid £ for the table which is part of the Alfresco Living range - but claims it shattered and left his we and -month-old girl covered in broken glassShareCommentsByEmilia Bona:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsNeil Hancox had bought the table he claims shattered over his we and baby \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA BM glass table shattered all over a mum and -month-old baby just minutes after being assembled, it is claimed.

Chances are most of what you’ll find in the recesses of your fridge will end up in the bin. Last year we threw away . million tons of food. Of this, five million tons was still edible. That is the equivalent of £million worth of food each week, according to new research conducted by recipe box company Gousto for Stop Food Waste Day. Confusing food labels such as “once opened” instructions, are inconsistent and unclear as to whether they are recommendations on food safety or quality –contributing to food waste. But also simply turning down the temperature in your fridge can help to keep food fresher. Three-quarters of us run our fridges too warm – a move which could prevent up to . million of tonnes from being dumped and save each family a small fortune. So what temperature should your fridge be and which shelves are best for what foods  Read are guide on how to cut down on food waste. It is better for the environment and your pocket too. What is the correct temperature for a fridge    Experts say the optimum overall temperature is between c and c. Aside from food going off before its best-before date, there are several warning signs that your fridge is at the wrong temperature. Modern appliances have a built-in thermometer with some activating an alarmthe temperature drops below or above the optimum range. Condensation on the inside walls means it is too warm as the fridge’s gas is being turned into liquid, which may contaminate food on the lower shelves. If it’s too cold, ice maybe visible at the back. This could also be caused by a faulty door allowing warm air from the outside into the fridge. Donapost overfill the fridge  The more stuffed your fridge shelves become, the harder it is to keep cool. Experts recommend turning down the thermostat by one degreeit is packed. But an empty fridge is not efficient either. To prevent the fridge getting too cold, place a couple of jugs of water on a shelf to fill up space. Or you can turn the temperature setting up a notch. Ideally, a fridge should be around three-quarters full to allow cold air to circulate. Embrace your freezer Many of the items in our fridges will be suitable for home-freezing, which can extend their shelf le massively. It doesn’t have to be on the day of purchase either, just as long as it is before the use-by date. Portion control Avoid cooking too much by sticking to recommended serving sizes listed on packaging.

George Beauchamp is the only person to escape alive from the two worst maritime disasters of the th century. Relatives have revealed how he first survived the Titanic in  and then the Lusitania in . After his second brush with death, he told his family: I have had enough of large ships - Iaposm going to work on smaller boats. George was working as a fire stoker below deck when the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean on April  .  He recalled hearing a roar like thunder on impact and was up to his waist in seawater before being permitted to leave the engine room. He then went up an escape ladder on to deck and helped frantic passengers into a “crowded” leboat before getting in himself. He later told the British Inquiry into the disaster how he helped up to  passengers into Leboat Number . Talking about the impact, he explained he was keeping he engines fuelled at the time: I noticed the shock and then a roar like thunder. We were ordered to close the dampers as water poured through over the plates. We climbed up the escape ladder. “  About helping passengers into the leboat, he told them: I had one foot on the deck and one on the leboat and I was helping ladies and children into the leboat. He explained: “The order was given, aposThat will do that is enough for that boat,apos and I stepped into the boat and went away with it. He told how some ladies had refused to get in the leboat. We had dficulty keeping the leboat away from the shipaposs side and prevent water coming in,” he told the inquiry. We pulled on the oars to get away as far as possible from the suction of the ship as it went down. I saw the ship go down bow first and I could still see the stern and then that went too. It was a roar like thunder as it went down and I heard cries as the ship sank. We would have gone back for others but we were full up. They were picked up ten minutes later by the rescue ship the RMS Carpathia, which saved  people fleeing the doomed ocean liner. Following that ordeal London-born George, remained at sea and is believed to have been on board the RMS Lusitania - when it was sunk during WW. The Lusitania, once the worldaposs largest passenger ship, was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May , , as the Nazis waged war on Britain off the coast of Ireland. His incredible story has come about now as his family, who are from Hull, East Yorks, bid to pay tribute  years after his death.  His great granddaughter, Susan Norton, said: “My mum is quite annoyed that my dad has never really got a mention. It seemed only the officers’ stories are ever told. “I am proud of my great granddad and the part in he played in saving the lives of some passengers.” George was born in London and moved to Hull, where he spent ten years working on trawlers and other ships. He married and had a family in the city before taking a job with White Star Line and travelling to Southampton, Hants, for the Titanicaposs maiden voyage.

On the one hand you donapost want to be the sort of person who stays away and doesnapost acknowledge whataposs happened. But the risk of saying the wrong thing can be terrying.To help with this matter,  The Miscarriage Association have created a range of empathy cards to send to any parent going through a miscarriage.Comprising of four cards, they each feature a simple and heartfelt message on the front.  One example reads, Thereaposs no good card for this. Iaposm so sorry for your loss. To ensure the cards struck the right chord, a  of woman who had themselves gone through pregnancy loss approved them. Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, said of the empathy cards: Shockingly, greetings card retailers stock a card for almost every important le event, except one. These cards recognise miscarriage, and give words to those friends and loved ones who can’t find them.    Losing a pregnancy is heart-breaking and can be very lonely. Close family and friends often don’t know what to say, say the wrong thing, or just say nothing at all. The new cards have been launched to fill that gap. They may even become a treasured memento, the acknowledgement of the briefest of lives.The miscarriage empathy cards are available now at  Postmark aposs London stores and online, and Postmark is donating all proceeds from them to The Miscarriage Association."},{"url":null,"title":"parents laying bed heard horror","story":"NewsParents laying in bed heard horror crash which killed teen son near their homeDylan Campbell, , was killed in Leicester after he was hit by speeding Audi driver, Shankar ModhwadiaShareCommentsByAbigail OLearySuzy Gibson:,  APR NewsDylan was crossing the road to get cash to pay for a friends taxi at the time of tragic incident \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParents laying in bed heard the car crash which killed their son as he crossed a road near their home.

Kodie Richardsonaposs outburst terried fellow travellers on the flight about to set off from Manchester Airport for Turkey, a court heard.A six-year-old girl and even one member of the cabin crew were left in tears by the incident, the Manchester Evening News reports.The captain who was taxiing to the runway aborted the scheduled departure and turned back to the terminal to ask police to remove Richardson, , and her mum Kelly Meadowcroft - who was also drunk, a judge was told. But Richardson refused to leave her seat before abusing and attacking three police officers who boarded the aircraft to remove her. She even kicked one of them in the face. Now the mother and daughter, both from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, are facing jail sentences.    The drama started moments before Thomas Cook Airlines flight MT to Antalya in Turkey had pushed back from Terminal  at about .pm on September  last year. After taking her seat, Richardson asked fellow passengers for a cigarette and threatened to knock out one crew member while she and her mother Kelly Meadowcroft, , were seen swigging from an open bottle of duty free spirit and disrupted the safety briefing, the court heard. Richardson aimed a volley of foul-mouthed abuse at police when they were called, upsetting fellow passengers. Prosecutor Haseeb Yousaf told Manchesteraposs Minshull Street Crown Court on Tuesday the captain decided to turn the aircraft around as it taxied towards the runway and radioed for police officers to remove two passengers because of their aposunruly behaviour and drunkennessapos. When the aircraft ed to the stand, officers boarded and asked passengers not to take footage as they tried to remove the two women. But aposvery drunkapos Richardson began to scream at the police officers, refusing to leave her seat while her also inebriated mother aposstruggled to put a sentence togetherapos, the court was told. Richardson, who was aposlashing out and thrashing aroundapos, was eventually removed from her seat and taken out of the rear of the plane. She continued to be abusive after being handcuffed and resisted attempts to load her into the cage at the rear of a police van.    Her mother had been aposunsteady on her feet and was slurring her wordsapos, said Mr Yousaf. Three police constables were hurt as Richardson lashed out, the court was told. One officer suffered a cut lip after being kicked in the face while a second suffered a deep cut to a finger. The court heard the abuse continued in the back of the police van, with Richardson telling officers: You fing bitch. I will make sure you are crying you fing c. Some of her comments were too vile to publish. Delayed, the flight was able to resume its journey to Turkey - minus the mother and daughter. When she was finally interviewed at the airport police station, apologetic Richardson told officers aposIaposm sorryapos and claimed she hadnapost intended to assault the officers. The court heard Richardson only had one caution for theft on her record while her mother had  crimes to her name, including for violence. Police bodycam footage was played to the court, showing Richardsonaposs rant at the police officers. Frequently screaming and shouting, she is heard to tell them: Iaposve not done nothing wrong. Iaposm not getting off. With all due respect, Iaposm going to Turkey and my dad has just died. I want to go away. I want to go on my holiday.

The court heard his client was aposarticulate and cogentapos and that she had apologised as soon as she was interviewed by officers. This was clearly out of character, said Mr Edwards, who added his client has suffered aposdficultiesapos in her le.

Mr Edwards told the court his client, when abusing one member of the cabin crew, had blasted aposyour perfect le with your mum and dadapos.

Mark Hatch, , exchanged the shocking messages with -year old Robin Hollyson during which Hollyson sent film of himself sexually abusing the five-month-old boy. During the exchanges, Hatch gloated about watching the explicit video and said: aposaposGod love being a pedo with other nasty pedo pervs.aposapos In one message he told Hollyson: You get plenty of perv action. Me and you together - canapost wait. I wanna become a proper perv. And Manchester Evening News says during his responses Hollyson, who worked in IT, told Hatch: aposaposHis nd birthday will be a free for all.aposapos The youngster was subsequently raped by two other friends of Hollyson.  The horrying chat log which took place between October  and March  was found on Hatchaposs i-Phone, laptop and an i-Pad when police raided his home in June  following an investigation into a paedophile ring run by Hollyson. In other messages Hatch had told Hollyson he had an interest to stalking young lads and pick one out to catch and rape. More than  indecent images were found on Hatchaposs computer at his home in Middleton, Greater Manchester. Hatch since admitted encouraging Hollyson to commit sex offences, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and distributing indecent images and was jailed for six years and eight months. Sentencing Hatch, Judge Stuart Driver QC said: The content on your devices show you to be a man with a deep seated sexual interest in young and very young boys. You fantasised about raping them and subjecting them to violence, you said you would like to join a paedophile ring. You received a video of Hollyson actually raping the baby yet your response was complete approval. You encouraged him to do it again, to do more to rape and to arrange what you called a group abuse session. After your criminal encouragement Hollyson went on to arrange the rape of the same child by the two other men.    However it is important that this court keeps in perspective, the fact that Hollyson would have gone on to commit those offences without your encouragement - and you declined repeatedly invitations to travel to meet him. Nevertheless the fact that you knew this man had raped that child and you encouraged further rapes and believed that that would happen, you encouraged those terrible crimes. You will require professional help to deal with your sexual impulses which were so deep rooted back then that one can only imagine that they still exist and will continue for the rest of your le. Hollyson was jailed for  years in September  for conspiracy to rape but hanged himself in jail the following January. He had been one of the masterminds behind a gang of seven paedophiles who raped babies, toddlers and pre-school children and streamed the abuse over the internet. The court heard Hatch had engaged in ious conversations with Hollyson via Skype and all related to the baby. During the chats Hollyson, of Luton, Bedfordshire, admitted previously abusing the boy, and Hatch asked for pictures following which he made a series of grotesquely explicit remarks.  When Hatch failed to attend a meeting, Hollyson referred to booking a aposaposhotel full of pervsaposapos and said: didn’t you fancy a shot at his cherry and Hatch replied Of course I do. Inquiries revealed Hollyson had invited Hatch to a meeting so he could rape the baby - but Hatch had declined saying he had a job interview. The court heard Hatch had also had a sexualised online conversation with a  year old boy from the USA during which the lad was asked to strip in front of a webcam. He also claimed to have assaulted a boy aged  at Stockport bus station and abused another boy aged just eight. Mr Alaric Bassano, prosecuting, said: aposaposThere were a total of  online chats with  dferent males from  – .  aposaposIn the course of these conversations the defendant made explicit revelations about depraved sexual and violent acts he wanted to commit or wanted to see committed against children. He expressed a wish to watch young children being raped and to rape young children himself. aposaposIn several chats this included raping toddlers and babies, including new born babies and he expressed an interest in joining a paedophile ring. In three chats the defendant said he would like to see and even commit “rape and snuff” however the Crown accepts in these conversations he was engaging in sexual and violent fantasies without an intention or belief that the acts would be carried out. aposaposHis offending also fell short of conspiracy. He declined all invitations to attend to commit substantive offences against the child or to aid and abet others to do so at the scene and he did not assist in the commission of such offences. Hollyson evidently needed little or no encouragement. aposaposHowever the defendant was made aware that Hollyson had raped and was intending to gang rape the baby. He could have alerted the police to protect the boy from further harm. Instead, he chose to wilfully encourage the very offences which Hollyson and others went on to commit, believing that this would be so.aposapos Robert Golinski, defending, said: aposaposThis is understandably a case which one might approach immediately with revulsion. His actions, words, and communications not only with Hollyson but with others are truly appalling. But his le was initially engaging in fantasy, and within that fantasy there was a great deal of invention. aposaposThe internet is a wonderful thing but the need to engage in this sort of fantasy and encourage what is a very dangerous thing and for this defendant it led him beyond fantasy and he was engaging with a very serious sexual offender. Hollysonaposs paedophile ring of seven men carried out sickening attacks across the UK. One of the fiends, Christopher Knight, worked at OutdoorLads, a social group for gay and bisexual men, for around five years until he was suspended. The balding -year-old admitted one count of rape of a child under , two counts of conspiracy to rape a child under , two counts of sexual assault of a child under , and one count of taking, showing, or possessing indecent images of children.

When the royals lined up at the entrance to St Georgeaposs Chapel he could be seen leaning over to chat to Kate .

In one post, Codrington is pictured emerging from crystalline waters surrounded by native New Zealand ferns in the photo.She tagged the location of the Instagram snap simply as New Zealand, with the caption: Just me surrounded by nature - the way I like it, along with a plug for the paua-shell necklaces she is selling online.Kiwis were quick to pile into the postaposs comments section, claiming to recognise the spot as Te Waihou Blue Spring, in the countryaposs North Island. The spring has a swimming ban because its internet fame saw it swamped by visitors. Swimming in the fragile South Waikato habitat has been banned since  due to the aposnegative impact on the vegetation in the riverbed and on the banks, as well as the visual amenity.apos Please NEVER swim there. That spring is sacred, one commenter wrote on the Instagram post. But  Codrington denied swimming in the spring, and hit back against commenters, who also criticised her for advertising her jewellery collection in tags on the post. She and her boyfriend, fellow Instagrammer Mitch Cox, claimed they had been swimming in another river at a popular hiking location more than km away in the Bay of Plenty region. This was at the Tarawera falls River NOT Blue Springs, Ms Codrington wrote on Instagram. I didnapost want to reveal the location because Iaposm a big believer in preserving the hidden gems and the environment, not all places should be geotagged. The last thing the environment needs is another overpopulated hotspot. So-called apostravel influencersapos have attracted criticism in New Zealand, which has traded on its % Pure natural beauty in past tourism marketing campaigns. Despite the marketing of its crystal-clear waters and green mountain ranges, the health of its waterways is diminishing. Environmentalists blame commercial water-bottling activities and intensive dairy farming. While some are pleased at the tourism influencersapos promotion of New Zealand - others are uncomfortable at the effects of the boost in tourism on New Zealandaposs environment. Some Kiwis criticise Instagrammers for highlighting hidden beautyspots to huge followings, claiming the crowds bring extra strain on already fragile native eco-systems, and disturb signicant Maori sites.   That tension was apparent when commenters noticed another shot of  Codrington at a Mermaid Pools, a natural infinity pool on Aucklandaposs coastline.The NZ Herald reports the pools are on land owned by  families - some of whom use the water for drinking.The popularity  beautyspots, like Blue Springs, have forced local authorities to impose restrictions as visitors descend in hordes eager to imitate the picturesque snaps of Instagram stars.

The horric experience happened at an unnamed plastic surgery clinic in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. The woman in her s is said to have been unaware as her skin was burnt from the inside out during the much sought-after a ‘Thermage’ treatment. The face-tightening procedur relies on heating deep layers of the patient’s skin to stimulate collagen, according to the Calornia-based company Thermage.    However, after an hour of the treatment, the patient was sent home and reportedly began experiencing sharp pain on her face, followed by burn blisters. She took herself to hospital and was shocked to learn she had suffered second-degree burns during the treatment. She was put in intensive care for three weeks as a result.    Doctor Lin Shang-li, who runs the Shang-Li Dermatologic and Aesthetic Clinic in Taiwan’s northern New Taipei City, said the patient came to him for help after her traumatic ordeal. Lin said of the woman’s experience: “More often than not, it’s caused by the strength of the treatment.  “If the patient was under general anaesthesia during the procedure, she wouldn’t have been able to give the surgeons feedback in real time, she continued. “She wouldn’t have been able to tell them whether it hurt or not, leading to over-treatment and eventually burn injuries.”  Lin said he would be treating the woman’s face, which is covered in dark scars from her burn wounds. However, due to her burn injuries, she will need to wait at least two to three months before undergoing any new procedures.

That’s the reality of it and we are going to have to do that,” said Jim.“We’ll keep trying, we will keep digging. We’ve let ,, or whatever it was, punters down who were giving us good backing.“Obviously, when the first goal goes in they vent their fury and they’ve got every right because it has not been good enough.“I fully understand where they’re coming from and we take it squarely on the chin.”Jim conceded yet again it was a case of players not doing their jobs as Saints cantered to an easy win thanks to second-half efforts from Scott Tanser and Callum Hendry.“Once the first goal goes in, obviously it was dficult. Again we were on the ball in the middle of the park and give it away. Then we give away the free-kick.The second goal comes from a throw-in which is again not matching a runner. It’s a simple throw-in back to the wide player and it’s a simple cross and it’s not good enough.“That’s not doing your jobs and it’s jobs that we work on, jobs that they know exactly what’s expected of them in those key areas and that’s why we’ve been punished.“It’s a major disappointment. We were so guilty of giving the ball away in key areas.“I felt we showed a lack of quality on the ball and St Johnstone fed off it, the amount of times they picked the ball up from a slack pass from us and broke.”"},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside look at Emiratesrsquo huge and luxurious ldquosuperjumbo jet

supporters had to wait more than  years to celebrate a win over Rangers in Glasgow – now defender Scott McKenna aims to deliver four in one season.The Dons travel to Ibrox on Sunday gunning for a fourth victory over the Gers on the road.Victory would be unlikely to stop Rangers finishing ahead of Aberdeen in the race to finish second in the Premiership.However, it would complete a memorable clean sweep over an expensively-assembled Rangers side on their own turf, while also effectively securing European qualication for the Dons.Aberdeen have knocked Rangers out of both domestic trophies this term with wins in Glasgow and also triumphed - in the Premiership, with McKenna scoring the vital winner.Now he is desperate to deliver the quadruple over Rangers in their home city.McKenna, . said: “We have a fantastic record at Ibrox this season, as we have won twice there.“It is always a dficult place to go but we have proven to ourselves that we can win at Ibrox. We will be looking to do the exact same again on Sunday.”The Dons had to endure a wait of almost  years to secure a victory at Ibrox since a - success in September .In the interim period there had been one solitary win in Glasgow, defeating Rangers - in the League Cup semi-final in October  on the way to lting the trophy under Roy Aitken.At Ibrox that long drought stretched to  failed attempts until Derek McInnes led the Dons to a - win in May .It was a catalyst that led to the Reds’ impressive form in Glasgow against a Rangers side rebuilt by Steven Gerrard this season at a cost in excess of £ million.Scotland cap McKenna said: “We don’t get caught up with the crowd or the atmosphere . We just deal with the game that is in front of us and in previous encounters we have come out on top.”Victory at Ibrox would not only take Aberdeen a step closer to European qualication for a sixth successive season, it could also ensure Celtic, who host Kilmarnock  hours earlier, can win the title this weekend.That would prevent the possibility of the Hoops bidding to secure the title at Pittodrie the following Saturday.McKenna is only concerned with moving the Dons closer to confirming a third-placed finish and automatic spot.He said: “We have been in Europe for a number of years now and it is up to us as players to make sure the club continues getting there.“We still have four of the best teams in the league to play but over the course of the season we have done pretty well against them in those games. We just have to use our experience from games previously in the season and pick up points.”McKenna headed home the goal as Aberdeen defeated Kilmarnock - to leap-frog the Rugby Park side into third.In an ill-tempered match, Killie had three players sent off. After Aberdeen had two players red-carded and both boss Derek McInnes and No. Tony Docherty sent to the stand in the - Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic, McKenna insists it was vital they kept their cool amid the chaos at Killie.He said: “It was a bit of a battle and there probably wasn’t much football played. After last weekwe had to keep our discipline, as we couldn’t afford to lose any more players.“We battled away and managed to get three points in the end.“It was a massive result for us. “Hearts lost earlier in the day and with us winning it moved us  points clear of them.”Centre-back McKenna scored his second goal of the season with the winner at Kilmarnock.His other goal secured a - Premiership win at Ibrox on December .He said: “I should probably have scored a couple in the first half against Kilmarnock.“I put one wide and did not get enough contact on another.“The balls into the box were excellent and gave us a real chance of attacking them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb9e0028a67e3.92278824.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet base star and daisy are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This whirlwind of excitement and energy is Base!

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

A bank spokeswoman said: “We have submitted applications to make enhancements to our Bank of Scotland Ayr branch. “It’s a bit early in the process to be able to confirm what the exact improvements will be, as we are awaiting ious approvals required.” The bank has lodged plans to create a new strongroom that will contain four cash machines. Three cash machines to the right of the front door will be pulled out. Two will be placed on the other side of the entrance, along with two which are only accessible from the inside. The creation of this new secure area will mean another disabled access ramp has to be put in. New furniture and finishes will be incorporated throughout the banking hall.

An alarmed grandfather heard his nine-year-old grandson shout for help at the Ayr seafront playpark. The wee boy had gone for a shot on the £, tower complex, which has several chutes. But canoodling teens made the youngster climb over a ledge to get past them. And then they pushed him down the chute, prompting his cry for help. Grandfather Alex Kelly, who is chairman of South Ayrshire Crime Prevention Panel, said: “It was Saturday night about  o’clock and we had been for chips in Ayr. “My grandson wanted to go down to the seafront for a shot on the new tower. “I thought I would just stay in the car and let him go ahead but I could see there were a few teenagers, aged  or , hanging about. “My grandson was off and running and away up the inside of the tower. “The next thing I knew he was shouting for help at the bottom of a chute.” Alex added: “He told me what had happened and I wasn’t too happy. “I also saw a dad take his wee girl from inside the tower as she was intimidated by the older kids on it. “I didn’t want to confront the teenagers but I did phone the council. I don’t think it’s acceptable to let teenagers intimidate children in these circumstances. “There should be some kind of supervision that doesn’t involve the police, although the council seems to think the police should be involved.” Alex, of Maybole, reckons there were six young teenagers at the top of the tower, three boys and three girls. He said: “In the good old days we had park keepers to deal with this kind of thing.” A council spokesman said: We are happy that our play parks are popular, but anyone using them should act responsibly. There are plenty of places for parents, s and carers to supervise their children in the play park.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"dynamite plan give ayr great","story":"NewsDynamite plan to give Ayr a great futureAll sorts of buildings such as Matalan, Odeon and Waterfront pub would come downShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBack in use - the old rail bridge would become an inner ring road \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA radical plan to rescue Ayr town centre has been published – and it’s sure to provoke astonishment. That’s exactly what the creators of the Bruce Plan want in a bid to stimulate a real future for the stricken town. The #AyrDeservesBetter campaign want people to sign up to the cause for real action. And Rob Close, chief writer of the -page document, said: “We want real action not yet another expensive consultant’s report. “We have written this for free – now we want our elected leaders to actually do something.” The details of the Bruce Plan – named after King Robert who routed English troops from Ayr – can only now be revealed. The controversial idea, devised by Rob, a Mastermind contestant and Radio  Brain of Britain finalist, involves flattening buildings throughout the centre. And that includes working businesses: ● Matalan ● Mr Basrai’s World Cuisines ● The Odeon ● Sports Direct ● The Tam o’Shanter petrol station ● The Waterfront bar restaurant Wrecking balls will also be brought in to demolish the old Orient cinema Babylon nightclub. This is a key part of the new inner ring road which would utilise the old rail bridge over the River Ayr and replace a traffic system regarded as bonkers. The railway station would finally be annexed from the old hotel and built several hundred yards south at the old Townhead yard. The group see this as “critical” to the future of Ayr. It is thought Network Rail would favour this as certain s at present cannot take the extra long trains now required on the route. The bus station would be relocated to the Matalan Sports Direct site.And the Stagecoach bus station would become part of a new culturalquarter.Rob Close, an historian and architectural author, is working closely with architect Pat Lorimer, the spokesman for #AyrDeservesBetter. Rob said: “I appreciate some may disagree and that I have made no attempt to cost it. “But the cost of doing nothing and allowing the town to crumble in the face of unrelated decisions by successive South Ayrshire Council administrations is much more of a risk – financially, socially and aesthetically. “I feel this plan begins to look like a town that many more of us will want to live in. “People can have a go at itthey wish, but at least it gives us something to focus minds on.” The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think-tank of Ayr partisans. Miller Road and Fort Street would become part of the inner ring road, with the historic Sandgate largely access only. This ring would slice through the Orient cinema site, cut through the Aldi car park, the Waterside bar and into Fort Street. Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre. Unlike some towns there are physical constraints such as the river, bridges and railway line that cannot be moved.The #ADB advocates the entire bottomend of the High Street no longer beinga shopping area, and all businessesclustered from the centre towards the top of the town, anchored by the Ayr CentralMall.Businesses in Miller Road including LA Bowl would be encouraged to relocate to the central core and for it to become largely residential again. South Ayrshire Council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. The group proposes the Station Hotel becomes council offices and the railway buildings on the other side of the track to become social enterprises. #AyrDeservesBetter say the town centre developed piecemeal over the past  years without an overal plan. With  empty shops and buildings there is now need to have compression rather than an expansive retail area.Matalan or even Marks  Spencercould become tenants in the Hourstons building.Details of the Bruce Plan also call for no methadone prescriptions in the town centre. A free bus would operate to include the river and seafront and parking for the first three hours would be free. Extra parking could be created on the old Afflecks factory via Sandgate. It is mooted a public competition to re-design Burns Statue Square after the Odeon and Burns House are brought down.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"new 40m leisure centre ayr","story":"NewsA new £m leisure centre for Ayr High Street will open in Arran Mall is earmarked for flagship facilityShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new £ million leisure centre for Ayr High Street is due to open in  the council has revealed.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: other. “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday.

The event involved a successful partnership between South Ayrshire Council, Scottish Rowing, University of West of Scotland and Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. And it’s believed to be the first time in  years that an organised water-based activity has taken place on the River Ayr. The event was designed to encourage young people to interact safely with the river and get fit and active at the same time. Many of the participants will be undertaking Duke of Edinburgh Gold Awards in the summer and this event was the perfect warm-up. All the young adults were given a safety briefing by representatives from Scottish Rowing, the council and South Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. They were then allocated their equipment before the group all had the opportunity to try out a single scull, open canoe and a costal boat, setting off along an m course. During the day they all received expert tuition from experienced rowers and instructors. Belmont Academy pupil Alex Crooks, aged , said: “It was something new, a new experience. “I’m doing canoeing for my Duke of Edinburgh award, so it’s about getting experience of the water and the river. I enjoyed it.” Ben Gilmour, aged , a pupil at Prestwick Academy, said: “It was good. “We get out and do free things and it’s good way to spend your time, instead of playing the X-Box! “I do sailing and I do figure skating but I’ve never come out and done loads of watersports . “This has been good and you get to meet new people as well.” It’s hoped that the programme will spark renewed interest in rowing and watersports, given the River Ayr’s proximity to Ayr Academy. Backing the event was the RNLI , who through their Respect the Water campaign, were able to reinforce the key messages about staying safe. The participants were also given a waterproof mobile phone cover, along with literature about water safety, as a thank-you for taking part. Tess Crooks who goes to Belmont Academy said: “It was a fun and enjoyable day, I would like to do more and get to learn new skills on the water.” Ryan Matthews, an apprentice from GE Caledonian, said: “It was a very enjoyable experience and good training for my DofE Gold canoeing expedition later in the summer. “It also made me realise the fitness required for this type of activity and how I need to get fitter.” Councillor William Grant, Children and Young People Portfolio Holder for South Ayrshire Council, said: “South Ayrshire has outstanding natural resources available to everyone. “This is a great way for young people to explore nature, increase their confidence and learn new skills at the same time. “We need to respect all our waterways but rivers should also be enjoyed and the young people taking part clearly had a great time thanks to the expert supervision.” Vincent McWhirter, RNLI Volunteer Community Safety Officer said: “We have  miles of coast line from Barassie to Ballantrae with four main rivers and numerous lochs all of which are very attractive but can also be potentially dangerous, so it was really worthwhile to teach the young people new skills and at the same time learn about the hazards but in a fun way.” If you are interested in taking up rowing, you can contact Scottish Rowing https:www.scottish-rowing.org.uk , Ayrshire Coastal Rowing Clubs: Troon

authority has to provide the capital funding itself.Martin Joyce, the councilrsquos service director for assets and infrastructure, presented the report to the committee.He said: ldquoEyemouth is facing signicant capacity issues, in addition to the ious condition and suitability issues, and is currently operating at  per cent of capacity.ldquoThis is projected to rise over the next five years with a concomitant rise in the high school role which has also seen recent increases.ldquoAccordingly, it is proposed that Eyemouth Primary School is considered as the next immediate primary school investment proposal and it is recommended that a full design process and costings begin immediately to ensure this can be progressed as a priority while funding discussions continue with Scottish Government.ldquoIn the event, however, that Scottish Borders Council has to fully fund the capital cost of Eyemouth Primary School, this would have the consequential impact of delaying the construction of the replacement Earlston Primary School.However, Mr Joyce confirmed thatsufficient funding can be acquired for both schools then the two projects would be progressed ldquoin parallel, and in a similar manner to Broomlands and Langlee Primary Schools.The condition and suitability of each primary school has been ranked as lsquopoorrsquo by the council, meaning that the buildings have major defects and are not operating optimally.While both schools have poor facilities, Eyemouth Primary is at a much fuller capacity than Earlston, with Eyemouth consistently sitting at round  per cent capacity over the last ten years, compared to Earlston averaging at  per cent.Furthermore, while Earlston Primary School has had a stable number of pupils over the last few years, Eyemouthrsquos pupil roll has risen from  per cent of capacity to  per cent since .East Berwickshire councillor Carol Hamilton, who acts as the authorityrsquos executive member for children and young people, said:

patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

Some of it went to him... It was a matter of admission that he attended meetings at which the loans were discussed, agreed and authorised.ldquo[Ms Ahmed-Sheikh] claimed to have accepted [his] assertion that the monies borrowed by the practice belonged to him.ldquoIn the tribunalrsquos view she should certainly have appreciated the true position when she had been informed of the background to the establishment of the trust and was a trustee of the client trust.ldquoShe failed to consider the matter even when the firm started borrowing from the trust. She must have known this borrowing was essential to the viability of the firm. This is particularly serious in light of her position of Cashroom Manager. The lack of investigation and inquiry into these most basic facts is a signicant failing. It said the pair ldquocompletely failed to apply their minds to the status of the funds and the nature of the relationship of the Trust with the firm.ldquoIt would have been obvious from the firm balance sheet that the firm was being supported by loans from the Trust. The Respondents were Trustees of that Trust.The tribunal went on: ldquoIn financially dficult times, when the practice unit [the firm] was living day-to-day, and the loans were required to pay staff salaries, all partners and the Cashroom Manager in particular should have been examining the accounts of both the trust and the practice unit very carefully,for no other reason that to satisfy themselves that loans could continue to be madethe practice unitrsquos finances did not improve.ldquoTo continue for so many years without making any investigation into the trustrsquos status was a serious and reprehensible departure from the standards of competent and reputable solicitors.ldquoIt appeared to the tribunal that they had completely failed to consider the matter and their responsibilities.The tribunal said the financial records for the trust were ldquoin such disarray it was impossible to tellit even had a positive balance in the relevant period, though all loans have since been repaid.The Tribunal also rejected the solicitorsrsquo argument that they had not breached any rules about borrowing because the trust was ldquoin the business of lending money.It said: ldquoThere was no evidence that the Trust was lsquoin businessrsquo, for example tax liability or registration.. the only loans the Trust made were to the practice unit [the firm].ldquoThe practice unit borrowed money from the Trust. The loans were essential for the viability of the firm. The Respondents were both Trustees of the Trust and managers of the practice unit.

It is now accepted on all sides that in the words of the Tribunal there lsquowas no suggestion of dishonesty or lack of integrityrsquo.ldquoThe case turned on whether I should have realised that the family Trust in the name of my senior partner Mr Mickel, to which there was no financial loss, should be treated as a client of the firm. The Law Society accepted my view at the time was lsquowrongly held but genuinersquo.ldquoI, in turn, accept that my view was mistaken in the terms of the Law Society Rules.

First, remember Enoch Powellrsquos edict that ldquopower devolved is power retained, so, from the start, devolution was not what it was cracked up to be. The economy is a matter retained to Westminster, yet when Scottish economic figures are disadvantageous, successive Scottish Secretaries have challenged successive Holyrood First Ministers about what they are going to do about it ndash but when the figures are favourable, that was due to that actions of Westminster governments. In the post-war years, they had poured extra money into Scotland to thwart the rise of the SNP, but the much-praised Barnett formula under-funded our block grant from the straight population ratio basis of year-on-year enhancements. Except that the - Conservative government put more in that the formula allowed, so our  per cent per capita lead remained instead of being reduced to single figures, giving the impression that Barnett was responsible, thus enhancing the case for devolution.Unionist MPs for English constituencies at Westminster, even those born in Scotland, used Scottish Questions to ask for how long their voters were going to have to continue to subsidise ldquothese Jocks from their taxation  When UK welfare measures were implemented, we had imposed on us the so-called bedroom tax . That was not required here, as traditionally, the problem was solved by voluntary exchanges to suit new circumstances. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson challenged Nicola Sturgeon, thatshe was not content, to remedy the situation . When the SNP raised income tax to cover it, it was met with a torrent of abuse from Ms Davidsonrsquos own party for ldquomaking Scotland the highest tax-paying region of the UK, even though the Conservatives were instrumental in ldquogranting Holyrood the extra tax powers in the first place.So, grievances all around.The irony is that it was the ineptness of the Unionist parties that effectively handed power over to the SNP ndash they had lost sight of the direction of travel of politics in Scotland. If Mr Howell wishes theof a Unionist-supporting regime at Holyrood he would be better to write pointing out the error of their ways, rather than treat us to the unyielding rhetoric against the SNP, and consequently, against the huge number of voters who have demonstrated that preference.Douglas R Mayer, Thomson Crescent,Currie, Midlothian.NOTING that Ukraine has elected a comedian as their new president , perhaps we should consider nominating a few of our top comics to parliament.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The group offered ldquofull and sincere apologies to her family and friends.

Now, the New IRA accept responsibility for her murder, while asking their members to be more careful when trying to murder people in future.ldquoTo be clear, killing a police officer is every bit as wrong as killing a journalist. Both are there doing their job. Both of them have families who care about them. Neither deserve to be shot in cold blood.Police in Northern Ireland say the investigation into the killing is continuing at a ldquorapid pace.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said more than  people had contacted officers with information, adding: ldquoThis was an attack on the community. Lyra, tragically, was a random victim and I need the public to continue to support us.ldquoMany witnesses have contacted us to give us information that has been provided to them.ldquoMore than  people have contacted us via our MIPPwith messages, including mobile phone footage.Mr Murphy appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.copy -.

Last week, in the Barmulloch Residents Centre at a meeting of community activists in the north of Glasgow, I heard once more first-hand about the impact that austerity is having on the lives of thousands of people.The campaigners and representatives of community and faith groups spoke in clear and moving terms about the consequences of cuts to our social and economic fabric: an increase in isolation, rising mental health issues especially amongst young people, the scourge of low pay and the impact of universal credit.Powerful testimony of the personal as well as the community-wide fall-out of austerity. But they also described the impact of cuts in their own funding: one organisation facing a  per cent overnight reduction, another,  per cent. These organisations are the glue that help hold communities together. At the close of the meeting, I spoke to the press, and I was asked by a journalist from this newspaper, about my views on the sht that is taking place within the SNP over their policy on currency.It is highly topical: at its conference next weekend, the SNP is likely to back a far riskier currency policy than even the one that caused them so much dficulty during the  independence referendum. They will now decide on whether to move towards a separate Scottish currency with “a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of the first term of an independent parliament”.But the question is also directly and immediately relevant to those organisations and communities at the sharp end of austerity in communities like Barmulloch. Not least because austerity isn’t evenly spread across society. We are not all in it together.The possibility of Scotland having a new currency creates further uncertainty. Communities and organisations in Barmulloch – like their counterparts across Scotland – seek stability and sufficient funding to meet their needs.: Case for separate Scots currency after independence is weak, say expertsMoving to a new currency increases instability with respect to wages, prices and funding. A prosperous, fairer Scotland will not be achieved on the back of a new currency. Then layer on to this the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission that proposes a five-to-ten year period of deficit reduction to get Scotland’s deficit below three per cent. That would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for public spending and has been widely criticised, including by the left of the SNP’s own independence movement.These two economic policies would lead to even greater austerity than we have witnessed over the last decade. This is not only my assessment but that of former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan.And this represents the sum total of the economic policy being developed in the SNP as their blueprint for independence. It is not merely the opposite of progressive economics, it is very bad economics.Two things strike me about this, in the context of that Glasgow community event and the profound questions it posed.One, the brutal reality of the SNP’s new currency, alongside their cuts programme, is thin gruel for the public. None of this  is a solution to the very real problems that I am hearing at community events around Scotland. More to the point, in every regard, they would make them considerably worse. And two, the preoccupation with nationalist projects of one sort or another has the effect of erting away from the real, harsh and pressing problems facing people. Because while our political system is preoccupied with all of this, it is not considering the radical steps that should be taken to rebalance our society and eradicate its worst social ills. That must change.The truth is that in the midst of the great challenges of the st century, our politics is bound up in competing nationalisms that bury everything beneath endless process. They not only ert us from the greater questions we ought to confront – they offer no coherent solution to them. Nationalism is an insufficient prescription for the great social, economic and environmental challenges we face.: Kenny MacAskill: Why SNP shouldn’t get in fankle over Scottish currencyAfter all we live in extraordinary times. The most powerful nation in the world is led by its worst President in living memory. Whilst the USA turns on itself, the Chinese economy continues to power China’s growth as a global force, an historic sht in the balance of the global financial and economic system. Asthis was not a big enough moment, the clock is ticking on the existential threat of climate change. Climate school strikes and the Extinction Rebellion protests are clear enough indicators of how far-removed mainstream political elites are from resolving the threat to our planet.This week MSPs willfrom the Easter recess at a time when people are deeply pessimistic and gravely concerned about the chaos of leaving one major economic market. It does not draw most people towards a second independence referendum but rather for the vast majority strikes a salutary note of caution.And we are now gearing up for elections to the European Parliament. That itself is already a defeat for Theresa May. We must not allow this election to become a  choice between competing nationalisms: British and Scottish. In fact one of the challenges is to defeat the right-wing populism of Farage and his former party Ukip, and help build a movement for radical reform and real change where the language of priorities is decent jobs and fair pay, an end to poverty and overcoming inequality, good homes and affordable rents, high-quality public services and genuine equality. The Party of European Socialists is calling for an end to the economics of neo-liberalism and for a new social contract along these lines, as part of the construction of a fairer Europe. In or out of membership of the European Union, that is something worth fighting for.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jack mcconnell house of lords should not be abolished just to save the union","story":"A former First Minister of Scotland has said abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected Senate should not be done just to #help save the union# or to replace the EU.Labour peer, Lord Jack McConnell, who was First Minister for six years, said the recent support of Scots Tory MSP Murdo Fraser and Labour’s Baroness Pauline Bryan, to the idea of replacing the unelected Lords with an elected Senate of members from across the UK, was to be welcomed.But he stressed that Lords reform should be carried out for democratic reasons and to “ensure the country is governed properly”.: Nicola Sturgeon set to unveil party’s Scottish independence plansSpeaking ahead of an Edinburgh event tomorrow, in which he will reflect on  years of devolution, Lord McConnell said: “I fully support the idea of replacing the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and Regions and have done for many years. In fact I first discussed it with Robin Cook when he was leading on Lords reform for the Labour government nearly  years ago.“He saw it as a big challenge but one which would reflect the fact that devolution had happened but that there still remained issues about representation in the English regions.“So I support the idea enthusiastically but I am concerned about the way it is developing. I do not think that a Senate should be established to help save the union, or to replace the EU as an over-arching body. Those would be the wrong reasons for such a big constitutional change. It should be about how do we revitalise democracy, how do we improve our democratic system and people’s engagement and how do we ensure the country is governed properly.”Tory MSP Murdo Fraser published a paper on Monday for the Bright Blue Scotland thinktank in which he recommended a post-Brexit “quasi-federal” constitutional settlement including abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with a Senate of elected members from across the UK.The paper argued that the current political arrangements are inadequate and support for independence in dferent parts of the UK will increase unless there is constitutional reform.Mr Fraser said: “With nationalists in dferent parts of the United Kingdom seeking to use Brexit uncertainty for their own political ends, it is important that unionists have a coherent response. Introducing a UK-wide Senate delivers the long-awaited and overdue reform of the House of Lords, giving a better balance to the UK constitution and protecting the interests of the nations and regions furthest from London.”Baroness Pauline Bryan, thepeer appointed by Jeremy Corbyn to develop constitutional policy, had previously published a paper which called for a ‘total reform’ of the House of Lords and a ‘new relationship’ between Scotland and Westminster. The document takes the party much closer to backing full federalism and the abolition of the Lords, with a new second chamber likely to take its place. Baroness Bryan said: “The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.”Lord McConnell said: “I am quite excited about the level of support this idea is generating, those of us who have supported it for years have been in the wilderness. But it should be done because it restores democracy, not used as just a political tool or as a sop to deal with nationalism. “Nor do I think it should be a mix of appointed and elected people - the appointment system of the Lords needs to end entirely, not just partially.“For me, the benefit of a Senate of Nations and Regions is that it would breathe new political le into the country outside of London where there is still too much focus, and allow many new voices to be heard in a revising, second chamber.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon set to unveil party s scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon is being urged to #take independence off the table# as she prepares to make a statement in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday on her plans for a second referendum.The SNP leader will make a “detailed and substantive” address to MSPs on Wednesday afternoon on Scotland’s future in light of the Brexit turmoil and set out her thinking on the staging of a second independence referendum, which she has pledged to hold.It comes ahead of the SNP conference this weekend when the party will step up its campaign for a second vote on leaving the UK, by adopting a new flagship economic policy that would see an independent Scotland adopt a stand-alone currency after a Yes vote.But pro-union parties have called for an end to the constitutional wrangling.Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to be judged on education, yet here we see her passing up the opportunity to talk about that very subject.“Instead, she’s ing to her real priority, her plan for a isive second referendum on independence.“The only reason this statement is happening at all is because Nicola Sturgeon put a second independence referendum back on the table following the EU vote. “And she has obsessed about it ever since.”Ms Sturgeon’s address will last half an hour and the SNP leader will then take a further hour of questions from MSPs.“The First Minister will give a detailed and substantive statement, setting out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster,” a spokesman for the SNP leader said. “The First Minister will take time to set out her thoughts on that front and, in doing so, she will seek to strike an inclusive tone.”He added: “It will cover the situation in respect of Brexit, where things have reached in recent weeks and months. Looking forward it will obviously touch on Scotland’s future, it will touch obviously on her thoughts on independence and how that relates to where the country currently finds itself.”Asked what Theresa May’s response would beNicola Sturgeon used the speech to call for a Section  order to pave the way for a second independence referendum, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: “You know the Prime Minister’s position on that and it has not changed.” Polling still suggests most Scots oppose independence and a second referendum.Labour leader Richard Leonard said: “Nicola Sturgeon can produce no evidence that the people of Scotland want another independence referendum.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: “The First Minister should take independence off the table, show the country she’s learnt lessons from the chaos of the last two-and-a-half years and put businesses’ minds at ease.”But Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie called on Ms Sturgeon to use the mandate she has for a second referendum when MSPs at Holyrood voted for it in .Mr Harvie said: “The Scottish Greens stand ready to campaign hard for an independent Scotland in the EU.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.: Indyref: Sturgeon to update MSPs on referendum plans: Indyref: Tory bid to block Sturgeon’s referendum statement fails©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence first minister held to sturgeon test of indyref2 support","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister has been urged to stand by her own #Sturgeon Test# on holding a second independence referendum as she prepares to address MSPs on her plans for a second vote on leaving the UK.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave. She insists this represented a “material change” in circumstances which opened the door for another vote.The pro-independence majority at the Scottish Parliament, combining SNP and Green MSPs, has also voted in favour of a second referendum being held.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tam dean burn on lost at sea this is an epic story that gets right inside a community","story":"The last time Tam Dean Burn appeared in a Perth Theatre production, it was the winter of -. Margaret Thatcher had recently been elected prime minister, the post-punk rebellion against all things Establishment was in full swing and although the young Tam knew that he was lucky in conventional terms to have won a vital first theatre job as an acting ASM with Joan Knight#s legendary Perth company, he frankly felt that there were other places he would rather be.Back in Edinburgh and Glasgow, he had been closely involved with the radical playwright George Byatt, whose Theatre PKF had already scored a left-field success with his brilliant, fantastical theatrical poem The Clyde Is Red. Another Byatt play-with-music, Why Does The Pope Not Come To Glasgow, had caused a stir at the  Edinburgh Fringe. Dean Burn also played in a band called The Dirty Reds, and – as a born and bred Edinburgh lad – was closely involved in the burgeoning Edinburgh indie music scene around the Fast Product record label, run by Bob Last.“Punk had had this enormous impact on us,” says Dean Burn, talking of an Edinburgh generation that also included luminaries like Irvine Welsh, and musician Davy Henderson of the Fire Engines. “I just felt that there was so much going on in Edinburgh and Glasgow at the time, in both music and theatre and then I had to go away and be in Perth for seven months. I did want the possibility of a career as an actor, though and when they told me I would lose my new Equity cardI left, I decided to stick it out.”The whole episode, in other words, was typical of the rich creative tension that has shaped Dean Burn’s le as an actor, theatre-maker, musician and radical activist. To the wider public, he is probably best known as a familiar face in films and television series that range from River City to the recent BBC series The Victim, starring Kelly Macdonald. Last month a -year-old-man appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court charged with attempted murder following reports that Dean Burn had been stabbed just after leaving the Scottish Poetry Library where he spoke at a tribute event. Throughout his acting le, Dean Burn has continued to work in theatre as well as on screen, to play in bands including his current ensemble The Bum-Clocks, and to explore the wilder reaches of radical theatre, criss-crossing art-forms, and often wearing his socialist and anti-Establishment politics on his sleeve. And now, all of those strands are coming together for Dean Burn, in the project that has brought him back to Perth.Morna Young’s new play Lost At Sea is an intense piece of personal history, shaped by Young’s own experience as the daughter of a fishing family in the tiny north-east coast village of Burghead. When she was five years old in , her fisherman father Donnie Young was lost in the North Sea and after an early career as a journalist in London, Morna Young has spent the last eight years gradually putting together the material she needs – the stories, the memories, the recorded interviews around the community where she grew up – to tell both the story of his death and the wider history of the industry in which he worked, and which has always exacted such a heavy price from Britain’s coastal communities. The result, says Dean Burn, is a vital piece of recent working-class history, told in the voices of the people who lived it, through songs, choruses, and powerful visual images, as well as dialogue and the sheer quality of the team that has been attracted to it – which includes former Traverse and West Yorkshire Playhouse director Ian Brown, composer Pippa Murphy, and a superb nine-strong cast led by Dean Burn with Gerry Mulgrew of Communicado – is perhaps a measure both of the intense quality of Young’s play, and of the current lack of powerful working-class drama in British theatre.“For me, this is a great epic story that uses a chorus of voices to get right inside a community, in a way that only someone who belongs to that community could do,” says Dean Burn. “Morna lost her dad to the sea, and also other family members, in this profession that’s so ancient it almost transcends time, and yet is now struggling to survive. “Like everything  in our society, the fishing industry has been distorted and corrupted by capitalism, in particular by the way the British government chose to make EU quotas and licences tradeable commodities. Yet when people are lost, fishing communities often find it too painful to go back and ask why and that’s why Morna’s work is so important: because she has been able to persuade a community shaped by these experiences to talk about it, and to be part of making this play.”He adds: “Back in  I took part in the first-ever reading of Lost At Sea in Lossiemouth, very near Burghead and it was an extraordinary experience. I don’t think I’ve ever been part of a performance that meant so much to an audience. These are communities that often don’t look outward, don’t expect the wider world to understand their lives that’s one reason why the Doric language is still so strong with them. But Morna speaks and writes that language, in a wonderfully theatrical way and now, I’m really thrilled to be part of this great team, bringing the le of that community, and what it tells us about our society, to audiences all over Scotland – and maybe beyond.” Lost at Sea is at Perth Theatre from  April until  May©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe .

If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory.

Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind.

The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk. She became very agitated when I pointed out to her oral and general health was no better nor worse than many of my overseas immigrant patients. Needless to say, I was cascaded with a barrage of insults and threats. Thankfully she and her like-minded bigots blocked me on Facebook, thank God for small mercies!I made a conscious decision to stop going to muslim countries  years ago because I saw what was about to happen. Sitting watching a ramadan service on state televisionI was not already aware of what was coming the imam made it quite clear what should happen to the likes of us. I really do suggest you go find out for yourself Peter. To anyone  I say stay away and take the word of those who know better.Very sadly many, many religions have a few thugs and bigots in their ranks posing as priests. Islam and Christianity both have plenty of corrupted teachers and perverted followers. That has absolutely nothing to do with Brexit, but all to do with sectarianism and racism. As I said Islamophobia is alive and well on Shetland, fortunately, such views held by an unpleasant and ignorant minority."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38043970.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PSNI_Road_Policing.jpg","title":"driver caught doing 122mph on treacherous northern","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The group offered “full and sincere apologies” to her family and friends.A friend to all, a gentle innocent soul who wouldn’t wish ill on anyoneLyra McKees family describe the murdered journalistThe admission came the day before Ms McKee’s funeral at Belfast Cathedral on Wednesday.A tribute from her mother Joan, brothers Gary and David, and sisters Joan Hunter, Nichola Corner and Mary Crossan said: “On Thursday th April our beautul Lyra was taken from us.“A daughter, a sister, an aunt, a great-aunt, a partner, a niece, a cousin, and above all, a best friend and confidante to so many of us.“A friend to all, a gentle innocent soul who wouldn’t wish ill on anyone. Such a warm and innocent heart, she was the greatest listener, someone who had time for everyone.”The McKee family added: “She was a smart, strong-minded woman who believed passionately in inclusivity, justice and truth.“Lyra spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background, those of all political views and those with none. This openness, and her desire to bring people together, made her totally apolitical.”“We would ask that Lyra’s le and her personal philosophy are used as an example to us all as we face this tragedy together. Lyra’s answer would have been simple, the only way to overcome hatred and intolerance is with love, understanding and kindness,” they said.The family also made the statement on behalf of their spouses and Ms McKee’s nieces and nephews.They thanked their local community for their “outpouring of support and love,” adding: “We ask everyone who knew Lyra to continue her message of positivity and hope, by respecting her memory with dignity and respect.”Sara Canning, Ms McKee’s partner, said previously: “Our hopes and dreams and all of her amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act.”A -year-old woman arrested on Tuesday morning by detectives investigating the murder has now been released unconditionally.Detectives from PSNI Major Investigation Team are continuing to appeal for help from the local community in Creggan or anyone with information.Two men aged  and  were initially arrested in connection with the killing but were later released without charge.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Floral tributes have been left at the spot where journalist Lyra McKee was murdered The New IRA is an amalgam of armed groups opposed to the peace process and it recently claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to London and Glasgow in March.Police believe the violence was orchestrated in response to an earlier search by officers aimed at averting imminent trouble associated with this week’s anniversary of the Easter Rising.The statement said: “On Thursday night, following an incursion on the Creggan by heavily armed British crown forces which provoked rioting, the IRA deployed our volunteers to engage.“We have instructed our volunteers to take the utmost care in future when engaging the enemy, and put in place measures to help ensure this.“In the course of attacking the enemy Lyra McKee was tragically killed while standing beside enemy forces.“The IRA offer our full and sincere apologies to the partner, family and friends of Lyra McKee for her death.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Friends of murdered journalist Lyra McKee defaced the walls of a dissident republican office SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the statement was an absolute disgrace, that showed no remorse for the death of Ms McKee.“Their so-called instruction to their ‘volunteers’ to ‘take the utmost care’ when engaging in violence is utterly sickening and devoid of any humanity,” he said.He added: “The murder of Lyra McKee must not be in vain. Together, political leaders must come together to re-engage in a talks process to fill the vacuum that currently gives groups like this too much oxygen.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: “First, their spokespeople dismissed Lyra McKee’s murder as an “accident”. Now, the New IRA accept responsibility for her murder, while asking their members to be more careful when trying to murder people in future.“To be clear, killing a police officer is every bit as wrong as killing a journalist. Both are there doing their job. Both of them have families who care about them. Neither deserve to be shot in cold blood.”Police in Northern Ireland say the investigation into the killing is continuing at a “rapid pace”.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said more than  people had contacted officers with information, adding: “This was an attack on the community. Lyra, tragically, was a random victim and I need the public to continue to support us.“Many witnesses have contacted us to give us information that has been provided to them.“More than  people have contacted us via our MIPPwith messages, including mobile phone footage.”Mr Murphy appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward."},{"url":null,"title":"lyra mckee vigil in dublin organised by trade union attended by hundreds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated. A special mention to chairman Michael Mulholland for organising the transport to the final.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison,Andrew Mulholland , William Edgar, Stuart Hunter, Matthew Martin, Alex Millar, Jason Campbell, Scott Leetch, Luke Curry, Michael Carney, Steven Crean, David Marshall, Josh Higginson.Man of the match: William Edgar.Ballynahinch Limerick IRISH HOCKEY CHALLENGE CUP FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Archaeological dig uncovers skeletons dating back to 8th century  ","story":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL material found at Downpatrickrsquos Cathedral Hill dates back as far as  years after the birth of Jesus.Work from a Queenrsquos University Belfast team of archaeologists has dated skeletons buried some  years later, indicating a sizeable community living in Downpatrick at the time.The material was recovered during last Augustrsquos four-week excavation and community investigation which attracted , visitors from around the world.Local volunteers played a major role in uncovering the history of the site and there is another opportunity to get involved in another dig.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin is urging local people, particularly students, to get involved in another dig which is to take place this August.ldquoI visited the archaeological dig on Cathedral Hill several times in August last year and was impressed by the community involvement, the volume of tourist visits and of course the incredible finds being made from our rich early Christian and medieval past, just a stonersquos throw from the traditional site of St Patrickrsquos grave, he said.ldquoItrsquos exciting to hear about the new discoveries that are being made and the Early Christian dates of some of the finds, and I am delighted to announce that a second season of excavation is to be funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body for this August, as part of its PEACE IV Programme, when young people between  and  will be invited to take part in the dig for at least four days. Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The group offered ldquofull and sincere apologies to her family and friends. The admission came the day before Ms McKeersquos funeral at Belfast Cathedral on Wednesday.A tribute from her mother Joan, brothers Gary and David, and sisters Joan Hunter, Nichola Corner and Mary Crossan said:ldquoOn Thursday th April our beautul Lyra was taken from us.ldquoA daughter, a sister, an aunt, a great-aunt, a partner, a niece, a cousin, and above all, a best friend and confidante to so many of us.ldquoA friend to all, a gentle innocent soul who wouldnrsquot wish ill on anyone. Such a warm and innocent heart, she was the greatest listener, someone who had time for everyone.The McKee family added: ldquoShe was a smart, strong-minded woman who believed passionately in inclusivity, justice and truth.ldquoLyra spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background, those of all political views and those with none. This openness, and her desire to bring people together, made her totally apolitical.ldquoWe would ask that Lyrarsquos le and her personal philosophy are used as an example to us all as we face this tragedy together. Lyrarsquos answer would have been simple, the only way to overcome hatred and intolerance is with love, understanding and kindness, they said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A message of condolence for -year-old journalist Lyra McKee which has been graffitied on to the Free Derry Corner  --The family also made the statement on behalf of their spouses and Ms McKeersquos nieces and nephews.They thanked their local community for their ldquooutpouring of support and love, adding: ldquoWe ask everyone who knew Lyra to continue her message of positivity and hope, by respecting her memory with dignity and respect.Sara Canning, Ms McKeersquos partner, said previously: ldquoOur hopes and dreams and all of her amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act.A -year-old woman arrested on Tuesday morning by detectives investigating the murder has now been released unconditionally.Detectives from PSNI Major Investigation Team are continuing to appeal for help from the local community in Creggan or anyone with information.Two men aged  and  were initially arrested in connection with the killing but were later released without charge. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Floral tributes have been left at the spot where journalist Lyra McKee was murdered  --The New IRA is an amalgam of armed groups opposed to the peace process and it recently claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to London and Glasgow in March.Police believe the violence was orchestrated in response to an earlier search by officers aimed at averting imminent trouble associated with this weekrsquos anniversary of the Easter Rising.The statement said: ldquoOn Thursday night, following an incursion on the Creggan by heavily armed British crown forces which provoked rioting, the IRA deployed our volunteers to engage.ldquoWe have instructed our volunteers to take the utmost care in future when engaging the enemy, and put in place measures to help ensure this.ldquoIn the course of attacking the enemy Lyra McKee was tragically killed while standing beside enemy forces.ldquoThe IRA offer our full and sincere apologies to the partner, family and friends of Lyra McKee for her death. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Friends of murdered journalist Lyra McKee defaced the walls of a dissident republican office  --SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the statement was an absolute disgrace, that showed no remorse for the death of Ms McKee.ldquoTheir so-called instruction to their lsquovolunteersrsquo to lsquotake the utmost carersquo when engaging in violence is utterly sickening and devoid of any humanity, he said.He added: ldquoThe murder of Lyra McKee must not be in vain. Together, political leaders must come together to re-engage in a talks process to fill the vacuum that currently gives groups like this too much oxygen.Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: ldquoFirst, their spokespeople dismissed Lyra McKeersquos murder as an ldquoaccident. Now, the New IRA accept responsibility for her murder, while asking their members to be more careful when trying to murder people in future.ldquoTo be clear, killing a police officer is every bit as wrong as killing a journalist. Both are there doing their job. Both of them have families who care about them. Neither deserve to be shot in cold blood.Police in Northern Ireland say the investigation into the killing is continuing at a ldquorapid pace.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said more than  people had contacted officers with information, adding: ldquoThis was an attack on the community. Lyra, tragically, was a random victim and I need the public to continue to support us.ldquoMany witnesses have contacted us to give us information that has been provided to them.ldquoMore than  people have contacted us via our MIPPwith messages, including mobile phone footage.Mr Murphy appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lyra McKee us family grieving loss of  ugentle innocent soul u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

principal and naval reserve officer simon harper  ","story":"An international rugby star and a former education minister are among those who have paid tribute to Portadown College principal Simon Harper who died suddenly while on holiday in Scotland.Past pupil Rory Best said he was “incredibly saddened” at the news, while Peter Weir MLA described Mr Harper as having played a “crucial role” in the Northern Ireland education system.Having taught at Rathfriland High School and Regent House in Newtownards, Mr Harper took over as principal of Portadown College in .“He played a crucial role in local education and many will join me in mourning his passing,” Mr Weir said.“I think we’d have been on a very similar page. I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.try catch  TrendingPortadown College principal dies suddenlyTribute paid to Portadown College

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
