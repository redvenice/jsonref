It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education.

They paid $10million for the 5.3-acre property in 1998When one of the women asked her what her talent agent husband Patrick Whitesell, 53, would say, Sanchez supposedly replied: \u0027Let\u0027s find out.\u0027  The friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com: \u0027She called him and asked: Is it okay if I buy all these shoes?\u0027 He told her yes.\u0027 Sanchez then confided: \u0027I have him wrapped – I can have anything I want.\u0027 According to the friend Sanchez is  \u0027very sweet but she was always a climber.\u0027Sanchez\u0027s impressive shoe and clothes collection was even documented in an interview with Us Weekly in 2011, during which she gave a tour of her massive closet.   While working as a reporter for news magazine Extra in 2010, she offered another glimpse into her designer wardrobe during a \u0027Ultimate Denim Guide\u0027 segment.   Sanchez is a third-generation Mexican-American who was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she had a modest upbringing. In 2017 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Sanchez revealed she \u0027came from nothing\u0027 and \u0027used to sleep in the back of my grandmother\u0027s car when she would go clean houses.\u0027 Her career in news and entertainment kicked off when she moved to California for college and later landed gigs as a television host in Los Angeles appearing on shows such as Extra, Showbiz Tonight, Fox 11 and Good Day LA.           While working as a reporter for news magazine Extra in 2010, she offered glimpse into her designer wardrobe during a \u0027Ultimate Denim Guide\u0027 segment          Sanchez\u0027s impressive shoe collection can be seen in the background           She also shot a segment behind the scenes of her bikini shoot where she was seen picking out swimsuits           Pictured is Lauren Sanchez\u0027s  house in Beverly Hills.

She tried to be a sexy anchor but she lacked taste,\u0027 the friend dished. \u0027Her bosses at Fox told her to tone it down.\u0027       Aside from her on-screen jobs, Sanchez has a passion for flying and launched her own film aerial production, Black Ops Aviation, in 2016. Friends believe things between Bezos and Sanchez heated up after he hired her to do aerial shots for Amazon.  Over the last several years, both couples have been photographed at glitzy events including the Vanity Fair Oscars party.  Despite her affair, the friend told DailyMail.com that Sanchez and Whitesell remain friends and were even spotted chatting at Amazon\u0027s Golden Globes after party on Sunday night. News of Bezos\u0027s and Sanchez\u0027s relationship would break just days later, along with reports of an eight-month affair involving steamy texts, nude photo exchanges, private jet rendezvous, intimate dinners and sleepovers at each other\u0027s marital homes.A friend described Sanchez as \u0027very sweet but she was always a climber.\u0027 She allegedly bragged about her relationship with Bezos, the world\u0027s richest man, which led to the revelation of their affair           Sanchez and Whitesell are seen with actor Casey Affleck at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscar Party. Affleck won for Manchester By The Sea - which was made by AmazonBut those stories came to light after Sanchez allegedly bragged to friends about her secret lover and sent them the explicit text messages and selfies he had sent her.According to Page Six, Sanchez sent a friend a photograph of Bezos\u0027s genitalia which he had sent her along with other messages which included him telling her he loved her and that he wanted to \u0027breathe her in\u0027. The friend slipped the messages to The National Enquirer and that it was triggered its exhaustive, four month investigation into the pair\u0027s romance, according to the source.  One source who claimed to have seen the photograph of Bezos\u0027 genitalia that he sent Sanchez told Page Six: \u0027He\u0027s big.\u0027           Sanchez, a third-generation Mexican American, was born and raised in Albuquerque, New MexicoThey have both denied cheating on their spouses since details of their romance emerged on Wednesday evening. Sanchez and Hollywood mega agent Whitesell tied the knot in 2005 at a star-studded wedding in Santa Barbara that was packed with many of Whitesell\u0027s biggest clients. \u0027Matt and Ben don\u0027t get to see each other often, so we sat them together,\u0027 Sanchez told People at the time, referring to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Also on the guest list was Jennifer Garner, Jessica Alba, and Hugh Jackman. The pair did a \u0027sexy rumba\u0027 for their first dance, choreographed by So You Think You Can Dance\u0027s Mary Murphy, and shared a passionate kiss at the altar. \u0027The kiss was long. You could tell they\u0027re in love,\u0027 wedding planner Marianne Weiman-Nelson recalled. It seemed like a dream come true for Sanchez, who had previously been engaged to NYPD Blue actor Henry Simmons and shares son Nico, now 17, with ex-boyfriend Tony Gonzalez, a former tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. After giving birth to Evan, now 12, and Ella, 10, Sanchez returned to Extra as a weekend anchor and special correspondent and began co-hosting Good Day La from 2011 to 2017.She also made a number of appearances on the big screen, portraying a news anchor for movies including White House Down, Ted 2, and We Bought A Zoo.    Sanchez\u0027s sisters Elena Sanchez (left) and LeAnn Sanchez (right) were seen days after news of the affair broke           Sanchez is seen with Pauly D and her co-host Steve Edwards on Good Day LA in April 2012           Aside from her on-screen jobs, Sanchez has a passion for flying and launched her own film aerial production, Black Ops Aviation, in 2016 But even as her hosting career flourished, Sanchez was finding out she was happiest behind the camera - and above the ground. Sanchez served as a consultant for Christopher Nolan\u0027s Dunkirk, and most recently worked as an aerial producer for the upcoming Miss Bala starring Gina Rodriguez. Sanchez\u0027s company was hired to shoot an aerial video for Bezos\u0027s side venture Blue Origin. It was previously reported that the pair have been dating since June, months before Sanchez separated from Whitesell in the fall and nine months before Bezos announced he was splitting with Mackenzie.According to the Enquirer, the pair met several times for illicit trysts as often as six times in two weeks.He reportedly took her on vacations on his $65million private jet and sent her erotic selfies that were \u0027too explicit\u0027 even for the magazine to print.A source close to Bezos told DailyMail.com that the Amazon founder only began seeing Sanchez after separating from his wife - however the National Enquirer claims the affair went on behind their spouses\u0027 backs.

Property values in the capital have continued to skyrocket over the last decade.His application to the council, necessary because the flat is situated in a conservation area, also asks for permission to install dormer windows and a rooflight. His architects wrote to the council acknowledging that the council had previously said it was \u0027supportive in principle\u0027 of the roof terrace, but asked for it to be \u0027more discrete\u0027. Since that would mean they wanted his terrace to be more separate from surrounding architectural elements, they may have meant \u0027more discreet\u0027.   The GBBO cast at Christmas: Paul Hollywood, Sandi Toksvig, Prue Leith and Noel Fielding          Julian Barret as Howard Moon (left) and Noel Fielding as Vince Noir (right) in a Mighty Boosh stage show in 2006Planners are expected to make a decision next month.Noel Fielding is best known for co-presenting Channel 4\u0027s the Great British Bake Off alongside Sandi Toksvig and Paul Hollywood, after the show\u0027s move from the BBC. From 2003 to 2007, with Julian Barratt, he co-wrote and starred in The Mighty Boosh, a surrealist comedy on BBC Three which went on to have a successful stage run.Liana Bird, his partner of nine years, is a Radio X presenter and charity founder who four years ago helped launch Help Refugees, a voluntary organisation aimed at improving the lives of refugees across Europe and the Middle East."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/14/09/00017EEA00000258-6588033-On_her_wedding_day_in_1999_she_wore_a_cowboy_hat_carried_a_half_-a-3_1547457400411.jpg","title":"Are ready wake ZOE BALL Radio 2","story":"    \u0027Zoe Ball, 48, was one of the original inspirations for new term \u0027ladette\u0027 in the Nineties\u0027.

Plan B – what is it and why do we need one? Theresa May has struck a deal with the EU - but MPs are expected to vote it down by a massive majority tomorrow, meaning she will have to come up with a Plan B.And last week week MPs passed an amendment put forward by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve which gives the PM just three working days to come up with her new plan.It means she will be hauled back to the Commons on Monday to spell out what she will do next.The PM has so far refused to say what her Plan B will be, but she will be under huge pressure to rule out a no deal Brexit and say what direction  she plans to take the talks in next.Remainers will want her to go for a Norway-style deal, which will keep the UK in the single market and therefore free movement, or a second referendum.While Brexiteers will push for the PM to go for a Canada-style free deal which will take Britain fully out of the EU\u0027s customs union and single market.          It is believed that Tory former ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve (pictured) are also involved in the plot have launched a plot to try to take over Brexit talks if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down tomorrow and she cannot come up with a plan in three days2. The Remainer plot - who is behind it and how would it work?A  group of Tory Remainers have launched a plot to try to take over Brexit talks if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down tomorrow and she cannot come up with a plan in three days.Tory MP Nick Boles said that if this happens the Liaison Committee - a committee of 32 senior MPs which is dominated by Remainers - should take over the talks.It is believed that Tory former ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve are also involved in the plot.This plan to sideline the Government would flout the rules of Parliament, but Commons Speaker John Bercow - who would have the final say on if this is possible or not - has made it clear he is happy to re-write the rules when it comes to Brexit.No10 believe that if the plan succeeds then the MPs on the committee will push for a softer Brexit, for example to get a Norway-style deal which would keep the UK in the single market and therefore keeping free movement of people.3. No deal - what would it mean for Britain and who opposes it?Britain has been locked in talks with the EU to thrash out a Brexit deal, but if MPs vote it down tomorrow and a new plan cannot be quickly agreed then the UK will crash out with no deal.But many MPs have warned they will do whatever it takes to block a no deal - fearing this will send the UK\u0027s economy into meltdown. And a string of Cabinet ministers, including Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke are expected to quit the Cabinet in fury if the PM then backs a no deal Brexit.Economic experts have issued dire warnings about the fall-out of a no deal with the CBI saying it could slash 8 per cent off the size of the UK\u0027s economy and plunging the country into a massive recession.But there is a group of die-hard Brexiteers in the Tory Party, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, who say there is nothing to fear about a no deal Brexit.This group sees going for a no deal Brexit as a step towards their goal of achieving a Canada plus style trade deal with the EU.    Jeremy Corbyn (pictured in the Commons today) is hoping to seize on the chaos if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down tomorrow to table a no cinfidence motion and try to topple Mrs May from No104. No Confidence Vote - what is it and who would back it? If the PM\u0027s deal is voted down tomorrow then Jeremy Corbyn is expected to seize on the disarray to table a motion of no confidence in the government.If the PM lost the vote, then another MP has 14 working days to hold and win a vote of confidence of MPs - if they manage this then they become PM. If no party leader can do this within the two weeks then another general election is called. But it is unlikely that the Labour leader will be able to win the backing of a single MP from the ranks of the Tories or the DUP - meaning his bid to topple Mrs May is likely to fail. 5. General Election - how could one be called and who wants it?Labour have been demanding an election, while many commentators believe that the Tories may end up having to call another election to break the political deadlock in Parliament.    Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, Mrs May would need the Commons to agree to hold another election - and many MPs will be dead-set against the plan which they fear would cost them their seats and could hand Mr Corbyn the keys to No10. But if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down and MPs cannot agree an alternative before the UK leaves on March 29 then an election may end up being called to bring in new MPs who may be able back a deal.    Many MPs are pushing for a second referendum to be held, less than three years after voters backed Brexit (file pic of voting booth)6. Second referendum – why might we need one and what would the question be? Many MPs are pushing for a second referendum to be held, less than three years after voters backed Brexit.Remainers argue that with MPs unable to agree a deal among themselves then the only way forward is to send the question back to the public.Many Labour MPs, the Lib Dems and a powerful group of Tory MPs all back a second referendum.But Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out holding one while she is PM, and even backers of the plan are at loggerheads over what should be on the ballot paper.Some Remainers believe voters should be offered a choice between the PM\u0027s plan and remaining in the EU on current terms, but some others believe a no deal Brexit on world trade organisation terms should be offered.7. Who is Gareth Johnson, the latest Tory to quit the government?Tory MP Gareth Johnson today quit as a whip whose job it is to comnvince his fellow Conservative MPs to back the PM\u0027s plan - so he vcan opose the deal.He is the latest in a long line of Tory MPs who have resigned as aides and ministers to voice their objections to her blueprint.The MP for Dartford has a strongly Leave-supporting seat, and he was appointed an assistant whip, one of the most junior ranks, in November last year.Sources said he had been \u0027desperate\u0027 to get into government, but pointed out that his voters were overwhelmingly Brexit-backing.  Resigning today, he said he was  putting his \u0027loyalty to the country above loyalty to the government\u0027.     From deal-killing amendments courtesy of the arch-Remainers to Corbyn\u0027s Customs Union gambit: How Tuesday\u0027s drama will unfoldBy Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail12.30pm: Assuming there are no delays, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC will stand up to open the final day of debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Beforehand Speaker John Bercow will select the amendments to the motion proposed by different groups of MPs. There are likely to be at least half a dozen.During the day MPs who have not spoken during the previous days of debate will stand to make their speeches.6.45pm: Mrs May will sum up the debate and make a final appeal to MPs to back the deal.7pm: Voting begins. First, MPs will vote on the amendments to the deal. If any pass, the final vote is on the deal with those amendments attached.If enough Remainer Tory MPs back the Hilary Benn amendment (see below), the deal has in effect been voted down in advance.9pm: Vote expected on the deal. After the vote Mrs May will make a statement setting out her response and the next steps the Government will take.          House of Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) will select the amendments to the motion proposed by different groups of MPs. There are likely to be at least half a dozen... and those other crucial votesHilary\u0027s deal-killer The most significant amendment by far, proposed by Labour’s arch-Remainer Hilary Benn, chairman of the Brexit select committee. It rejects Mrs May’s deal and ‘no deal’, and urges the Government to bring forward a motion on next steps ‘without delay’. It is backed by Tory supporters of a second referendum, including Dr Sarah Wollaston and Dominic Grieve, and is all but guaranteed to be called by the Speaker. If passed it would kill off Mrs May’s deal – but the Labour frontbench could refuse to support it.Time limit for the backstopTabled by a loyal Tory backbencher, Northern Ireland select committee chairman Andrew Murrison, this would impose a ‘sunset clause’ requiring the Northern Ireland backstop to expire on December 31, 2021. The EU has rejected such a time limit but both Tory arch-Brexiteers and the Northern Irish DUP demand one as a condition of support for the deal. Last night there were rumours ministers were quietly urging MPs to support it. Any explicit endorsement by Mrs May would enrage Brussels but, if passed, it would likely save the PM from a painful defeat.          An amendment proposed by Labour\u0027s Hilary Benn (pictured) rejects Mrs May\u0027s deal and \u0027no deal\u0027, and urges the Government to bring forward a motion on next steps \u0027without delay\u0027Parliamentary veto on the backstop Proposed by Sir Hugo Swire, this would give Parliament an effective veto at the end of the 20-month transition period over whether to enter the Northern Ireland backstop, or extend the transition. Government insiders say the veto would not be binding but it could force the two sides to come to an alternative arrangement. Ministers have said they accept the spirit of the amendment. If selected by the Speaker, it could help build support among Tory MPs but is unlikely to be a game-changer.Corbyn\u0027s customs union gambit  The Labour amendment, put forward by Jeremy Corbyn, says the deal should be rejected because it fails to provide for a permanent customs union and a ‘strong single market’ deal. It also rejects leaving with no deal.Likely to be selected but unlikely to get enough cross-party support to pass.Standing up for the workersFrom John Mann – one of few Labour MPs set to vote for the deal – this amendment provides assurances on workers rights, environmental standards and health and safety. Ministers have said they are sympathetic towards its aims, but it is unlikely to be called by the Speaker. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tory minister shows notes predicting No food No Channel Tunnel no deal Brexit","story":"    Treasury minister Mel Stride was pictured leaving Downing Street today clutching a sheet of paper bearing the words \u0027No food.

If, as seems likely, her Withdrawal Agreement is rejected tonight, and perhaps defeated again at the second time of asking in the near future, there will be havoc.As Brexiteers sought to take Britain out of the European Union without a deal, Remainer Tories would ally with Labour MPs to stop that happening. It seems increasingly possible that opponents of Brexit may get their way and prevent us leaving the EU all together.If that is allowed to happen, millions of Tory supporters who voted Brexit will feel such a profound sense of betrayal that they may simple not vote Conservative again. The party will become unelectable. Such would be the lingering schisms that the Tories could end up virtually extinct as a political force.However, whichever way Parliament votes, don\u0027t think for a single second the deep Conservative isions will go away.Remember that tonight\u0027s vote is simply on the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union. Huge rows in the future await over the exact nature of our future trading relations with Europe. Crucially, the majority of Tory members in the country are bitterly opposed to Mrs May\u0027s deal. And it is they who decide the next Tory leader. Even if a badly damaged Mrs May wins through tonight, they may not forgive her for long.They will want someone they see as a genuine Brexiteer to take Britain forward into the next stage of negotiations.And remember, too, that many former Ukippers have joined the Tories with the intention of turning the Conservatives into the anti-Europe party.Only twice in its history has the Conservative Party faced isions as profound as today\u0027s. Both times it was over trade and tariffs – the same issues which lie at the heart of the European Union question.  Conservative MPs John Redwood (left) and Jacob Rees-Mogg (right) are both expected to vote against Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal in the Commons ision on Tuesday The first was the Corn Laws crisis of the 1840s, when a young Benjamin Disraeli led opposition on behalf of farmers against Prime Minister Robert Peel\u0027s plan to end protectionism. The result was a decade of Tory opposition. The second came before the First World War when the party split wide open over proposals for tariffs on trade from outside the British empire. The party was out of power for two decades that time.Now, there is a real danger that could happen all over again.In my judgment, the crisis over our departure from the European Union is even worse that the Corn Laws crisis, or the tariff controversy at the start of the 20th century.The Conservative Party is in deep, deep trouble whichever way MPs vote. The Tories own Brexit. The party had been fighting a European civil war for three decades before David Cameron called his EU referendum. Then Mrs May became Prime Minister promising to deliver Brexit.She made mistakes, and she\u0027s broken promises – she assured MPs at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers as recently as December 12 that she would deliver legally binding changes to the Northern Irish backstop.That hasn\u0027t happened – and this failure to deliver is the reason she\u0027s in bad trouble tonight.The Tories promised to deliver Brexit. If they turn their back on Mrs May\u0027s deal tonight, many voters will never forgive them. "},{"url":null,"title":"World told 12 Thai cave boys swim freedom lie soothe parents","story":"    The discovery of the 12 Thai boys and their coach alive was sees as a miracle - however getting them out was a huge and very difficult taskOnce they had been located in their dark, subterranean cave, the spirits of the entombed boys of the Wild Boars football team and their coach soared.They now had food and medical care, but most of all they had the company of Dr Pak and three SEALs from Thai Special Forces.

One expert put it starkly to those running the rescue: ‘If we e now, some might die but if we don’t e, everybody will die and we’re just going to collect 13 bodies.’To calm nerves, the parents were told the boys were being taught how to e and the media reported that each of them would be tethered to an air hose and then swim out with one rescue er in front and another behind. This was untrue.Those who’d been inside the flooded tunnels knew there was no way a child who had never ed before could make it through the muddy and treacherous obstacle course. The only hope was to sedate them, put oxygen-fed masks with silicone seals over their faces and let the expert cave ers carry them out.But it was crucial that the masks fitted tightly, otherwise they might drown, and there was an issue with size. Dozens of full-face masks were procured, but most were for adults. Only four were suitable for children, and there were doubts that even these would do for the smallest boys.As for sedating them, that would need specialists, and a call went out to two vastly experienced Australian cave ers, Dr Richard Harris, an anaesthetist known by all as Dr Harry, and his friend and e partner Craig Challen, a retired vet. Dr Harry, who ran a course teaching emergency service workers how to e, would take on the highly delicate task of putting the boys to sleep, while, with his clinical expertise, Challen would be able to check on them as they were ed out.          The heartwarming first picture of the boys from  being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai province, Thailand after they were rescued from the caveAs they flew in, both men were acutely aware of the mammoth risks involved and asked the Thai government for diplomatic immunity. There was a real possibility that some — possibly all — the boys would die, and understandably they did not want to be blamed.The full extent of the dangers involved came crashing in when tragedy struck. Saman Gunan was a 37-year-old former Thai SEAL who had volunteered to help. A formidable character, he ran triathlons and threw himself into extreme endurance sports.As a support er, Gunan was tasked with taking spare oxygen tanks to leave in one of the chambers along the route. He delivered them and set off back to the entrance, but he never made it. His body was found floating in the murky water, with his mouthpiece detached. No one is sure what happened. Was his air tank contaminated? Had he over-exerted himself and a build-up of carbon dioxide put his brain to sleep?Gunan’s death shattered the optimism buzzing around the mountain. If a fit, former SEAL could die, what chances did the Wild Boars have?PREPARATIONS now began in earnest, and to give their plan every chance of success, the rescuers took over a local indoor swimming pool. Thai Navy SEALs and British ers went through a secret dummy run, using three youths of small, medium and tall build — roughly the same sizes as the boys trapped in the cave.They practised putting masks on them, submerging them face down, with a er holding them underneath and passing them through the water. The youngsters were told to stay still, like the soon-to-be-sedated Wild Boars.It was a success, and this brought a lift in mood. But whether it would work in dark flooded tunnels with zero visibility was another matter.          The gripping account explains how the boys were rescued, despite there being a real possibility that some — possibly all — of the boys would dieFor Dr Harry, the vital question was what cocktail of drugs to use to keep the boys unconscious but safe for the three hours it would take to get each of them to the surface.This kind of rescue had never been attempted before, so there was no rule book to follow. He decided on a combination of three drugs. First, he would give them a tablet of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to take the edge off their fear. Then he would inject ketamine into a leg muscle — five milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight — to put them to sleep.Ketamine acts fast but lasts only an hour. The recovery ers with each boy would then have to top them up with a pre-loaded syringe.The last drug, atropine, to reduce the saliva in the boys’ mouths from which they could drown, would also be injected into their legs.Dr Harry wasn’t confident the drugs would work. ‘I thought there was zero chance of success,’ he later admitted. Others involved were more upbeat, but even they thought that as many as five of the boys would die. Meanwhile, down in the cave, the Wild Boars were mentally preparing themselves. When they’d been told what was going to happen, they didn’t whimper or cry. They just accepted it. Whatever it took to get out of that cave was fine by them.Biw remembered thinking: ‘I’m coming out. I’m not afraid.’ A supply er suggested they should write messages to their parents that he would carry out ahead of them. He reasoned that if things didn’t go to plan, their families would at least get these final words from them.          All 12 players, pictured from top left clockwise, Adul Sam-on, 14, Panumas Saengdee, 13, Sompong Jaiwong, 13, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Pipat Bodhi, 15, Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, Pornchai Kamluang, 16, Prajak Sutham, 14, Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, Nattawut \u0027Tle\u0027 Takamsai, 14 and Duangpetch Promthep, 13On white graph paper, specially treated to survive getting wet, one boy wrote a message on behalf of all: ‘Don’t worry about us. When we get out we want to get home right away. Don’t give us too much homework.’ And then, each boy penned his own words. Little Titan, the youngest, wrote: ‘Get ready to take me to eat fried chicken.’SUNDAY, JULY 8, was D-Day and that morning the ers gathered for a final briefing. They had no idea if they would finish the day as heroes or be dealing with dead children. They ran through the specifics of the plan. Dr Harry would administer the sedation, then one of four recovery ers would take the unconscious boy and transport him through the flooded parts of the cave system. Support ers would be stationed in chambers between the sumps (passages in the cave that had filled with water) to perform medical and equipment checks, administer drug top-ups and carry each boy over dry sections.Around 10am, the recovery team entered the cave and made their way half-a-mile to what was designated as Chamber 3, where a base camp had been set up. Just before midday, they set off further into the mountain.Those left behind watched the glow of the ers’ torches fade away underwater. It would be five long hours before those in Chamber 3 had any idea if the operation had been a success. Meanwhile, on the muddy ledge where they had now been trapped for 16 days, the Wild Boars were working out who should be in the first party of four to go out.Dr Pak was satisfied that they were all in good health and strong enough to make the trip. When he asked for volunteers to lead the way, many hands shot up. He asked Coach Ek to decide.Ek selected Note, Tern, Nick and Night — on the basis that their homes were furthest away from the cave. ‘We planned that, once out, they would ride their bicycles home and let the other families know along the way.’His reasoning showed how little the Wild Boars understood of what was happening outside. They had no idea the whole world was watching and waiting, transfixed by the dramatic rescue operation.Fourteen-year-old Note was the first to go. He put on a wet suit and swallowed the sedative tablet he was given by Dr Pak to relax him.He walked down the slope to Dr Harry, and sat in his lap. The anaesthetist eased two prepared syringes into his legs and the boy fell into unconsciousness.He was then put into the rest of his ing gear and an air tank strapped to his front. The air was turned on and the all-important full-face mask fitted. After 30 seconds, Note began to breathe normally.The ers then handcuffed him, tying cable ties around his wrists and clipping them behind his back. This was to ensure that if he did wake up from his ketamine slumber, he wouldn’t try to rip off his face mask, endangering both his life and that of his rescuer.British er Jason Mallinson volunteered to go first with Note. He took hold of the harness strap on the boy’s back and submerged, holding him in roughly the same position as a strapped-together tandem skyer and instructor.          Thailand erupts in celebrations as trapped football team is freed from cave and rescue chief praises successful missionThen he began swimming cautiously through the first flooded tunnel. The initial stretch was a long one, about 350 yards, before Mallinson surfaced in the next chamber, where Craig Challen was waiting to do a medical check.Note’s inert body was manoeuvred out of the water onto dry land, his ing gear and tanks removed and he was dragged on a stretcher across the rocky floor to the next half-filled sump, where Mallinson reverted to the tandem technique.Plunging into the second sump, Mallinson felt his way along in the darkness, avoiding bumping the boy into stalactites and rocks at any cost. Protecting the child often meant taking a hit himself.The recovery ers all talked of bashing their helmets again and again into the cave ceiling, and using their bodies to protect their charges. The two biggest dangers under-water were the boy waking up and panicking, or his mask leaking and turning that plastic and silicone bubble of life over his face into a death trap. Preventing the mask from becoming dislodged was a constant concern.Mallinson slowly negotiated the narrowest gap of the e before coming to another tricky point where the tunnel went vertical and he had to find a way of posting the horizontal boy through.‘It was very daunting and very slow,’ he recalled, but he was making progress towards Chamber 6, the halfway point.There, two other ers waited for the tell-tale glow of a torch in the murky water. A silhouette emerged slowly from the flooded tunnel and Mallinson surfaced with his precious human cargo.The boy was breathing and alive. The plan was working. Once again Note was hauled onto dry land, his mask and tank removed, his breathing and saliva levels checked. Everything looked good. All the while the boy slept.          Jose Mourinho of Manchester United meets members of the Wild Boars football team from Thailand in October last year They put his gear back on him and then Mallinson sank back into the brown murk with him. Diving and wading, he carried Note through the rest of the flooded cave until he reached Chamber 3, the command centre, where eager hands were waiting to haul the boy out of the water.A medical team checked him over before loading him onto a special rescue stretcher made of plastic so it could glide easily over rock. They hoisted him up a steep slope and down the other side.More than 100 people were involved in this game of pass-the-parcel as the stretcher was carried, floated through a half-filled sump, carried, floated through another, and passed on again.Slowed by the drugs, the unconscious boy’s breathing was shallow and difficult. A rescuer whispered encouragement. ‘You’re almost there!’ As Note emerged into the world, a cheer went up among the rescue workers and spread backwards, like a wave, through the tunnel, a moment of happiness and relief. They’d done it.Now, just 12 more to go.BACK IN the cave, 14-year-old Tern had watched his schoolmate Note go bravely down the slope to the edge of the water. Now it was his turn. The injections knocked him out quickly and he was kitted up for the e.British er John Volanthen had the momentous task of guiding the boy through. For days, he had been mentally preparing himself for the horrible possibility of ‘taking a live child underwater and bringing out a corpse’.He descended into the water, holding Tern close.Next to go was 15-year-old Nick, who was not even a member of the Wild Boars football team. He had gone along on the trip to spend time with his best friend, Biw. Nick was supervised by another Briton, Rick Stanton, who gripped the back of the boy’s harness. ‘They were basically packages with a handle, like a shopping bag,’ Stanton recalled.          The 11th boy to have been rescued was reportedly 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungruang (second left), whose nickname is TitanOnce underwater, he reached out his other hand for the guide rope and started the journey.So far, so good. The rescue was going well. But there was always a nervous moment at the start. Each time an anaesthetised boy entered the water, he would stop breathing for about 30 seconds.Most were fine but Night, the next boy to go, reacted badly to the drugs. His breathing was irregular and Dr Harry lay with him on the ground holding his airway open. It was half an hour before the boy started to recover and was ready to go. Night was given another shot and taken back into the water by Somerset-based er Chris Jewell, who was in awe of how brave all the boys were.‘They did everything right in order to make it possible for us to rescue them,’ he said. ‘I never saw a whimper or a tear in the eye. They were extremely calm, strong, determined young men.’By 9pm, the first day’s operation was over. All four boys had been carried through the flooded tunnels and all emerged safely.Helicoptered to hospital, they were placed in a sterile ward and — to their disappointment — restricted to a bland hospital diet at first. They’d presumed they’d be eating home-cooked food and sleeping in their own beds. Divers like Chris Jewell were euphoric, though their joy was mixed with the knowledge that they were going to have go through the stressful process again and again before the rescue was complete. ‘The ing wasn’t going to get any easier,’ he said.Nonetheless, the next day another four boys were successfully brought to the surface.There were problems. One started to wake as Jason Mallinson was swimming him through a partially flooded passage, and the er had to inject him while also controlling the boy in the water.           The mission to rescue the final four boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave  seen here in a picture posted on Twitter by US billionaire Elon Musk‘It was very tricky,’ Mallinson recalled. ‘I had syringes floating around on the surface, just trying to grab hold of them.’Fortunately, the boys remembered none of these perilous moments. The ketamine disconnected their thoughts from their physical reality, and some went off into vivid dreams.So it was eight out and five to go — but a growing threat was now hanging over the rest. Weather forecasters were warning of heavy storms approaching — the sort of monsoonal downpour that had trapped the Wild Boars in the cave in the first place.It could leave the remaining five stuck in that airless pocket two-and-a-half miles inside the mountain. The rescuers must move fast to bring them out.The next morning the ers were edgy as they assembled outside the cave. Overnight it had rained heavily, and it was still raining. The cave system was filling up again and time was short. Would their luck hold?Of the five left in the cave, Coach Ek went first on the final rescue day. His face was gaunt after 18 days of keeping the boys calm and together in the darkness, teaching them meditation, encouraging them to conserve energy.Next was Tee, oldest of the players, who somehow got snagged on a wire in the tunnel. John Volanthen remembered having to ‘park’ the boy on the bottom of the flooded cave while he cut away the wire and freed his legs.This incident confirmed the value of sedation. There was little chance of a conscious person staying calm and still if they became entangled and their rescue er left them on the cave floor.          Thousands of rescuers including Thai Navy SEALs and elite British ers had been working around the clock to come up with a plan to bring the exhausted and starved boys home safelyTitan, the youngest and second-smallest boy, went next, followed by Pong. Then it was time for Mark, the smallest and the last. Each day he had waited, desperate to get out of the miserable cave, but there was never a face-mask small enough to fit him tightly to seal out the water.One that might work had been found overnight and brought into the cave. No one could be absolutely sure it would do the job, but there was no choice.The ers would have to be extra careful not to bump him against a rock and flood his breathing apparatus — a task that had become even more challenging as, churned up by the day’s traffic, the visibility in the sumps was now practically zero.Mark got his jabs, went to sleep in his tiny wetsuit and, like the others, was brought out without a hitch. It was all over. All 13 Wild Boars had been saved and were remarkably well. Here was the fairytale ending that everyone had prayed for and worked so hard for but didn’t think possible.Outside, there were jubilant scenes. Support workers lined up to cheer and yell ‘thank you’ as each of the ers and rescue workers walked out of the cave. Parents came forward to hug them. At their camp, the SEALs, who’d led the operation from the start, sang, danced and whooped.Job done, the international team of ers that had come together to save the boys went their separate ways. Life moved on.Yet this was a story that had touched the hearts of so many people around the world. It had it all: a misadventure we could all relate to children trapped and hungry the race against time the water rising, falling the world sending its best and bravest the tragedy of an unexpected death.Then the dramatic rescue, playing out bit by bit somehow pulling off what seemed impossible and giving the world a moment of much-needed happiness.At a time when the news cycle was so often full of violence, meanness and stupidity, here was something we could all get behind. For once, we were all united in hope. We were all on Team Wild Boars and we’d all won. Adapted by Tony Rennell from The Cave by Liam Cochrane, published by ABC Books at £15.99.

By fostering a passion for wildlife, we can turn the tide on degradation • Vote for Australia’s best beachesAustralia has so many beaches, you could visit a different one every day for 30 years if you chose to – 10,685 around the mainland and Tasmanian coasts alone, according to the University of Sydney’s coastal studies unit.In fact, when you include all 8,222 islands, the entire coastline stretches over 59,736km – this adds up to a great deal of beaches, rocky coves, cliffs, headlands, estuaries, rock pools, sand dunes and mangroves that provide a habitat for an abundance of wildlife.“Why is it important to partake in nature experiences along our beaches?” you may ask. Aside from satisfying curiosity about the natural world and whiling away pleasant summer afternoons, the reasons are severalfold.Furthermore, particularly in children, experiencing nature encourages a greater interest in conservation and in making environmentally friendly decisions in everyday life. This has never been more important, as our beaches face unprecedented perils.Sydney alone has more than 100 beaches, offering for the city’s five million inhabitants a remarkable and often under-appreciated opportunity to engage with nature. It is unusual for a major global city to have relative wilderness just a short distance from its built-up centre.Here and on beaches across Australia’s temperate south, the intertidal zone teems with life – this is the narrow zone submerged at high tide and exposed to the air at low tide.Peering into rock pools and exploring the rock platforms here can reveal soldier crabs, ghost crabs, purple sea urchins, various sea stars, colourful anemones and even southern blue-ringed octopuses.The seemingly endless ersity of molluscs include pipis, cockles, snails, limpets and oysters, while frequent finds among the surf debris include the gas-filled floats of bluebottles, cuttlebones and the spiral egg cases of Port Jackson sharks.Birds are equally abundant, from cormorants, pelicans and little penguins to shorebirds and waders such as oystercatchers, plovers, sandpipers and lapwings.Sadly, as Australia’s population grows, beachside environments face many challenges. While water quality has improved at many beaches as deep ocean outfalls now carry sewage effluent far offshore (at Sydney’s Bondi and Malabar beaches, for example), and protected species status for some coastal creatures, such as saltwater crocodiles, mean their populations have rebounded from historic lows, other problems have reached crisis point.Development, habitat loss, agricultural runoff, disruption of seabird nesting sites and four-wheel driving on beaches – as well as shark nets, drumlines and culling programs – are just some of the problems that now beset our coast. Climate change is driving a series of threats, including marine heatwaves, an increasing severity of storms and rising sea levels.There are also arguments that some of Australia’s most famous beaches, including those on Fraser Island and at Noosa on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, are being loved to death. In early January, gridlock at Hyams Beach (billed as having the world’s whitest sand) in the Shoalhaven, New South Wales, saw tourists turned away after thousands of cars overwhelmed the area’s 400-vehicle capacity.Australian beaches are more pristine than in many parts of the world, but plastic pollution has still reached epidemic levels, according to conservation group Tangaroa Blue Foundation. Surveys it has coordinated over 14 years have recorded more than 10m pieces of debris at 2,460 sites around the coastline, adding up to about 878 tonnes of rubbish – three-quarters of which is plastic.This plastic can range from drinking straws and plastic bottles to small fragments that clog the guts of seabirds, right up to discarded fishing nets. One study found that 9,000 of the ghost nets, found on beaches and in waters around Australia’s Top End, had likely resulted in the death of between 4,866 and 14,600 turtles.The best way to reduce some of this pollution is to educate people and make them care enough not to discard plastics and other waste. Getting out and appreciating the nature along our coast and fostering in children a love of the wildlife they encounter is a significant step towards a brighter environmental future. Some of Australia’s most awe-inspiring wildlife experiences can be found along our beaches. For me, these have included standing in the surf at Western Australia’s Monkey Mia reserve as Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins cruised through the shallows hearing the deep rumbling vocalisations of saltwater crocodiles in the Kimberley’s remote Uunguu Indigenous protected area watching green turtles forage and surface for air at the Low Isles on the Great Barrier Reef and seeing dingoes stroll the sand and the silhouettes of sharks patroll the waves at Fraser Island.Elsewhere, you can feed stingrays or swim among them at WA’s Hamelin Bay, walk past nesting seabirds at Queensland’s Lady Elliot Island, watch little penguins return to roost at Phillip Island near Melbourne, take a guided walk through a colony of sea lions at South Australia’s Kangaroo Island, or chance upon kangaroos lazing on the sand at numerous locations, including Pebbly Beach at Jervis Bay.So, next time you’re down at the beach, spend a bit of time looking out for the magnificent wildlife that surrounds you – and let it inspire you to take every step you can to diminish your impact on Australia’s incredible environment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adebbdfd4106e56cd20db0084fd38cf54cf72ed7/0_87_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc5ecf4579cd4304bd1da75efb8019","title":"a star is born ts eliot prize goes to hannah sullivans debut","story":"Poet’s ‘absolutely exhilarating’ first collection Three Poems takes £25,000 prize Poet Hannah Sullivan has won the prestigious and lucrative TS Eliot prize for her first collection Three Poems – just the third debut to land the award in its 25-year history, and a sign that the poetry world is hunting for a new generation of voices.Sullivan, a 39-year-old Londoner who won the £25,000 prize on Monday night, is the third first time poet to take the prize, with all three winning in the last five years: Vietnamese-American Ocean Vuong in 2017 and Chinese-British Sarah Howe in 2015. Before then, the prize had tended to be awarded to more established poets a few collections into their careers, among them Derek Walcott, Carol Ann Duffy, Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney.Sullivan, who studied at Cambridge and Harvard, worked as an assistant professor at Stanford, and is now associate professor of English at New College, Oxford. She is unusual in that she had not been widely published in the lead-up to her debut.“A star is born. Where has she come from?” said chair of judges, poet and previous winner Sinéad Morrissey. “I don’t know her personally, I hadn’t read her in magazines or anywhere else before. She has not come through the usual creative-writing, pamphlet route. She has just arrived, and it is breathtaking. I couldn’t be more delighted if I had won it myself.”Sullivan’s debut is made up of three lengthy poems: You, Very Young in New York, which explores the lives of various young people, all united by their cynicism and their uncertainty, making their way through unfulfilling relationships and work in the city Repeat Until Time is an exploration of revision in art and form, Sullivan’s PhD subject the third, The Sandpit After Rain explores connections between the birth of her baby and the death of her father.Morrissey said the decision to award Sullivan the prize was unanimous. “Our relationship with her work only deepened on each subsequent rereading,” she said. “It is not just the formal mastery, but how that formal mastery is so well-handled as to be almost invisible. That is the height of praise. You almost don’t notice the architecture underneath because you are so compelled by what is being said.”She called Three Poems hugely ambitious: “It is taking on perennial themes such as our mortality, our sexuality, our gender and our movement through time and place, and doing it in such a fresh and observant way. It is an absolutely exhilarating collection and it is all the more surprising that it is a debut.”Sullivan was one of five new voices on a 10-book shortlist described as “intensely political” by judge and poet Clare Pollard. More established names included the US poet Terrance Hayes, nominated for his collection American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin, an exploration of the modern news cycle written in immediate response to the first 200 days of Donald Trump’s presidency the current US poet laureate Tracy K Smith for Wade in the Water, a collection that touches on slavery and black American history former winner Sean O’Brien’s Europa, which considers the relationship between the UK and Europe and Nick Laird’s Feel Free, which explores recent news events including Grenfell Tower and the refugee crisis.Morrissey said the presence of so many new voices was exciting. “There is such tremendous energy coming from people writing their first books right now. So many of the debuts were not only accomplished, but testing the boundaries of their fields. It is a really exciting moment for poetry, because it feels like publishers are taking more chances, and we’re now reading a more erse and experimental field.”From The Sandpit After Rain by Hannah Sullivan4.3Tears and liver spots on the back of the hand,The comfort again and again of writing something fictional down.All cancers were once benign,Then the DNA forgets its prosodyAnd cells ide interminably:The raddled beauty of doggerel.Stained under a microscope,An ovary is Venice at sunset,‘Too beautiful to be painted’ said Monet.Midas-touched sperm, bulging and fanning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/613d055416859f76a1ec00218f2261d6850823a9/0_0_5390_3234/master/5390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7e7ecfec372f657e048d162830a825a","title":"10 french adventures to have with your children","story":"Easily accessible and offering everything from rolling hills and stunning beaches to theme parks and culinary delights, France is a playground for all the family. Here are 10 French experiences to share with your children Explore William the Conqueror’s NormandyMake history lessons come to life in Normandy with visits to sites including Bayeux and its famous 70-metre tapestry. You can also explore William the Conqueror’s key stronghold of Caen with its impressive château and other historic buildings. Don’t miss L’abbaye aux Hommes and L’abbaye aux Dames, commissioned by William as an apology to the Church for marrying without its official blessing.Go kayaking in the DordogneThe Dordogne offers plenty of gentle kayaking suitable for families. There are many sites along the river where you can hire boats and be picked up at a pre-arranged location according to how far you want to paddle. Depending on your route you’re likely to pass châteaux, wildlife and river beaches where you can stop for a picnic or a swim.Go narrow boating on the Canal du MidiEnjoy life in the slow lane as you cruise along the Canal du Midi from Toulouse to Montpellier. Explore picturesque villages and historic Carcassonne along the way, visit markets, do some fishing or cycling, visit local vineyards in the Languedoc, or simply sunbathe and relax.Cycle the voies vertes of the LoireThere are over 932 miles (1,500km) of voies vertes (cycle trails or greenways) in the Loire. The flat landscape is ideal for families and most rental shops offer tag-alongs and trailers for small children. Along the way you can explore gardens, châteaux and pretty villages and towns. Rent bikes for a day and cycle independently or book a hotel-to-hotel package with luggage transfer – it’s up to you.Climb Mont St MichelFirst inhabited in 966 by Benedictine monks and over half a mile off the coast, this small island with a population of about 50 people welcomes up to 2.5 million visitors every year. There are shops, restaurants, churches and museums to visit, as well as 350 steps up to the beautifully restored medieval monastery and its stunning views.Explore volcanoes in the AuvergneThere are around 100 volcanic peaks in the Auvergne. There’s plenty of hiking available (both gentle and more challenging), but you can also reach the top of the most famous peak Puy de Dôme at 1,465 metres by electric railway, from where you can enjoy panoramic views. Kids will also enjoy Vulcania, an educational theme park devoted to volcanoes.Go to a theme parkDisneyland Paris is France’s best-known theme park but there are many others – Parc Astérix in the Oise celebrates the comic book hero of the same name, while Futuroscope near Poitiers offers rides and shows based on the latest technology. Puy du Fou in the Vendée is different again – it’s a historical theme park with no rides, instead it puts on dozens of spectacular shows every day.Learn to surf in Aquitaine With an almost unbroken line of long, wide, sandy beaches, often with large waves along this coast, Aquitaine is the ideal place to learn to surf with plenty of surf schools offering lessons for all ages. Smaller children don’t need to feel left out though – on many beaches, when the tide goes out, the sea leaves warm, sandy lagoons to splash in and rockpools to explore.Relax in a thermal spa in the PyreneesIn France, spas aren’t just for adults, the kids get to go too! Children are welcome at many of the naturally-heated indoor and outdoor spas in the Pyrenees. Les Bains du Couloubret in Ax-les-Thermes, Ariège, welcomes children from the age of five and Balnéa in Loudenvielle accepts babies from nine months old, with both indoor and outdoor pools just for families.Eat crêpes in BrittanyWho doesn’t love a pancake? Breton crêpes are thin, light and crispy at the edges and come in both sweet and savoury versions. You can eat them just as they come (nature, as they say in France) or with a filling of your choice. Sweet fillings include sugar or honey and a popular savoury option is the galette complète, with ham, Gruyère cheese and egg.

The flights are from Lisbon to Hong Kong via London. A flight departing early in the morning was listed for $16,000 (£12,450) but taking the same route at midday cost only $1,512 (£1,175).A Cathay spokeswoman said a “very small number” of customers had been able to buy the fares at the vastly discounted prices and it looked “forward to welcoming you in board to enjoy our premium services”. The airline said it stopped sales as soon as the error was highlighted by the South China Morning Post journalist Danny Lee, who did not buy a ticket himself. The airline said it was urgently “looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors”. It comes less than two weeks after a similar error allowed people to buy business and first-class tickets from Vietnam to New York for $675 (£534), rather than the standard $16,000.The airline also promised to honour that error. “Happy 2019 all, and to those who bought our good – VERY good surprise ‘special’ on New Year’s Day,” the airline tweeted. “Yes – we made a mistake, but we look forward to welcoming you onboard with your ticket issued.

Come summer, Alberta’s five national parks become the perfect backdrop for everything from wildlife spotting, cycling and rock climbing to rafting and gazing at the stars in one of the region’s dark sky preserves. But beyond the mountains, you’ll find both small-town charm, such as Lake Louise inside Banff National Park, and cosmopolitan buzz in Alberta’s urban hubs, Calgary and Edmonton.Besides the mountains, the province’s other great natural feature is its prairies. Alberta is cowboy country, and that means beef – namely Alberta’s famous AAA beef – is a staple of menus across the province. Head to the Longview Steakhouse, where the setting is casual but the food hearty and high-end, for a quintessentially Albertan experience with valley views. Or dine amid the forest at Tekarra. This log cabin, perched above the Athabasca River near Jasper, has been serving illustrious patrons, including Marilyn Monroe, since 1952.A new star in the contemporary culinary scene is Deane House. Set in a century-old Calgary mansion, dishes focus on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Or tuck into the tastiest trattoria-style food at Bread \u0026amp Circus, nominated as one of Canada’s best new restaurants in 2018. And if you want to buy produce, you’re in luck – Edmontonians love a farmers’ market, with no less than 16 held weekly during the summer.It’s not just the restaurants making the most of locally sourced ingredients craft beer and spirits are booming, as entrepreneurs also make use of Alberta’s natural larder. Head to the Park Distillery in Banff for the aptly named Glacier Rye whisky, made with glacier water from Banff National Park. The multi-award-winning Eau Claire – makers of Alberta’s first craft single malt whisky – uses ingredients harvested from farms in southern Alberta.Edmonton’s nickname as “festival city” is well-earned. No matter the season, there’s a festival in town. The Edmonton International Fringe Festival – the largest, longest running fringe festival in North America – is held each August. Watch the streets of Old Strathcona fill with performers, from circus acts to standup comedians. Calgary, too, is no slouch when it comes to getting into the party spirit – it even has its own Music Mile, a mile-long stretch of 9th Avenue SE bursting with music venues, including the Ironwood Stage and Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre. But long before there was a city here in Alberta, bison roamed, and First Nations people lived off the land. Take in 6,000 years of plains culture at the evocatively and aptly named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump cliff. The Unesco world heritage site, 14 miles west of Fort Macleod, was an important hunting site for First Nations communities. Today a visitor centre houses prehistoric artefacts and offers tours of the site.A tri-area lift ticket gets you access to Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village – revered by skiers and boarders worldwide as one of the top places in the world to seek out feather-light snow. For the more adventurous, Fortress Mountain, located on the Kananaskis Trail, 70 miles west of Calgary, offers skiers and riders of intermediate-plus level the chance to go in search of virgin snow. Head to Castle Mountain to go cat-skiing, where you’ll have access to untouched powder so dry and light it’s nicknamed “liquid smoke”.If you’re after a more tranquil experience, take to the water in summer. Rent a canoe or kayak in Banff National Park and explore the waterways of the Bow Valley, including 40 Mile Creek and Vermilion Lakes. Or ride the backcountry mountain trails on horseback, camping out in the wilderness with a riding holiday.Alberta’s ski-heaven winters and fine summers may draw the crowds, but make no mistake, one of the best times to visit is autumn. Take a hike up to Larch Valley in late September, starting at the unbelievably photogenic Moraine Lake , to see the trees turn a flaming yellow amid the wisps of the season’s first snow. The two-and-a-half-mile hike will take you from the spectacular turquoise waters backed by the ice-capped Valley of Ten Peaks, up to a high alpine meadow. Then there’s stargazing in Jasper, where you’ll find one of the world’s largest dark sky preserves. Every October, the Dark Sky Festival holds a number of events from symphonies under the stars to rocket building workshops.Of course, winter is magical in the Rockies. And that’s not just because of the skiing: stave off the January blues in Banff with the 11-day long Snow Days Festival, centred around massive snow sculptures in downtown Banff. Or head to Lake Louise for the Ice Magic Festival, as international ice-carving teams compete to create giant sculptures on the frozen lake.Discover more adventures throughout the year in Alberta with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b74b6272422b66d5c67fd25af84f8d7395d559/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c34de9c9550385e95b6e0ca9366e3e","title":"meet the exeter university youtuber proving the value of connectivity","story":"Being always-on has its plus side. As third-year psychology student Selina Ozay knows, a digital platform can provide powerful opportunities to give back to the communityThere are many things that define the student experience. Getting up before 7am isn’t typically one of them.However, Selina Ozay, a 20-year-old psychology undergraduate at the University of Exeter, isn’t a typical student. As well as preparing for her finals, Ozay runs her own YouTube channel, on which she has built a following of more than 8,000 subscribers by vlogging about uni life, study tips and fashion.It’s a juggling act that requires early starts. But while this might be off-putting for many university students, it fits with Ozay’s personality. Admitting that she didn’t put heaps of effort into her GCSE exams – “I didn’t think they were that important” – she explains she got her act together during her A-levels, and has organised every aspect of her life since.“I’m a massive fan of lists and schedules, and I literally plan everything hour to hour,” she says. “I don’t always stick to it, but it comforts me to have a plan for the day.”With a workload as ambitious as hers, making the most of every moment is essential. For Ozay, learning to manage both a growing YouTube career and an engaged student life (she’s also general secretary of the University of Exeter’s Vegetarian and Vegan Society) has paid off, with her social-media presence leading to friendships and even campus-celebrity status.“Things are a bit more personal online,” she says. Despite claims that social media is killing off real, personal connections, she’s found that being online allows her to “launch into talking about deeper issues straight away”, skipping the shallow pleasantries of face-to-face chit-chat and building meaningful relationships from the jump.“On my YouTube channel I’m really open about being stressed or anything going on in my personal life,” she continues, “so people know me in a different way.” Because of this, connectivity has become Ozay’s lifeblood. An unimaginable amount of content is uploaded to YouTube every day so, to stay ahead of the latest trends, she has to keep a close eye on what her fellow vloggers are putting out there.Her YouTube channel covers everything from how to make friends to dealing with the stress of studying, and she presents an honest and relatable picture of university life. In response, fellow students frequently stop her on campus to tell her what an inspiration she is. “It still shocks me,” she says of her online celebrity.What makes Ozay special is the fact that she doesn’t necessarily see some things that others would call work as work. Describing her morning routine (which, on a good day, begins at 5:30am), she insists she doesn’t do any work prior to starting her lectures, before revealing that she will check emails and deal with her Vegetarian Society responsibilities during this time. In addition, Ozay completes a daily morning workout, which she says is very helpful for managing her stress levels. “I do yoga, so it’s very much about being mindful and focusing on breathing, and it does help me calm down.”The rest of her day is split between YouTube and uni. “It does take up a lot of time. It’s the editing that takes up the most. I just spent three hours editing a vlog in the library. That’s three hours I could spend revising.”There’s not a hint of complaint in Ozay’s tone as she waxes lyrical about her busy life. It’s her passion for helping people that drives her, whether it’s posting study vlogs to YouTube or preparing for a future as a therapist, her current post-university ambition. “I’ve always felt it came naturally to me,” she says of her desire to support others. “I’m a very empathetic person. I cry very easily and I feel what other people are feeling very easily.”A lot is said about the always-on generation, but Ozay proves that it’s the person that makes the (social media) presence, not the other way around. By channelling her driven and caring personality into her online communities, she has created a digital space where friendships can form and support can be found.

The designer’s ready-to-wear collections, however, have quite a specific man in mind and at the brand’s autumnwinter 2019 show in Milan on Monday, he emerged as an intrepid urban explorer of the jet-set variety.The house explained that the collection was “designed for a hybrid habitat”, which is “sporty but urban at its core”. It demonstrated this with velour tracksuit-style suiting, slouchy hoodies worn under stricter tailoring, and grounding each outfit with trainers or polished leather hiking boots.When Emporio Armani Man is not in the city in his sharp suits, he’s skiing or snowboarding, and this collection has him well kitted out for both.Designing for this guy is essentially what Armani does best and, while it may not hold the widespread appeal of those other more accessible products, it pays off. Forbes ranks the 84-year-old designer as No 174 on its list of billionaires in 2018, estimating his net worth at $7.6bn (£5.9bn).At Fendi later in the day was another hybrid of sorts as its creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, took on the roles of creator and subject for the first time. The show was a tribute to the German designer (who also heads up Chanel as well as his eponymous brand), intended to celebrate “close to a lifetime of mentorship and mutual respect” between the Fendi family and its adopted designer of more than 50 years.As such, Lagerfeld could, quite literally, be seen all over this collection. A drawing of his unmistakable ponytailed profile was one of the many doodles to adorn shirts, trenchcoats and a huge quilted puffa coat. It was an apt season-defining detail given that the 85-year-old is famed for his sketches and having his pencil case close to hand at all times.“Dualism is in the DNA of Fendi, under every form,” said his co-designer, Silvia Venturini Fendi, pointing to their long-term collaboration and the other prominent concept in this collection. It was realised in two-tone tailoring which fused wool-tweed with silk-organza, zip detailing which split knitwear and jackets down the back, and the house’s interlocking F logo, which was calligraphic on a long duster coat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc767fd5ea08e97ab8b34b1c39e8e66bbfa899d/0_406_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b02398149e772a871af0fdb27b869b5e","title":"danny dyer discovers more royal ancestry with french king saint louis","story":"Actor finds out about devout ancestor in Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family on BBC OneIn the last 12 months Danny Dyer has called David Cameron a “twat” on live television, watched his daughter win Love Island and delivered Channel 4’s Alternative Christmas Message.Now there may be a simple explanation for the actor’s elevation to national treasure status: he is the descendant of a saint.The EastEnders actor made the discovery while filming Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family, which airs on 23 January on BBC One.Among other revelations, the actor is told that his 26th great-grandfather is the French King Louis IX, a devout religious leader who died in 1270 and was later canonised as Saint Louis. Dr Emily Guerry, a medieval historian, told Dyer that his distant ancestor at one point wore the robes of a humble monk to lead a procession through Paris honouring the arrival of a religious relic purported to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ at his crucifixion.To commemorate his ancestor’s actions, Dyer recreated the walk through the French capital barefoot.The actor, who has previously established a blood connection to the English rulers William the Conqueror and Edward III, said he was impressed to discover his new relation. “I can be told all sorts of information but to actually walk in King Louis IX’s footsteps, to think that he did this as a king, I admire him because he does exactly as he preaches and is showing everybody. He walked for six miles barefoot, in pain, and that you’ve got to respect. Considering the money and power he had and the life he could have lived, I think it’s very brave. Bless him.”After being told that Louis was later elevated to sainthood after a series of miracles, Dyer said: “It’s just so much to take in. I’m related to a saint.” He said it was hard to believe sacred blood was “coursing through my veins”.However, Dyer may not be alone. Dr Adam Rutherford, the author of a book on genes entitled A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived, said the passage of time and overlapping ancestries meant “there is a time in history where all lines of all family trees cross through all people”, meaning many Britons of European ancestry are likely to be descended from Saint Louis.Rutherford added: “Every European is descended from every European alive in the 10th century, if they have any living descendants. We know from his royal pedigree that Charlemagne has living descendants (Richard Branson boasted of it, Christopher Lee, too), which means that literally every European is also descended from Charlemagne.“The basic problem is that we think of family trees fanning out from us into the past, but that means that the number of ancestors we have doubles every generation back. By 1,000 years ago, every person has more ancestors than people who have ever existed.”Despite this, he said, it was impressive that Dyer had been able to follow his ancestry back this far and prove the connection to the French king.King Louis IX, who led the seventh crusade to the Middle East, was canonised by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297 and lent his named to many settlements around the world, including the US city of St Louis in Missouri. Dyer has yet to have any settlements named after him, nor has he led an armed intervention in the Holy Land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be693a7479516cb89bab67d645ca8c7d859f33b4/573_89_4303_2583/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35a504927506b5315b685c72fd6e1d13","title":"david wagner leaves huddersfield manager mutual consent","story":"David Wagner has left his job as manager of Huddersfield Town, the Premier League’s bottom club, after a fraught first five months of the season in which they have slid eight points adrift of safety.Huddersfield said the decision had been reached by mutual consent after discussions with Wagner, who had been in charge since November 2015. His departure comes as a considerable surprise, with a remarkable set of achievements at the John Smith’s Stadium having spared him intense scrutiny during their second top-flight campaign, and the club’s chairman, Dean Hoyle, said Wagner had instigated the move himself.“I had no intention of sacking David this season,” Hoyle said. “Subsequently David – being the great man he is – came to us and made it clear that he needs a break from the rigours of football management.“We discussed making that change immediately, but he also made it clear that he would give his all for the rest of this season before departing in the summer if we preferred. After a long discussion we all felt that David staying at the club until the end of the season was best, but we’ve kept discussions open and we all now feel that the time is right to part ways.”Hoyle stressed that the term “mutual consent” meant exactly that, calling it a “truly joint decision”. He continued: “David has a real, genuine love for this club and, like me, his foremost concern in our talks has been to establish what is best for Huddersfield Town.”Very few of Huddersfield’s staff had expected the news and, upon the announcement of Wagner’s exit, the atmosphere around the club was one of shock. The affable Wagner earned hero status after arriving from Borussia Dortmund’s second team, leading the Terriers to promotion in 2016-17 and ending their 45-year exile from the top ision. They achieved that despite one of the lowest playing budgets in the Championship, succeeding in stunning fashion with a relentless, high-pressing brand of football.Last season they stayed up against all odds, draws at Manchester City and Chelsea securing their survival with a game to spare. Things have been tougher this time around however, Saturday’s goalless draw at Cardiff halting a run of eight straight league defeats but doing little to suggest a squad built with relatively meagre resources can complete a second great escape.“It’s a very sad day, but now we have to look to the future that’s what football and our immediate situation demands,” Hoyle said. Mark Hudson, formerly Huddersfield’s captain and now a member of the coaching staff, will oversee Sunday’s home game against Manchester City, after which the next manager’s task may look more ominous.Sam Allardyce, Slavisa Jokanovic and David Moyes are early names to find favour with bookmakers and the club are already in the process of identifying potential appointments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/760667e8d308de0dfbec1981f6a85abd602d93b3/0_0_2819_1691/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f795168a1b892c48188f8638170c29cf","title":"harry kane tottenham ankle injury month out","story":"• Joint too swollen for scan on injury suffered in loss to United• Hugo Lloris says Kane is important but ‘you have to adapt’Harry Kane fears he may be absent for at least a month as Tottenham wait for the swelling around the England captain’s injured ankle to subside before scanning the joint.The striker hobbled away from Wembley on Sunday after hurting an ankle towards the end of the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United.The area is too swollen for Spurs to examine properly and ascertain the extent of the damage. But, while the club are understandably reluctant to put a timescale on his anticipated absence, Kane is concerned he may not be fit for the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie with Borussia Dortmund next month.The 25-year-old has endured ankle problems in each of the last three years, missing seven weeks in the autumn of 2016, and, armed with that experience, it is understood he is braced for an absence of at least four weeks. That would rule him out of the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea next Thursday Spurs also play four Premier League matches and an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Crystal Palace in the next month.Dortmund visit Wembley on 13 February with the return fixture in the first week in March.The impact of Kane’s injury is compounded by Son Heung-min’s departure to play for South Korea in the Asian Cup, where his involvement could extend until the end of January. “These two guys are just massive for us,” said Jan Vertonghen. “Especially over the last couple of months they’ve been immense. We hope they’ll both be back soon. It’s one of those things but the other guys have to stand up now.”Spurs are investigating an alleged incident of racism directed at Son by one of their own supporters on Sunday, having been alerted to an incident by a season-ticket holder.In Kane’s absence Mauricio Pochettino has ruled out turning to Vincent Janssen, who is not in his plans, but will be left with Fernando Llorente – who has attracted interest this month from his former club Athletic Bilbao – and Lucas Moura as striker options. The Brazilian may recover from a knee injury to face Fulham on Sunday.“We all know how important Harry is in our team but he is not all of our team,” said the Spurs captain, Hugo Lloris. “Football is about the team and every player is ready to help the team. In football during the season you have ups and downs and you have to always adapt to those, and we will see about ‘H’.“It is better when you have all your best players on the field but that can happen here or it can happen at other clubs.

Pep Guardiola’s team made that clear when Liverpool came here two Thursdays ago and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions are quite happy playing this game of catch-up – for now, at least.By the time they were finished the gap at the top had come back down to four points, Gabriel Jesus had fully justified Guardiola’s decision to keep him in the starting lineup and the goalkeeper, Ederson, had been impudent enough to stroll out of City’s penalty area and nonchalantly start to stroke around the ball in midfield. The crowd loved those moments and, briefly, it did seem to cross Ederson’s mind that he might continue those little one-twos even further upfield and join everybody else in the hunt for more goals. Do not bet against it happening at some point.The only surprise, perhaps, was that City did not do more to enhance their goal difference – now plus-42 compared with Liverpool’s plus-40 – once Jesus had scored twice in the first half, either side of Willy Boly’s red card for a studs-to-ankle challenge on Bernardo Silva. Two ahead against 10 men, City coasted through the second half but restricted themselves to only one more goal, courtesy of the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, inadvertently turning a deflected cross into his own net.To say it was comfortable would be an understatement and, in the process, City kept up their record of having scored at least twice in every home game this season. Their next goal will be their 100th in all competitions in 2018-19 and it is another measure of their firepower that they could win so convincingly on a night when Sergio Agüero and Kevin de Bruyne were restricted to substitute roles.At the same time it is also fair to say Wolves were obliging opponents for a side with City’s needs. Boly did at least apologise to Silva and, in days gone by, the defender would probably have had a reasonable defence that he took the ball first. Unfortunately for Boly, he ought to have realised that is no mitigation in modern football when the follow-through involves studs connecting with a player’s ankle. City were already leading at that point and the Frenchman’s red card meant the night swiftly became an exercise in damage limitation for the away side.Jesus had opened the scoring with a close-range finish from Leroy Sané’s low delivery, a goal that originated from a beautifully weighted pass forward by Aymeric Laporte, and when the Brazilian doubled the lead with a penalty six minutes before half-time it meant he had accumulated seven goals in eight days.Did Ryan Bennett make enough contact on Raheem Sterling to warrant the decision? Sterling was travelling at speed, darting past Bennett and Coady, and he does occasionally tend to make the most of any form of contact inside the penalty area. Yet it was a clumsy effort from Bennett, who missed the ball, and ultimately Sterling was too quick for him. Jesus came forward, stuttering his run-up and sidefooted his kick past Rui Patrício in the Wolves goal.Boly’s early departure meant Leander Dendoncker moving into a more defensive role and the visitors switching to a 5-2-2 system with little hope but to defend robustly and try to catch their opponents on the break. Truthfully, however, a side with 10 men was bound to be vulnerable against City’s pass-them-to-death approach. City have not been defeated by a promoted side in 35 attempts, going back to February 2007 against Reading, and Wolves have not won here in the top ision since December 1979.At least the Wolves fans had not lost their sense of humour, greeting every touch with “olés” during one passage early in the second half when the 10 men reminded themselves what it was like to keep the ball for a couple of minutes. No longer than that, mind. City soon had it back and set about re-establishing their superiority, keeping their first clean sheet in 10 league fixtures.Instead Wolves had to repel a City side for whom Sané was excellent, Ederson was rarely troubled and David Silva established himself as the club’s highest appearance-maker in the Premier League era. This was the Spaniard’s 267th league appearance in City’s colours, taking him above Joe Hart from the modern era – though still some way short of the proper club record, set by Alan Oakes with 564 games from 1959 to 1976.Silva was replaced by De Bruyne on the hour and it was the Belgian’s cross that led to the third goal. Romain Saïss, one of the Wolves substitutes, headed it towards his own goal but the final touch came off Coady to benefit a City side that now have Huddersfield, Burnley and Newcastle, all in the bottom six, as their next three assignments. February looks trickier, starting with back-to-back games against Arsenal and Chelsea, but it is fair to say Liverpool must be acutely aware of the team looming in their wing mirrors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4cdfe957b85f59f7a2811b4863debf312b25f4/161_88_3339_2004/master/3339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=586858868e37e53e621ad6bbbf8ae2bc","title":"manchester city v wolves premier league live","story":"An early goal and a red card for Willy Boly eased Manchester City’s progress towards a straightforward victory against WolvesThat’s all from me. I leave you with Nuno Espirito Santo’s post-match reaction. Bye! It was a tough night for us I think. Since we conceded a goal, after the game became very difficult. The red card, and all these things. The boys are working, and it becomes very hard. Playing with 11 is tough, with one man less it’s harder.Was City’s first goal disappointing?Of course. It’s a 30-yard pass that breaks us. We have to see. I think, honestly, the result there’s no doubt about it – Man City had chances, controlled the game – but we had a plan, a plan about our defensive organisation, trying to stay in the game. With the goal, with the red card, everything went down. We have to look ahead now, forget about it and look ahead.It’s a red card, no doubt about it. It’s a red card.Here’s Kyle Walker’s reaction to the win:I think when they go down to 10 men – I haven’t seen the decision – we’re always going to find it easier. Fair play to them, they gave it a good go and we were probably fortunate to get the three goals.And to his return to the first team:It was obviously disappointing when you’re left out of the Premier League line-up but it was a reality check. I had to sit on the bench, and you probably learn more than when you’re on the field. I’ve taken it under consideration, I’ve took it on the chin and I’ll just have to work hard to stay in the starting XI.And to where City are right now:I don’t think anything’s changed from the start of the season. We’re getting the rub of the green now and our luck’s starting to change. We’re still in all four competitions, we’re fighting to be in the finals of each one and we need to keep that going.Here’s a much more comprehensive match report, courtesy of Daniel Taylor:If there is one thing that Liverpool should know, squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League, it is that Manchester City have no intentions of seeing another team remove the championship trophy from their possession. Pep Guardiola’s team made that clear when Liverpool were the visitors and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions seem quite happy playing this game of catch-up. For now, at least.That was, in the end, pretty humdrum. City hogged possession but created little against an admirably organised and disciplined (one tackle excepted) Wolves side.90+4 mins: And that’s it! City win with great ease, and trim Liverpool’s lead at the top to four points!90+3 mins: City are camped on the edge of the Wolves penalty area again.90+2 mins: One last (probably) attempt on goal for City: Sterling gives the ball to Gundogan, who finds himself facing away from goal so tries backheeling it, sending it rolling gently to Rui Patricio.90+1 mins: There will be about three minutes of stoppage time, which given that there have been no injuries, penalties or red cards this half seems a bit toppish.90 mins: Traoré sets off on a lone gallop into the City half and somehow comes out of it with a corner. The away fans roar in delight.89 mins: City pass around the edge of the Wolves area for a while, without ever quite finding a way into it.86 mins: Ederson roars out of his area to intercept a Wolves through-ball, controls it, is carried forward by his momentum and ends up hanging around and playing a few passes from a position in midfield.82 mins: City are 20-1 up on shots, and 8-0 ahead when it comes to shots on target.82 mins: Danilo becomes the latest City player to send a shot from outside the box wildly high andor wide. This is perhaps the wildest of the lot, though.80 mins: A cross from the left is headed away to the edge of the area, where Fernandinho sends it arrowing towards the back of the stand.The corner is played back to De Bruyne, who hangs in a lovely cross from the left, which hits the back of Coady’s leg and goes in at the far post!77 mins: De Bruyne blasts a shot towards the near post from the edge of the area, and Rui Patricio does well to push it away for a corner.76 mins: The evening’s final substitution sees Gabriel Jesus leave the field, and Sergio Agüero come on for those few minutes’ action Pep Guardiola promised pre-match.74 mins: Back to the KompanyBoly debate, then. “I think the difference is home advantage,” writes Kári Tulinius. “As mentioned on a recent Football Weekly, there’s ample evidence that home advantage comes down to referees being influenced by the reactions of the crowd. Kompany’s tackle was at home, Boly’s away.”74 mins: City make their second change, bringing Ilkay Gundogan on and Sané off.72 mins: Wolves use up their final substitution by bringing Moutinho off, and Morgan Gibbs-White on.70 mins: Fernandinho’s shot is deflected over the bar.67 mins: Wolves are defending well, and City attacking smartly. This game has plenty to commend it, but at present is entirely lacking in drama.66 mins: De Bruyne runs onto a loose ball on the edge of the Wolves area, and blasts a shot wildly wide and high. Which is just as well, because that would have destroyed any goal it flew into.64 mins: De Bruyne sends Sterling clear with a very fine pass, but the cross is cleared. 61 mins: David Silva, as of tonight City’s all-time highest Premier League appearance maker, comes off, and Kevin de Bruyne replaces him.60 mins: Fernandinho lifts the ball over the Wolves defence, but Sané can’t quite bring it under control.58 mins: Wolves make a second change, bringing Jota off and replacing him with Romain Saïss.58 mins: Wolves are having a good spell of possession, though it’s almost entirely inside their own half.55 mins: Walker fires in a shot from range, which gets a slight deflection that helps it into Rui Patricio’s arms.54 mins: Jesus passes to Sané, who is clean through but just offside, and anyway shoots into Rui Patricio.53 mins: Wolves break through Traoré, but there’s nobody there to meet his pull-back. City then break through Sterling, but he passes into a defender’s leg. Wolves then try to break again, but a long pass to Jota runs out of play. 51 mins: City work the ball down the right with a lovely exchange of passes, and Bernardo Silva picks out Sané with the pull-back, but his shot is hilariously awful, and the ball bobbles out for a goal kick.46 mins: The second half is under way! Wolves have brought Adama Traoré on, and taken Raul Jiménez off.“The difference, for clarification, is that one of the fouls was performed by Pep’s anointed princelings while the other (totally different situation) was performed against them,” writes Matthew Turner. “No brainer, really.” That is an extremely cynical reading of the situation, if understandable in the circumstances. I think two referees can see two very similar situations very slightly differently without (necessarily) being guilty of favouritism.45+4 mins: We have had half of the time. City have one hand on three points.45+1 mins: There will be three minutes’ stoppage time, which given that there’s been a red card, a penalty and an injury seems on the light side.44 mins: Sterling somehow wins a header, in the middle of the six-yard box, but he erts the ball straight to Rui Patricio.43 mins: “Please explain, what was the difference (apart from the red card) between Bony’s tackle today and last week’s tackle from Vincent Kompany,” wonders Tim MacGabhann (and a few others). “If one’s red both are reds.” They were very similar offences, and there doesn’t seem any logical explanation for only one of them being punished with a red card. Boly could have been booked, I thought, though having said that you couldn’t really argue with the referee’s harsher interpretation.Jesus sends Rui Patricio the wrong way, and City double their lead!39 mins: Bernardo turns the ball towards Sterling in the area. He speeds past Bennett, who sticks out a leg with the ball nowhere near and catches the player!37 mins: And nearly a second at the other end! Sterling pulls back to Jesus, in a pocket of penalty-area space, but his decision to control the ball before shooting gave a defender time to get in the way of the shot when it came.36 mins: Chance for Wolves! Suddenly they have three people running towards two defenders, but Jonny tries to pass when he might have shot, and Jota didn’t anticipate it.35 mins: Sané’s very fine, mazy dribble into the box ends with his shot being blocked and bouncing away for a corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Experts explain what works and what doesn’tIf you have upped your training routine, returned to exercise after some time off or given a new activity a go, the chances are you have felt the characteristic ache of delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms). Usually kicking in around 24 to 48 hours after exercise, muscles feel tender and sore as a result of microscopic damage to the muscle fibres, which occurs when you force your muscles to work harder than they are used to, or use muscle groups that you don’t often reach in your regular workout. It can leave you feeling achy and stiff, with a walk around the office taking on a John Wayne feel.Any exercise to which you’re unaccustomed can result in a bout of Doms, says Dr Mark Wotherspoon, a consultant in sport, exercise and musculoskeletal medicine. Simply put, he says, it suggests you are “doing too much too soon”.Any changes should be gradual to allow muscles to adapt. “If you don’t get rid of that tightness and allow the muscle fibres to repair, you are more susceptible to injury for a period afterwards.”In the days following the onset of Doms, Anderson says, “don’t hammer the same muscle group again”. Instead, he suggests using other muscle groups for a few days at the gym or, if you’re a runner, simply lessening the intensity. He also suggests incorporating a progressive warm-up, in which movements become gradually more intense, and not to skimp on the warm down. Good quality sleep also plays a factor, when it comes to recovery.Although you will want to go easy on tender muscles, Wotherspoon doesn’t recommend completely abandoning your fitness routine. Instead, he advises incorporating light exercises. “If I ran on Monday and then on Tuesday was sore, I might go for a light bike ride or a little jog on Wednesday,” he says “So, exercising through it isn’t a bad thing, but exercising and ignoring it, and exercising hard, probably is not the best thing.”Do avoid any hard workouts and the temptation to “push through it” when muscles are vulnerable, he says. “Your muscle capability is reduced, your muscle power is reduced and your muscles are tender.”While nutrition can’t prevent Doms as “a natural part of the training adaptation process”, it may help reduce the effects, says sports dietitian and ultrarunner Alexandra Cook. “Most nutritional interventions to reduce Doms are closely related to inflammatory response and aiding the rebuilding of damaged muscles.”She recommends a portion of protein – the main nutrient needed for muscular repair – at each meal as well as snacks to support the recovery and muscle adaptation process. “Regular intake of carbohydrate is vital to replace muscle glycogen depleted during exercise. If you skimp on the carbohydrate, you run the risk of excessive protein (muscle) breakdown, which won’t contribute positively to the training process.”Ted Munson, a performance nutritionist at Science in Sport, agrees that carbohydrate intake is key, although the amount to consume “depends on what you’re doing. If you’re undertaking high-intensity, prolonged-duration exercise like a half-marathon, you may need to consume 8-10g of carbs per kg of body mass per day. For shorter-duration, lower-intensity exercise, the demand may be reduced.”Both Munson and Cook agree that eating something as soon as you can post-exercise is beneficial, with muscles primed to take on nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing exercise. Cook advises a simple carbohydrate and protein-based snack, while Munson suggests preparing a shake in advance both recommend following this with a balanced meal within the next hour.Water is, as usual, key, says Cook. Because muscles are made up of a high percentage of water, “even mild dehydration can make your Doms worse”. But although staying hydrated may reduce symptoms, it won’t speed up repair from muscle damage.Besides nutrition, elite athletes and novices alike swear by a number of recovery techniques, such as wearing compression clothing, using a foam roller and taking ice baths (who remembers the image of Andy Murray in an ice bath, clutching his Wimbledon trophy?) – but their effectiveness is debatable.Anderson is a fan of compression clothing and massage, but advises caution when it comes to foam rollers, which he believes can be “massively overvalued by people ... It’s a very personal thing: some people get on with it very well, some people don’t, some people do too much of it and actually cause more bruising through the foam rolling than they would have caused through the exercise.”Wotherspoon – currently lead medical officer at Southampton FC, and a medical officer for the England cricket team for more than a decade – says that, while compression stockings, ice baths, light exercises and sports massage play a part in the recovery programmes of elite athletes, it may be all in the mind.“There’s some evidence that it doesn’t matter which one of them you use, because the most effective recovery component is psychological,” he explains. “So, in other words, whatever makes you feel better, do.

Sturgeon’s spokesman responded to the claims in an official statement: “This appears to be an attempt to smear the first minister. Suggestions by Mr Salmond’s ‘insiders’ that the first minister knew about the investigation before 2 April are not true. The suggestion put to Ms Sturgeon’s chief of staff by the Times, that she knew of complaints when she met someone who could be described as an intermediary for Alex Salmond on 6 March, is also not true.”Opposition parties are to discuss on Tuesday whether to hold an independent Holyrood inquiry into the entire controversy, which could be launched after the independent commission on the ministerial code has issued its findings.Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament and reporters last week she first learned that Leslie Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant, had launched the investigationfrom Salmond in person when they met in secret at her home on 2 April.Sturgeon is under fire for failing to alert the civil service to that meeting and a subsequent phone call with Salmond on 23 April until two months after the meeting and also for allowing herself to be lobbied by him five times.The first minister told reporters on Thursday she had not been told in advance about the subject of that meeting. Her spokesman then told reporters that Lloyd was not aware of it, either.Salmond retaliated against the smear accusations on Monday by releasing an official statement which repeated his allegations against Lloyd, claiming she initiated the contacts which led to the 2 April meeting.“In the interests of accuracy it is the case that the first minister’s senior special adviser knew of the existence of complaints against Alex some time before the meeting of 2 April and that she initiated the first contact through an intermediary,” the statement said. “They then arranged the meeting which Alex asked for. Alex has no certainty as to the state of knowledge of the first minister before then.”Salmond’s press release then referred to the possibility that Sturgeon may have broken the ministerial code.If Salmond’s claims about Lloyd’s intervention are accurate, it remains unclear whether she was referring to the two cases under investigation by Evans.Salmond robustly denies any wrongdoing, but it has been reported that a parallel police investigation into those two complaints has been expanded to include other alleged incidents.The latest developments mark a new low in the relationship between Sturgeon and Salmond, once her close friend and mentor. They have not spoken in nearly six months.The row also deepens a growing rift within the Scottish National party, which hoped to capitalise on the UK government’s disarray over Brexit this week by building up the case for a second Scottish independence referendum. Senior SNP figures say privately that the strategy has been comprehensively undermined by the feud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09593d65b6fabbf7fcc70660e175e7641faa089/125_0_1546_927/master/1546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35706e31d949ba385abbccaf62da392e","title":"despairing may treads water before the main event","story":"On eve of Commons vote, PM offers a phoned-in repetition of all her other Brexit statementsNaught’s had, all’s spent. Theresa May tried. She really tried. But she just couldn’t manage it. The toxic mix of Brexit and her own stubborn incompetence has corroded the prime minister from the inside, and now she’s little more than a fragile shell. Unable to do much more than mechanically go through the motions in pursuit of a vote that she knows to be unwinnable. Sartre would have killed to know such existential despair.The Conservatives also recognise the game is up and that their leader’s authority is little more than an illusion. For May’s last-ditch effort to persuade the unpersuadable with a statement to the Commons, there were huge gaps on the government benches. Partly because few Tory MPs had anything to gain from putting themselves through such a numbing experience, but mostly to save themselves from having to witness a prime minister’s suffering. It was that painful to watch.Glassy-eyed and shrunken, May retreated into her familiar safe place. A hurried, disengaged monotone. A phoned-in repetition of every other Brexit statement she had given over the past few months. She didn’t believe a word of what she was saying, but she was nothing if not dutiful. She had some letters from the EU. Letters that were elegantly written and contained no spelling mistakes, but sadly lacked anything legally binding on the Northern Ireland backstop.After admitting that she had basically wasted the past five weeks by delaying the vote, the prime minister went on to make an unusual pitch. Remainer MPs should vote for her deal because if they didn’t then they would increase the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, and leavers should vote for her deal because a failure to do so would increase the likelihood of no Brexit at all. Even a dodgy 1980s Amstrad computer would have detected that contradiction in its algorithms.May left her greatest misjudgment to the end, by reminding MPs that history would judge them. This from a government that had mishandled the Brexit negotiations from the off, had awarded a ferry contract to a company with no ferries, whose defence secretary wants to paintball the Spanish and whose international trade secretary believes that a no-deal Brexit wouldn’t be as bad as Dunkirk. Great. At least we won’t be e-bombed by Stukas on the beach. History certainly will judge this government and the verdict won’t be kind.In a parallel universe, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May might have been an ideal match on a blind date. Both have a flair for the mediocre and instinctively misjudge the mood of the house. The Labour leader said all the right things in reply – the deal she was offering was exactly the same as the one the house would have rejected in December, etc – but he did so with little grace. This was a time for calm, measured, statesmanlike Jeremy. Not shouty, snarky Jeremy. For someone who is hoping to engineer a general election, he made little effort to engage those voters he needs to win over to become prime minister.As so often, the two leaders set the tone for what followed. Even normally passionate speakers such as Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Ed Miliband sounded as if they were overwhelmed with the semi-detached ennui of déjà vu. Everything that needed to be said had been said months ago. Along with a lot that hadn’t needed to be said and had been said anyway. Step forward Owen Paterson, who yet again insisted that the Northern Ireland border could be solved by imaginary technology operated by badgers.Several MPs from both sides of the house pressed May on whether she would extend article 50. Naturally, she prevaricated, because that’s what she always does. It’s her default mode. It’s one of the reasons the country is so screwed. Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville-Roberts injected some edge into the debate by observing that May hadn’t been so insistent on respecting the will of the people when the Welsh voted in favour of having their own national assembly, but the moment quickly passed. The time for home truths was long over.Then we were back to treading water. Monday was just a sideshow, with Tuesday’s vote the main event. Only then would we begin to see if the government did have a Plan B, or whether the only contingency was to repeat Plan A and hope for a different result. A plan that in the real world might be called the definition of insanity, but in the fantasy world of Westminster is increasingly viewed as a viable option. Brexit is making fools of everyone. Especially those who were already fools in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6464045f45ce3b167f7052fa3926323e74b44f0/0_311_6403_3842/master/6403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cac2e0009a5da5dcedabe2c6ee61401","title":"i dont trust the government to look after me or my dog meet the brexit stockpilers","story":"Some people are stockpiling food, medicine and even pet treats in anticipation of mass shortages after a no-deal Brexit. Are they overreacting, or should we be following their example?Jo Elgarf doesn’t look like you would imagine a prepper to look. She’s not a libertarian, camouflaged and armed to the eyeballs, crawling around the woods in Montana, skinning a squirrel for breakfast and fuelling up for the apocalypse. She lives with her husband and three young children in a sleepy suburb of south-west London.The stockpiling is not too extreme in Elgarf’s case it just means the kitchen cupboards are stuffed full of pasta, sauces, rice, tins, milk powder and washing powder. There are a few things she wouldn’t normally get – such as tinned vegetables – which can go to a food bank if they’re not needed. Otherwise, it’s just a bit more of the usual. Elgarf reckons they have got enough to last the family from a month to six weeks.The group is not about scaremongering, she says. Quite the opposite – it’s about calming like-minded people down, and about promoting an old-fashioned larder mentality. “Have a look in your cupboard if you got snowed in for a month, could you cope? We’re not predicting you won’t get anything. What we’re saying is: you may walk into a shop and can’t find any rice. Have you got something at home to replace it?Because it’s not just about food for Elgarf and her family. One of her four-year-old twins, Nora, who has been sitting happily on her mum’s lap as we talk, has a rare brain condition called polymicrogyria. She has lots of prescriptions, but without two of them – Epilim and Keppra – for her epilepsy, she would have multiple seizures a day. “She can’t do without them,” says Elgarf. Both Epilim and Keppra are imported.If she could stockpile these medicines, she would. But they are controlled, and she can only get a month’s supply at a time. “It should be all right,” she has been told by doctors and the pharmacists. But when it’s your daughter’s life that’s at stake, “it should be all right” isn’t good enough.Many of the people who join the Facebook group have concerns about medicines, Elgarf says. There are a lot of diabetics and coeliacs among them. What they need is some reassurance. “We need to know for certain they have got a proper plan in place for anybody who depends on meds.” She has heard rumours that the most critical medicines may have to be collected from central hubs, which would be stocked on the basis of lists provided by GPs. It’s clearly something she has given thought to.Elgarf is also clear about why she is talking to me. “So come April and there’s no Epilim in the country, I’ll say: ‘Where’s that  man?’ And you guys are going to be interested because this little child you saw in January now has no meds.” Nora has fallen asleep on her mum.And so to another unlikely prepper, and member of the same group, in Cardiff. “I don’t identify as a prepper, but I am prepping,” says Helena, who doesn’t want her surname published. “I always thought preppers were a bit batshit crazy and am quite surprised to find myself in this position.”Helena, who has a politics degree and works for a charity, doesn’t come across as crazy. None of the people I speak to do. Informed: tick. Cautious: tick. Organised: tick. Very organised, in Helena’s case: she has – and shares with me – a spreadsheet, colour-coded according to what is fully purchased (eg tinned tomatoes and loo paper, alongside a note that the average person uses 110 rolls a year), part-purchased (eg cereal), waiting delivery (powdered coconut), or pending testing (dried falafel mix). Falafel! I’m going straight round to Helena’s. She also has booze and biscuits. Brexit party in Cardiff on Friday 29 March, everyone. And she’s got makeup! We’re going to be looking good as the good ship Britannia goes down.Helena is not just prepping for herself. She is doing it for her dog, Charlie, too. And while she has about three months’ worth of supplies for herself, she is looking at more like a year for the dog, as she doesn’t see that pet food will be a priority. “I don’t really trust the government to look after me I certainly don’t trust them to look after my dog,” she says. As well as dog food, there are treats and toys on the spreadsheet. Charlie is going to enjoy a hard Brexit.Helena sees it as an insurance policy. “Unless there’s enormous panic buying, I don’t think there’s going to be nothing on the shelves at Asda,” she says. “But I do think there’s a very good chance that choice is going to be limited.”Helena’s dad agrees. He thinks he should be doing the same, but just hasn’t got round to it yet. Her mum – who is “nearly as keen on Brexit as Nigel Farage” – has accused her of gullibility, ignorance and spreading fear. “I don’t think it’s scaremongering to protect your family, and because people are doing this earlier it means that, when we get to 29 March, there’s going to be more left for people who haven’t prepped, and the supply chains will have had the chance to catch up.”She hopes she is being overcautious. “I don’t want to be proved right at all. I’d be super-happy if, a year from now, I’m sitting here thinking: ‘Bloody hell, I’ve still got tinned potatoes on the shelf.’ I hope that my mother is right and Brexit is a fantastic success … the land of milk and honey.”As opposed to the land of powdered milk and … “golden syrup”, she says. Actually, there’s honey and golden syrup on the spreadsheet.In Cambridge, Diane says she is also stockpiling, though she doesn’t want to go into too much detail. “I’m a bit cautious about being presented as an idiot who has a cupboard full of stuff,” she says. She’s OK about using her surname, though: she is Diane Coyle, OBE, FACSS, the economist, Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, former adviser to the Treasury, vice-chair of the BBC Trust, member of the Competition Commission, winner of the Indigo prize … in short, really not an idiot.“The point about supply chains,” she explains, “is that the things you buy in the supermarket today were on the road last night. Supermarkets now don’t have warehouses full of stuff. If we have a no deal and the delays go up even by 12 hours – although I see there’s a new report saying it is going to be much more – then things will stop being put on the shelves. They will run out. And it’s not just stuff we buy from the EU, and it’s not just fresh produce – it’s quite a lot of things.”Coyle knows that she can’t get by without a cuppa and doesn’t want to run out of teabags or coffee because she didn’t get any in before a no-deal exit. “It’s things that matter to me, that we import, and it’s a bit of insurance.”She did the same with cash before the financial crisis. Lending rates were going off the scale “The message was the banks don’t trust each other with their money overnight, so why should I trust them with money overnight?” She took out some cash and stashed it away just in case in the end she didn’t need it, but it emerged later that the cash machines were close to stopping working.Coyle worries that a lot of people don’t get the point about supply chains and the modern economy. “And, of course, it’s not just things we buy in supermarkets – it’s all the things companies use in making stuff, all of those imported components they use. It’s a just-in-time economy. This is a source of a lot of efficiency gains and improvements in productivity ever since the 1980s, and it means that people don’t hold stocks of stuff any more. So you’re very vulnerable to delays in imports getting into the country.”Surely the government realises this? “Well, I’m sure the civil servants appreciate it, and I’m sure some of the ministers appreciate it, but I don’t think all of them do, at least not from what they’re saying in public.”In north Cornwall, Nevine Mann believes we will leave the EU without a deal, and that’s what she is preparing for. “We’re expecting it to be pretty horrendous for at least a couple of months, hopefully settling down and becoming less horrendous over time,” says the former midwife. “Long term, we expect what’s available to be more expensive and different.”She and her family (five in total) are as ready as anyone. “We’ve done it early and slowly, so it’s not making a major impact on what’s available for others. We’re pretty much done. I’ve got a very short list of items I want to add.”They have supplies to last from four to six months, stored under the stairs, in the loft and the garage. Food, for them and for the cat (“The cat is fussy enough to starve herself if she doesn’t get what she wants”), and paracetamol and ibuprofen for kids and adults. And vitamin tablets in case there’s a shortage of vegetables.Mann has also been trying to stockpile a prescription antihistamine her younger son takes for his allergy to grass pollen. “I’ve always had my prescriptions once every two months rather than monthly anyway, so what I’m doing is just ordering them early and gradually building up a supply.”So far, they have only got a few weeks’ worth. It’s less of a worry than Nora’s Epilim and Keppra, perhaps, but concerning nonetheless: without it, he can’t go outdoors between March and October.For the Manns, it’s not just about stockpiling food and a bit of medicine. They are probably the best prepped of the preppers I speak to. They were planning to put solar panels on the roof anyway, but with the threat of no deal they have done it sooner, and they are trying to set up a system that stores energy on a big battery. They have a 1,100-litre water collection tank in the garden. And they’re hoping not to be needing those vitamin tablets because they will have their own fresh veg. They’re no experts (“Actually, I have a bit of a reputation for killing everything,” says Mann), but they have got vegetable patches in the garden, and they’re giving it a go, trying to grow overwintering varieties from seed.The results are mixed so far. Slugs and snails have had most of the purple sprouting broccoli, the winter lettuce and the chard, but the Manns have been more successful with broad beans, mangetout, shallots and garlic. I’m thinking the garlic may go with the snails, with a mangetout side … but maybe that’s one for further down the line.Mann and family also have some mature fruit trees and bushes, and are trying to learn what to do with them. They’re picking the brains of greener-fingered friends, they have bought a couple of idiots’ guides, they’re hoping they may have a little extra. “We’re planning, actually, to create a few little Brexit boxes for friends and family, who we know can’t manage to prepare for themselves, so they’ve got something at least,” says Mann.Brexit boxes! Isn’t that lovely? Who says it’s all about hatred, ision and polarisation? And could this be the beginning of what may, one day, be known as Brexit spirit?Lastly, and briefly, to Dollis Hill, a sleepy suburb of north-west London. Vicky, a nosy teacher, picks from the printer a draft of her boyfriend Sam’s article about stockpiling for Brexit. It’s all so bloody stupid, she says, and she means that it’s come to this – a wartime mentality in what’s supposed to be peacetime, not that people are stockpiling. “I’m going to do a bit,” she announces. “But where shall we put it? And we’re definitely having dried falafel mix.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239c90907952554c566ed640e604744b09ec7450/1333_1300_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3045ea56b7f804aa65c2d5baaf2e5302","title":"i wont ever vote again stoke bemoans brexit bickering","story":"Two-and-a-half years after referendum, there is little sign of sentiment changing in UK’s ‘Brexit capital’As Theresa May swept on to a factory floor on the edge of Stoke, Patricia Clewlow admonished herself for what she was about to say. “I’ve voted every year since I was 18 because it’s right that I should,” said the 79-year-old. “Particularly for the brave women that won us the vote. But I honestly feel that if this goes by the board, I shan’t ever vote again. It’s naughty to feel like that but that’s how I feel.”“I don’t understand all the mess,” she said outside the city’s library on Monday morning. “I just can’t understand what the problem is. Why’s it taken so long to sort out? It’s what the majority of people voted for. Would there have been all this to-do if the remainers had won?”With 74 days until Britain leaves the EU, there is little sign of sentiment changing in the city dubbed the Brexit capital of Britain. It was a label coined by Paul Nuttall, the former Ukip leader, during an ill-fated attempt to win the Stoke-on-Trent byelection in 2017.As May spoke to a room of journalists and about 100 Portmeirion pottery workers, Tony Walley, 54, a supermarket worker, said he felt powerless to influence any of the decisions made in Westminster. He chose not to vote in the EU referendum, which he felt was pushed by “Hooray Henrys in London” who were “the first to drop it”.“I think it took them by surprise and if there was another vote it would fail. They seem to be making a right hash of it,” he said.Opening up his family-run carpet store near Stoke minster, Adam Norris doubted whether leaving the EU would affect places like Stoke. He voted to leave, backs May’s deal, but feels it will make little difference.“Nothing really changes apart from shops closing down,” said the 63-year-old, whose family business, Norris Carpets, has been fixture of the cities since 1985. “In the market it’s gone terrible for them. It’s gone very quiet.”Perhaps the most contentious issue. In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, a backstop arrangement that keeps the UK in the customs union and requires Northern Ireland to follow single market rules would prevail until a free-trade agreement is reached that avoids such a frontier.The UK and EU negotiators have agreed the former should honour those commitments it made while a member of the bloc – finally settling on a figure of £39bn.The deal would secure a status quo transition period to negotiate the nature of the future relationship, and during which the UK could begin to make trade deals with third countries.A fraught issue at the outset, an agreement was reached relatively quickly that would see the UK respect the rights of EU citizens who arrive before the end of the transition period, which could be in 2022, and vice versa.The document is accompanied by a political declaration that sketches out the future relationship between the two parties – focusing primarily on trade and security.“At last!” declared the front page of Monday’s Sentinel, above the news that 200 homes have been promised on the site where the city’s ceramics giant Royal Doulton closed its headquarters 15 years ago, with the loss of 525 jobs. “It was a hammer blow for the town and one from which it has never recovered,” the paper reported.Unemployment in Stoke is higher than average, and the average property price is £105,000, compared with £230,000 in the rest of the UK.“There’s no jobs about hardly,” complained Adele Smith, 42, outside a busy Stoke cafe. “I voted to stay in so there would be more jobs.” Asked what she would tell the prime minister, Smith said: “I’d tell her bugger off. She’s no bloody use.”Waiting for a bus near Stoke’s indoor market, which opens three days a week, an 84-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, said she had voted for remain but accepted that she was on the losing side. “To me, it’s out and get on with it,” she said.While MPs were “bickering” about the EU, she said, high streets in places like Stoke were being decimated by closures. “Look around this place. Look at how it’s run down,” she said, gesturing to a street dotted with bookmakers, charity shops and empty shopfronts. “What’s going to happen when all these shops close down? Where’s everyone going to shop? We’re worse now than in the war.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09593d65b6fabbf7fcc70660e175e7641faa089/52_17_1518_911/master/1518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d6056bce0e31085585e65392af9980","title":"may makes final case for brexit deal dont let the people down","story":"Prime minister urges MPs to give her plan a second look on eve of crunch vote on withdrawal agreementTheresa May appears to be on course for a crushing defeat in the House of Commons as Britain’s bitterly ided MPs prepare to give their verdict on her Brexit deal in the “meaningful vote” on Tuesday.With Downing Street all but resigned to losing by a significant margin,  analysis pointed to a majority of more than 200 MPs against the prime minister.Labour sources said that unless May made major unexpected concessions, any substantial margin against her would lead Jeremy Corbyn to call for a vote of no confidence in the government – perhaps as soon as Tuesday night. But since Conservative MPs are unlikely to offer Corbyn the backing he would need to win a no-confidence vote, he would then come under intense pressure to swing Labour’s weight behind a second referendum.Cabinet ministers have not yet been told how May plans to keep the Brexit process on track if her deal is defeated – and they remain split on how she should proceed. Leavers are convinced that the prime minister should return to Brussels and press for fresh concessions, while remainers hope she will seek a compromise with Labour.On Monday, May issued one final call to parliament to back her, urging MPs to “take a second look” at her deal and stressing that it was the only option on the table that could deliver an “orderly” exit from the EU.But there was little evidence of movement after her speech. Few MPs were convinced by clarifications of the withdrawal agreement included in an exchange of letters between the prime minister and the EU council president, Jean-Claude Juncker, published on Monday, which May conceded did not go as far as some MPs had hoped.With defeat for May all but inevitable, backbenchers led by the former Tory minister Nick Boles were hoping to seize the agenda in parliament and force the government to seek a softer, Norway-style Brexit deal.And on Monday the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, was forced to bat away questions from loyal Tory MPs suggesting he was willing to facilitate a backbench takeover. “I have no intention of taking lectures in doing right by parliament from people who have been conspicuous in denial of and, sometimes, contempt for it,” he said. “I will stand up for the rights of the Commons and I won’t be pushed around by agents of the executive.” Perhaps the most contentious issue.

The prime minister refused to rule out doing so categorically on Monday, saying only that she didn’t believe it should be necessary.“We’re leaving on 29 March. I’ve been clear I don’t believe we should be extending article 50 and I don’t believe we should be having a second referendum,” May said. “We have an instruction from the British people to leave and it’s our duty to deliver on that, but I want to do it in a way that is smooth and orderly and protects jobs and security.”There are increasing fears in Whitehall that time is running out to put in place all the complex legislation necessary either to implement the withdrawal agreement – or, conversely, to prepare for no deal.11.30am The Commons begins sitting. The first item is questions to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and his ministerial team. These are meant to last 30 minutes but can run slightly over.

However, before the crucial vote, MPs must vote on some of the dozen or so amendments tabled by Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP as well as backbenchers including Labour’s Hilary Benn and the Tory MP Andrew Murrison. It remains unclear how many of these will be put to a ision. One amendment, tabled by the Tory Hugo Swire, has been accepted by the government.At some point between around 7.30pm to 9.30pm\u0026nbspMPs finally vote on the deal, as amended.May addressed MPs of her own party on Monday night at the backbench 1922 Committee. The prime minister gave no indication of any plan B in what was described as a low-key, reflective meeting, but urged her party to support her deal to ensure that Brexit goes ahead and to keep Corbyn out of No 10.Nadhim Zahawi, a junior minister, said that Alistair Burt, a Foreign Office minister and remainer, had told MPs that he now accepted the result of the referendum and urged Brexiters in his party, who were on the winning side, to do the same.Brexiters leaving the meeting said their minds had not been changed. Steve Baker said: “She skilfully engineered her speech to ensure there were laughs in all the right places by not mentioning the deal.”Just four Labour MPs have declared publicly that they could vote for May’s Brexit deal: Ian Austin, John Mann, Jim Fitzpatrick and Kevin Barron.Corbyn urged his MPs to hold their nerve, addressing a packed meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on the eve of the vote. The Labour leader said the prime minister had comprehensively failed to scare his MPs into voting for her deal. “Theresa May has attempted to blackmail Labour MPs to vote for her botched deal by threatening the country with the chaos of no deal,” he said. “I know from conversations with colleagues that this has failed. The Labour party will not be held to ransom.”Corbyn said May would “only have herself to blame” for two years of negotiating with her ided cabinet and backbenchers, rather than opening dialogue with Brussels, trade unions, businesses and parliament. “The Tory party’s botched deal will be rejected by Parliament. We will then need an election to have the chance to vote for a government that can bring our people together and address the deep-seated issues facing our country,” he said.A Labour source said MPs “won’t have to wait very long” for a confidence vote to be called but that would be the sole decision of Corbyn rather than the shadow cabinet. “Jeremy will choose the moment,” the source said. However, the source said that should the vote be lost, it would not mean an immediate endorsement to campaign for a second referendum.“The composite identifies a public vote as one of the options it doesn’t say it’s the preferred option or the default option. Obviously we will judge how to deal with the options and get the best result for the country on the basis of what happens in parliament,” the source said.The Brexit select committee chair, Hilary Benn, was under pressure on Monday night to withdraw a no-deal amendment, tabled before Christmas, that some MPs feared could limit the scale of the government’s defeat.Downing Street declined to say whether it could support an amendment tabled by the backbencher Andrew Murrison, chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, aimed at putting a formal end date on the Irish backstop. Such a sunset clause would be likely to run into trouble in Brussels, with the EU27 adamant that the backstop must apply “unless and until” an alternative arrangement is in place that avoids the need for a hard border.But the amendment’s supporters believe it will strengthen the PM’s hand if she returns to Brussels in search of fresh concessions after Tuesday. They also hope that if it passes, it could help limit the scale of the government defeat.Governments have been defeated by a margin of more than 100 votes only three times in the last century, according to professor Philip Cowley, of Queen Mary’s University – all of those during the minority Labour administration of 1924.The House of Lords had its own vote on the government’s Brexit deal on Monday evening, rejecting it by a thumping 321 votes to 152 – a majority of 169. Labour’s leader in the Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, called it “a vote for common sense”.

Dawson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether he is subsidising its activities himself, whether he is relying on public donations, or whether there is another financial backer.He is the only public inidual associated with the group, which has spent £88,000 on pro-Brexit adverts in the last three months.Many of the adverts placed by Britain’s Future use localised targeting to a greater degree than Vote Leave did in the 2016 EU referendum campaign and are designed to encourage members of the public to send messages to politicians who are making up their mind on which side to back in Tuesday’s crunch Brexit vote in the House of Commons.Facebook introduced new rules on political advertising transparency at the end of last year after a series of scandals associated with the 2016 US presidential election and the EU referendum. They require all political advertising to be labelled, to be placed in a public archive for seven years, and for those placing the adverts to verify they are living at a UK postal address.However, the new rules do not force an advertiser to declare the ultimate source of the money for any political campaigns, meaning it is simple to place adverts with minimal transparency on who is ultimately picking up the tab.Facebook’s Richard Allan said the company had taken “an industry-leading position” on ad transparency, going beyond what was required by law. “This includes a ‘paid for by’ disclaimer that requires an advertiser to accurately represent who is running that ad, and our ad library that archives political ads for seven years. We also publish a weekly report detailing ads run and top spenders across our platforms. This information gives everyone the ability to easily find out information about the pages running political ads and direct questions to them.”He said the company welcomed the additional scrutiny. “This is exactly why we have introduced this industry-leading solution: to bring more transparency to political ads on the platform and encourage people to ask questions.”Since the rules were introduced in October, by far the biggest political advertisers on Facebook have been anti-Brexit groups. People’s Vote has spent £220,000 pushing its message to the public, while the related campaign Best for Britain spent £150,000. The anti-Brexit groups have declared only partial accounts of their funding, although many big donors – such as the financier George Soros – have gone public with their funding.Facebook records show that the UK government has spent almost £100,000 of public money promoting Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the last three months, while the Conservatives have spent tens of thousands of pounds pushing the prime minister’s vision for leaving the EU.Facebook’s attempts to introduce background checks on political advertisers have had inadvertent side-effects for organisations that are not involved in day-to-day Westminster debate. The National Theatre found its ads for David Hare’s political play I’m Not Running were flagged for failing to include enough transparency details.

And so, on a balmy summer’s evening in Melbourne, at a venue where he has suffered more than his fair share of heartache, Andy Murray played what may yet turn out to be his last ever match with almost 15,000 fans hanging on his every move.And for long spells, belief was somehow suspended. Murray, dressed in dark blue and white, straining at every turn, matched Roberto Bautista Agut, a Spaniard ranked world No 22 in some of the best form of his life. For a few glorious hours, it was hard to tell that this might be it. “Isn’t he supposed to be injured?” one fan muttered?This, of course, was where Murray has had so much success and yet fallen agonisingly short so many times in the past. Five times he made the final, and five times there was always someone better, just. On one occasion, defeat was so raw that only a hug from Judy Murray, his mum, would help.Judy was courtside here, alongside her older son Jamie. You know it’s serious when Jamie’s there. Leon Smith, his first coach other than Judy, sat next to Nigel Sears, Murray’s father-in-law. This was a family affair, one last chance perhaps, although if he can make it to Wimbledon, then perhaps he will get the send-off he really deserves.Has there been a better competitor in British sport over the past 50 years? It’s hard to think of one. Murray has been through the lows, struggled with injury, with doubts, with fears, and come out the other side as a serial winner. He has always been popular but here in particular, they took him to their hearts right from the get-go, as the Aussies would say.Murray came on to court shortly after Kyle Edmund, the man who has replaced him as the British No 1, was sent packing in the first round. This was Murray’s stage and even if he was in pain, limping between points and clearly in discomfort, he would not give up trying. He never has.The television captioners must have had a field day. Murray has always been vocal on court but as he strained to race down the angles, he was even more vociferous. “Aaagh, ugghhhh, agghh.” Grimacing throughout, Murray continued to hit the ball as well as he had done at any time in the past year, but there was no disguising the pain he must have been in. “He’s hobbling,” one man said in the crowd, the realisation kicking in as Bautista Agut took the second set.The Spaniard was quietly doing his business, pushing Murray around the court, wrong-footing him when he could, forcing him to extremes he can no longer reach. He was clinical. It was almost cruel.And yet this was Murray, so there would be drama, moments of utter brilliance, of defiance, a reminder of the things that have made him so great. On the first point of the third set, finding himself pinned to the baseline and almost wrong-footed with Bautista Agut at the net, Murray dipped a backhand pass low. Moving forward for the expected drop volley, he almost overran the ball but stopped dead and flicked a half-volley over Bautista Agut’s head. The Spaniard tried the tweener and Murray angled away a deft volley. Fist raised, he took in the applause one more time.“Andy’s fans in the stands, if you hear us, clap your hands,” said a group of people in the crowd, a plea that drew the Scottish flags out in force. Murray was taking it all in, seemingly enjoying the whole experience and hating it at the same time.Then came the twist. Down a break in the third set, Murray hammered a backhand return to set up break-back point, and then played a perfect drop shot, followed by a backhand slice into the open court for the break for 2-2. Arms aloft, Murray pumped his fist and waved both arms around. The crowd loved it.On the second point of the following game, Murray yelled “Let’s go,” just like old times. And when he held serve to love to lead 3-2, was there a slight spring in his limp? He thought he could win, didn’t he? Suddenly he was bouncing around and so were the crowd. When he took the third set, the crowd went mad when he snatched the fourth, Murray’s roar was deafening.Queen’s We Will Rock You rang out as the fifth set began but the pain was there too, as it was on the faces of Judy and Jamie, who looked like they could barely handle it. The fight was still there, as it’s always been. The ovation he received as he served to stay in the match will live long in his memory and was met with a wave of the racket. There was nothing more he could have done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f159709a908a9315646e076c10644da6a22f3705/0_135_3035_1820/master/3035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a853ff4ab9e3b2bfbbf68a55022c38f2","title":"taulupe faletau wales six nations broken arm","story":"The Wales No 8 Taulupe Faletau looks set to miss the Six Nations after breaking his arm again, according to reports.Faletau, a British and Irish Lion, suffered a fractured forearm playing for Bath in October and missed the autumn international series.The 28-year-old returned for his club in Saturday’s 18-16 Champions Cup win over Wasps but he has reportedly suffered another break.Faletau is expected to be out for up to eight weeks, with the final round of Six Nations fixtures on 16 March.Wales begin their campaign away to France on 1 February and Warren Gatland is due to announce his squad at midday on Tuesday.Speaking after his side’s game on Saturday, the Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, had been full of praise for Faletau. “He looked great, didn’t he? Really sharp. If only we could have given him more ball,” Blackadder said. “Before the game he was really, really nervous. But it’s good to see those nerves from an experienced guy like him.”Gatland has several other injury concerns, with Leigh Halfpenny set to miss the start of the tournament as he has not played since suffering concussion during the victory over Australia on 10 November.The Scarlets head coach, Wayne Pivac, said last week that Halfpenny has seen a specialist and would not feature for three to five weeks. Saracens’ Liam Williams is likely to fill the full-back spot for the opener in Paris.Dan Biggar is also nursing a knee injury suffered in Northampton’s European Challenge Cup defeat by Clermont Auvergne.

It is further alleged that his motive for placing the order was to obtain Testogel to administer to an athlete to improve their athletic performance.” Freeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2015, has denied all doping charges in the past but this tribunal has the potential to throw a dark shadow over British cycling’s golden decade.According to the pre-hearing information, when Dr Freeman was first asked about the delivery by a fellow member of staff, he denied ordering the Testogel and said it must have been a mistake by the supplier, the Oldham-based Fit4Sport Limited. In October 2011 it is also alleged that he asked Fit4Sport for written confirmation it had been sent in error, returned and destroyed “knowing that this had not taken place”. It is claimed he showed this false email to others knowing it to be “untrue”.Freeman’s case, which will start in Manchester on 5 February and could run until 6 March, will also look into allegations that he lied about the Testogel delivery when questioned by the UK Anti-Doping Agency in 2017, when he claimed it was for a member of British Cycling’s staff and that it had been returned to the supplier.Freeman’s medical record-keeping, which was criticised by the UK Anti-Doping Agency when it looked into a separate case regarding a jiffy bag delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011, will also be investigated. Wiggins has always denied any wrongdoing.Freeman, who resigned from British Cycling 17 months ago after telling the organisation he was too ill to face disciplinary action about his record-keeping, was unavailable for comment.However, a British Cycling spokesman said: “British Cycling suspended Dr Richard Freeman in March 2017 and subsequently initiated an investigation into his conduct as an employee of the federation. British Cycling requested that Dr Freeman be interviewed as part of the investigation: however, he declined to make himself available for interview, citing grounds of ill health.“In September 2017, he resigned from British Cycling. British Cycling has raised concerns relating to Dr Freeman’s fitness to practise with the General Medical Council and has continued to support the GMC’s investigation, in which the federation is a co-referrer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eea17842fe6a9257148050dc3cf026c137f2245/0_292_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f95204b95e8dd65f506baf05db76831","title":"our lady of kibeho royal and derngate northampton rwandan genocide katori hall","story":"Katori Hall’s play Our Lady of Kibeho is the story of three friends who insisted that they were visited by the Virgin Mary and told of the horror that lay aheadThe 16-year-old schoolgirl Alphonsine Mumureke said she was in the cafeteria of the Catholic boarding school Kibeho College, Rwanda, when she heard a voice “soft as air and sweeter than music”. She saw a beautiful woman – neither white nor black – floating above the floor in a flowing seamless dress, with a veil that covered her hair. She wore no shoes, just like Alphonsine and her classmates.“Who are you?” Alphonsine asked. “I am the mother of the word,” replied the woman, whom Alphonsine immediately recognised as the Virgin Mary. Then she issued a terrible warning: Rwanda was going to become a hell on Earth in a conflict that would see the picturesque rivers of Kibeho village run red with blood.It was 28 November 1981, and when Alphonsine reported what she had seen, her friends ridiculed her, her teachers scolded her and her village shunned her. But then another two students, Anathalie and Marie Claire – the three became known as “the Trinity” – insisted they too had been visited by the Virgin Mary and given the same apocalyptic warning.Kibeho is a small parish nestled in Mubuga, the “land of the seven hills” in eastern Rwanda. It is the most famine-prone region of one of the world’s poorest countries, but so beautiful that locals say: “God comes on holiday here.”Of course we now know that, a decade after the Trinity’s terrible visions, Rwanda was riven by a terrible genocide. During 100 days in 1994, up to a million of Rwanda’s population of just over seven million were murdered by the ruling Hutu government in an attempt to exterminate the Tutsi tribe.Thousands of people were slaughtered in their churches, their decapitated bodies dumped into rivers. Colleagues, neighbours, friends and even family members slaughtered one another. Kibeho itself suffered two massacres. Thousands of citizens were brutally killed in the parish church and, a year later, on the esplanade where the apparitions had taken place. Most of the college’s students were murdered.In 2001, after a 20-year investigation by the Vatican – and seven years after the genocide – the pope certified the apparitions as authentic. Tens of thousands of pilgrims now travel to Kibeho each year in search of benediction.The extraordinary story of these three schoolgirls inspired my friend, the American playwright Katori Hall, to write Our Lady of Kibeho. I first worked with Katori in New York in 2006. Katori’s background as a journalist and an actor bring a rare sensibility to her plays, which combine a reporter’s eye for a good story and historical detail together with an understanding of how to craft characters that only an actor can experience. Back in London, I staged the world premiere of her play The Mountaintop, about the life and death of Martin Luther King, which went on to become the surprise winner of the best play award at the 2010 Oliviers and is now one of the most produced new plays in the US.For Katori, Kibeho College symbolised the defining role the Catholic church has played in Rwanda’s education system and political life over the last century, including shaping its ideological isions. It was the church that had helped implement the disastrous “racial” nationwide census, distinguishing Hutu from Tutsi in every neighbourhood.Alone in their community, Alphonsine, Anathalie and Marie Claire understood the lessons that scripture offered against the growing hatred of their times. Young and powerless, their warnings went unheeded. Survivors of the tragedy describe burning churches, streets clotted with corpses, starving livestock, mass graves, lost orphans and famine and disease everywhere – the very things described by the three girls when recounting their terrible visions.Fergal Keane, a BBC correspondent in Rwanda in 1994, found it difficult to capture the horror of what happened. “In writing about Rwanda, I am conscious that my words will always be unequal to the task … What I encountered was evil in a form that rendered me inarticulate.”Most historical accounts of the genocide focus on either society or the state, the former exploring the longstanding racism in Rwandan society and the latter documenting the complex power struggles in government and the ways in which propaganda radiated from the capital to the provinces and inspired the violence. While Katori’s play touches on the political, economic and social, it is more interested in how religion can influence the personal and political behaviour of a nation.What makes Katori’s play so moving is that it takes place at a time before the genocide, when there is still space for optimism in the lives of the schoolchildren it depicts.Some of those children who survived have helped Katori in researching her play. They have noted that the power of Our Lady of Kibeho lies in its ability to stay true to the perspectives of Alphonsine, Anathalie and Marie Claire. Despite rumblings of the growing ide between Hutus and Tutsis, we lose ourselves in this story of these three young women who want to change the world they will inherit.Whether the visions that they described were real or not, the schoolgirls’ testimony highlighted the daily injustices that they saw around them. Theirs was a protest against the moral, social and political decay of their community – a reminder that sometimes young people can sense tragedy ahead in a way that adults are incapable of.In turbulent times when the voices of young people are so often ignored, Katori and I hope that the UK premiere of this extraordinary play will spark a conversation on ways to heal our own political, racial and religious ides.On a summer morning in 2003, many of those who had participated in the genocidal killings walked out of prison into the sunshine, singing hymns, their freedom granted by the president. Survivors watched as those who had killed their families and friends returned to their villages, reoccupying homes that had been empty for almost a decade. Today, Rwandans continue to confront on a daily basis the pain of memory, the power of reconciliation, the challenges of redemption and forgiveness and the ineradicability of loss. Two words hover over the nation’s collective psychology: never again.• Our Lady of Kibeho is at the Royal and Derngate, Northampton, until 2 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fb4261b986b777c3bbd21cf2496fae6bc7ffd1/0_1674_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65dac81020f01ef53cc8ea10440d43c3","title":"10 best meditation mindfulness retreats holidays uk europe","story":"We pick mindfulness and meditation holidays in beautiful surroundings – many combined with other activities like walking, singing and tai chiMore retreat top 10s: yoga | creative | by readersIn the Dart valley near Totnes, the Sharpham Trust meditation centre offers mindfulness retreats of different lengths throughout the year, including walking and singing breaks.

One who once, along with some of her bandmates, very publicly poured a bucket of icy water over the deputy prime minister’s head. There’s even a festive wreath hanging on the front door – that’s practically bourgeois isn’t it?To be honest I’ve been doubting Alice Nutter’s continued anarcho-punk credentials since speaking to her on the phone, when she tipped me off that for an extra £20 I could upgrade to first class on the train. First class?! What, so I can attack the enemy from the inside? No, because it’s easier to get some work done …“Everyone thinks that somehow we’d be preserved in aspic, you know, like aged anarchists,” she says after letting me in. “I think everybody should have the right to first class, I don’t think some people should have it and some people shouldn’t. I think everybody should have the right to what’s good in life – I’m not embarrassed about that.”Alice Nutter offers me a latte. A FRIGGING LATTE! (He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a latte drink.) Her 19-year-old daughter, Mae, comes into the kitchen to make toast. She knows “embarrassingly little” about Chumbawamba, or Tubthumping. “I’ve always known mum as a writer,” she says. Because that’s what Alice Nutter is now. A writer of plays, and a TV screenwriter, most recently on Trust, the entertaining drama series about the kidnapping of Jean Paul Getty III.Alice always knew she was going to be a writer, ever since a teacher told her mum and dad that their daughter had an extraordinary command of the English language. But Nutter (or Anne Holden as she was before she punked herself up by deed poll, taking the name of a woman who was hanged in 1612 for witchcraft) didn’t get off to the brightest of starts. Born to a working-class family in Burnley, she had a bad relationship with her dad, got involved with drugs and left school with only a couple of O levels. Fortunately, she started hanging around with a more aspirational group of kids and that basically saved her. Together they became Chumbawamba. (I get knocked down, but I get up again.)Alice, now 57, was with the band for 22 of their 30 years in existence, singing, playing percussion, jumping around. “I’m not particularly musical,” she admits. “I’m a good dancer and I’m theatrical, I could get away with it.”For 20 years they lived in a squat in Leeds, sharing (very little) money, and ideas, becoming vegans (long before everyone became a vegan), getting involved with political causes – South Africa, Northern Ireland, the miners’ strike. More than anything, they were friends. Still are.Were they anarchists? “I don’t think it matters what you call yourself. What you need to do is align yourself with what’s most useful for change.” She says inequality was their main beef: “You can bring everything down to inequality and injustice. And it can be about class, or race, or whatever. At the time we were really anti-parliamentary because we thought they were all the same.”These days Alice knocks on doors for the Labour party, for Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. “Promoting co-ops and cooperation, saying they’ll pledge £100m a year to help the homeless, I’ll knock on doors for that,” she says. “I was lucky, I came up through the postwar settlement, I screwed my education up, but I had those opportunities.”She feels that working-class kids today don’t have the chances she had. “I’d never be where I am today without the dole. That paid for me to have a creative life.”She describes herself as “a sort of communist-Marxist. Not a party political Communist, but in the sense of all things in common for people and the idea of sharing. I know I’ve got a lot but I’m totally willing to have less.” There’s a bust of Karl Marx on the mantelpiece, along with one of James Dean. We’ve moved into the cosy living room, with a wood-burner, a Christmas tree and biscuits.Chumbawamba’s big hit, Tubthumping, an anthem of defiance for the ordinary and the oppressed, came out in 1997. It didn’t win anything at the Brit awards ceremony, but that was where John Prescott got his soaking. Chumbawamba were angry about the government’s failure to resolve the Liverpool dockers’ strike. (They were not fans of New Labour or Blair.) They were also drunk, and disappointed – not so much about their own failure to win but about the fact that winning would have given a platform to the sacked scouse docker they’d brought along.Tubthumping also, for the first time, provided Chumbawamba with a bit of money. Ironic perhaps, but equally shared. Alice left the band in 2004, because “if you’re jumping about in your mid-40s, you look fucking stupid”. And because she knew she wasn’t really a musician, she was a writer. “I’d been planning it, in my head, all my life.”At the age of 28, while in Chumbawamba, Alice took an English A level. Plus she’d written short stories, a play for a Bradford anarchist group, and – with the band – a pantomime for the kids of striking miners in south Wales. “We didn’t know owt about theatre, we were making it up as we went along. We’d heard of Brecht, didn’t know fucking anything about it. I’d only been to the theatre twice before I started writing for it. I saw Hamlet and I thought, I can do that.”It wasn’t as easy as that. She soon realised that though she might have the right muscles she didn’t have the craft, and sitting at home trying wasn’t working. There needed to be a plan, focus. It was going to take time and a lot of graft. She started a screenwriting MA but quit when she began to feel it was more about getting a qualification than learning to write.Then she got on a so-you-want-to-be-a-writer course at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which meant cancelling a holiday. That led to the offer of a three-week run in the Playhouse courtyard of her play Foxes, about a group of asylum seekers in Leeds. “I had a budget for a ladder and bucket, but there were actors, and I was so unbelievably thrilled.”Then came another course, this time with Jimmy McGovern, after which he asked if she would like to pitch to write an episode of The Street. She got it, and would have written more episodes if breast cancer had not got in the way. “A hiccup,” she says.Through another project she met Simon Beaufoy (“Boofoo, Bow Fort, Bow Fowey … I still can’t say his name”), who wrote The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire. He wasn’t immediately overjoyed by his writing partner for this project, which was about undercover cops. “He said to them, ‘Whatever you do, don’t get an activist, get a writer,’” says Nutter. “And they got me, and he said, ‘They got a fucking activist.’ But then I handed the script in and he realised I was a writer.”That one didn’t work out, but the pair realised they saw eye to eye. So when he created Trust, the big-budget TV series for FX directed by Danny Boyle (Oh Danny Boyle, Danny Boyle, Danny Boyle) among others, he hired Nutter – first to write one episode, then another, then to be involved in the whole thing.Trust rigorously explores money, family and power structures. And not just regarding the dysfunctional Gettys, but also the Italian kidnappers. Is the subject matter, the super rich, surprising for a Tubthumping anarchist to be involved with? No, she says, because it’s full of political themes. “And if you look at really rich people, there’s a socialism in the rich, they share everything with each other. It’s just no one else gets it.”It was also the most fun Nutter has ever had at work. “I just kept thinking: I can’t believe my luck.” Now she’s working on another series with Beaufoy – about happiness, artificial intelligence and algorithms.It’s time for photos. Where does the photographer want her? Somewhere that looks bourgeois, like the flash kitchen, I suggest. “You’re obsessed,” she says. She would give me a lift to the station, but her car has a puncture. Is there an Uber service in Leeds, I wonder? Yes, but she doesn’t use them, on principle. “Once they’ve got the prices down they drive everyone else out.” She calls a local cab company instead. Credentials, credibility, dignity – all remain intact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612122430ed0fb62565fabff08a5ee8a52e09598/0_77_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a113dfce386a00190acee6879268155","title":"alaska houseless lifestyle outdoors hunting","story":"Homeless implies a moral failure while being houseless – lacking a permanent three-dimensional structure – is less stress on the planet and on my brainI am a 64-year-old navy veteran of the Vietnam era and houseless in the tundra, somewhere around 65 degrees north latitude. I have been scrambling around these parts since 2013, inhabiting a variety of iterations, from riverbank tent camps to cabins, buses and RVs and occasionally at fancy lodges when I have worked caretaking gigs. I live like this in protest of our consumer society. I find it more fulfilling, more authentic, less stress – on the planet and on my brain.Feckless? Maybe. Shiftless? Probably. Irresponsible? Absolutely! But homeless? I beg to differ. Homeless implies an inidual moral failure, which may indeed aptly describe one part of my character. Houseless is simply lacking a permanent three-dimensional structure.If you have a place to gather your thoughts and lay your head at the end of the day, how is that not a home? My accommodations are substandard if a house is used as a metric. But my tent keeps me and my bedroll out of most elements in the spring, summer and as far into the fall as I can take it. I find sturdier shelter when the water I soak my false teeth in overnight freezes and I have to chisel them free before I can eat breakfast. Right now, I have a bus with a wood-burning stove in it on loan for the winter, so I’m out of the elements until spring.This ain’t no city slickin’, shopping cart, panhandling kind of houseless. No dumpsters to dine at, no citizens to hassle for donations, no cops to dodge when you need to pee. Most days I see more wildlife than humans. I spend more time traversing dirt than pavement, more paths and game trails than roads and sidewalks. I hear more of nature’s notes than the white noise of civilization, and I can pretty much pee anywhere.If you’re not a moron, community members are not averse to doing you favors, giving you rides or putting you to work – labor can be a barter commodity. And most of these hillbillies are packing heat anyway, so it would behoove one not to be too stupid.In general, stupidity out here in the frozen north usually carries severe consequences: campfires in a dry forest on a windy day easily get out of control sloppy chainsaw, axe or knife work you could lose a finger or cut into an artery and bleed out carelessness near rivers or ice could drown you drinking water from a polluted creek will leave you very sick. Pick berries to eat oblivious to your surroundings and you could get eaten yourself (bears like berries too).People with a penchant for stumbling around drunk and stoned and sleeping it off curbside in the middle of the afternoon probably won’t succeed out here. Discoveries of frozen houseless people regularly make local news headlines. If these folks can’t make in an urban setting with services right around the corner, living in the woods miles from any help is not an option.I’m vague about my location. I don’t want a flock of freakin’ hobos descending on the area like an invasive species only to discover, when the weather gets real, they weren’t prepared and start dropping like the flies do on cold autumn evenings.Hunting and gathering play a large role in the procurement of sustenance at my location. The activities reduce the degree of reliance on injected, processed, wrapped-in-plastic, crammed-into-coolers, industrialized food. We have meat on the hoof out here and I have no qualms about harvesting the resource sustainably. Plus, it’s organic. This ain’t a trophy hunt, this is food!I do still have to rely on some factory food. On my monthly ride on public transportation to the local food bank 30 miles away, I’ll pick up rice, pasta, cereal and milk, some canned goods, fruit, veggies, maybe some soup plus peanut butter and welfare cheese (I hate how much I love that stuff!). I get fruit juice, too. If I add sugar and yeast to the juice it will ferment into a fairly stout libation in a matter of weeks.All in all, though, I prefer a campfire-roasted porcupine that I killed and butchered (recently, one who had smacked my dog with his tail, embedding 15 quills in the mutt’s snout), slathered with highbush cranberry ketchup, foraged chickweed salad with mushrooms on the side, a hot cup of stinging nettle tea to wash it down and a handful of wild blueberries for dessert.Bugs, sticks, sand and assorted forest floor debris sometimes makes it into my vittles but, as the family I encountered in my travels through Canada some years back said when I pointed out that their kid was eating dirt: “It’s clean dirt.” And the bugs are protein! Anyway, I get to devour the feast creekside watching fish sex. No, it’s not the latest Netflix series, it’s actual salmon spawning in the water 10ft from my tent.My living room floor gets a fresh gold carpet when fall colors take over and the tree branches go bare. Daylight starts fading fast closing in on the autumnal equinox and stays in decline till winter solstice, bottoming out at around five and a half hours here. So, I use rechargeable LEDs (a gift from a friend) to read and write by and a headlamp for more active endeavors like ice fishing or splitting firewood.My toilet is a hollow cottonwood stump and I bathe with a kettle of hot creek water. Some places along the highway offer showers but they cost money and contribute to ecocide, so I clean my crotch in the creek occasionally. But personal hygiene is not a priority. I have dirt under my fingernails, belly button lint, maybe some toejam. I often smell like wood smoke from my campfires. My cologne: eau de burnt alder. Instead of washing my clothing – layers come cheap from thrift shops – I air it out, hanging it on a tree branch for a snowstorm or two, then turn it inside out and put it back into rotation.Cabin fever will kick in if you don’t get out and move around, especially in the winter. I have a 10-year-old laptop and a mile hike to the library gets me some wifi and a battery charge. That and a tinny rechargeable battery-operated radio capable of pulling in the nearest NPR signal which, like picking politicians, is the least of the worst, rounds out my engagement with the madness and spiritual corrosion of capitalism and the society it spawns.I also go hiking, snowshoeing, ice skating or cross-country skiing under a big moon. I can fall back into a snowbank with some home-grown and a pint o’ Schnapp’s and watch the northern lights or just get lost in the night sky.Poverty can be a rough row to hoe. It has forced me to seriously compromise the lifestyle and the values I was raised to expect from my perch in a lilywhite midwestern suburb. During my lifelong descent of the economic ladder, which I attribute to my “don’t care” attitude, I got a closeup view of all the unfairness, malfeasance and destructive aspects of “the system”. I was indoctrinated into it, and have gone from struggling to fit in to rejecting the game entirely and looking for alternatives.As a result, my carbon footprint has shrunk. My presence on this planet leaves little trace, which is how I feel it should be. While that’s pleasing to me, I also understand my withdrawal is meaningless in the grand scheme. The world needs systemic change. In my solitude and self-imposed isolation on the side of a mountain in an undisclosed location, I find it all mildly amusing.Living on the edge of the fringe makes for an interesting experience. A bumper sticker on a four-wheeler that roared past me, destroying my zen and and shattering the stillness of the forest path I was traveling read: “If you’re not living on the edge you’re taking up too much space.” I smirk and can’t help but agree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411669ebe333bc48084d672381f223e4f5afd042/0_224_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3936c84c3e0e1598b54a5346e80a9ff7","title":"candy sculpture saudi arabian flag world trade center relocated","story":"Installation, which includes a giant candy sculpture wrapped in the Saudi flag, will be moved following complaintsAn art exhibit installed close to the site of World Trade Center in New York, which includes a giant candy sculpture wrapped in the Saudi Arabian flag, will be relocated following complaints from groups advocating for victims of the terrorist attacks of 911, the agency that oversees the site said on Monday.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed the exhibit Candy Nations will be moved several miles away from lower Manhattan to the John F Kennedy airport AirTrain system, the transportation link that takes passengers from the subway train to the airport terminals in the city borough of Queens.“We have been in contact with the 911 Memorial and various stakeholders, and in full collaboration with the artist will relocate the exhibit from its current location,” the Port Authority said in a statement, referring to 911 as the abbreviated term for the attacks on September 11, 2001, when terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the World Trade Center in New York, into the Pentagon building and into a fatal e in Pennsylvania en route to an unconfirmed target in Washington DC.“We believe this solution respects the unique sensitivities of the site and preserves the artistic integrity of the exhibit,” the statement continued.The site in lower Manhattan that was known as Ground Zero for many years after the attacks is now occupied by a memorial where the World Trade Center’s twin towers once stood, as well as a museum, new skyscrapers including a soaring tower called One World Trade, and a transportation and shopping center.Each of the candy sculptures in the exhibit, crafted by French artist Laurence Jenkell and shown in more than 25 countries, features flags from countries that take part in the Group of 20, or G20, summits.A coalition of family members of 911 victims and survivors released a statement on Monday saying the exhibit’s relocation “is the right thing to do”.Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks that day. And many thousands who dug through the toxic wreckage at Ground Zero or were near the site have become very sick and many have also died. Fifteen of the 19 terrorist attackers were Saudi nationals.Hundreds of victims’ relatives and injured survivors have sued the Saudi government, saying its employees knowingly assisted hijackers who carried out the attacks.The Saudi government has long denied any involvement in the attacks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa108351e4a2a30c271d2dc0f07b3f2adedcc28/40_12_1096_657/master/1096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566a4b67d4e4d713286a58291315a312","title":"a dutch electricians raises issues of trust in iran","story":"Killing at point-blank range of Ali Motamed in the Netherlands shines light on pattern of Iranian hit jobsAli Motamed’s wife had become accustomed to making excuses for her 56-year-old husband. Call-outs for his work as an electrician at the Dutch firm, Eneco, gave a handy reason for missing parties or even weddings without prompting undue curiosity.A quiet, self-contained character around his colleagues, he appeared to them content to stay in watching television at the redbrick home he shared with Galina, 50, and their 17-year-old son on Hendrik Marsmanstraat in the centre of a small estate of cheap modern housing in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam.On 11 December 2015 Motamed had tested his wife’s patience by refusing to go to his brother-in-law’s funeral in France – but he had been right to watch his step that Friday. Two men who had been hired to kill him were sitting outside his home in their stolen BMW, prosecutors would later tell a court.Motamed was saved that day by a late-morning appointment which meant he broke with his usual practice of leaving the house at 6.45am. The assassins, hoping to get to him in the quiet gloom of the morning, were captured on CCTV driving out of Hendrik Marsmanstraat having missed their moment.But Motamed’s luck soon ran out. The following Tuesday, as he emerged from his house into the cold winter air, jogging the few yards from doorstep to bus stop, his killer emerged from the blue BMW to shoot him in the head at point-blank range, before returning to the car and speeding off.Two men, Anouar Aoulad-Buochea, 29, and Moreo Menso, 36, are currently on trial for the murder, an alleged contract killing the Dutch police believe was directed by notorious gangster Naoufal Fassih, known as Noffel on the street, who is already serving an 18-year sentence for arranging a murder for cash. All three men deny involvement.The men accused of the murder had no idea who or why Motamed needed to “sleep”, as it was termed in one of a cache of unencrypted BlackBerry messages, revealed in court evidence. Local police were initially baffled about the motive.But this week the Dutch state made public that they now believe what Motamed’s wife had insisted to police as she was driven to the hospital on the day of her husband’s death: the killing had been ordered by the Iranian government.The killing has opened the eyes of the world to a pattern of Iranian hit jobs, often executed through criminal gangs, that has been seized upon by critics of Iran. To them, the killings raise fresh questions about the trust placed in the country to keep to the contentious accord under which Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia agreed to lift economic sanctions in return for Tehran lowering its nuclear ambitions.The US administration, which pulled out of the deal last year, with the president, Donald Trump, labelling it “rotten”, seized on the development. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US would redouble its efforts “to put real pressure on Iran”.Motamed’s death was, according to a letter to the Dutch parliament, one of two murders of opponents of the Iranian regime on Dutch territory, alongside the 2017 shooting of Ahmad Mola Nissi, the leader of a separatist movement from the Iranian region of Ahwaz, who was found dead by his son Khaled on the doorstep of the family home in The Hague. He had been shot five times with a gun fitted with a silencer. Police are investigating whether the crime is linked to a gang in Rotterdam.Motamed’s real name was Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, an Iranian dissident sentenced to death in absentia after fleeing the country in 1981, accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic party’s headquarters, killing 73 people. Among the dead was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader.Samadi had long known he was on a death list, although he only confided his real name to Galina in 2000, five years into their marriage, and he had withheld the full truth from his son, pledging to tell all when he turned 18.Samadi had avoided events organised by his Afghan wife’s family for fear of pictures of his face emerging on social media. One photograph, taken at his son’s school graduation, appeared on his niece’s Facebook page but he allowed it to be left there “because he had grown older and grey”, and “no one would recognise him any more”, according to the Dutch newspaper, Het Parool. That may have been a misjudgment.Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said that, since the revelation by the government, his intelligence agency was now involved in intense efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian interference in Europe.But the truth is that over four decades Iran is thought to have triggered the assassination of numerous enemies abroad, and critics say the west has been culpable in its silence.Suspected targets include dissident Kurds, leaders of the Ahwaz minority sect and members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq organisation, which allied with Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war. Countries in which assassinations are thought to have been carried out include France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the US.“The Iranian regime has a history of targeting the opposition abroad,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, communications director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. “From the Berlin attack to the assassination of former shah officials. This is a continuation of their previous policy. The current wave of killings follows a rise in attacks inside Iran, perhaps driven by the support of its regional adversaries.”In the wake of the Dutch revelation, ambassadors from Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands visited the Iranian foreign ministry in Tehran “to convey their serious concerns” about the regime’s behaviour. Sanctions were imposed on two iniduals, along with the country’s intelligence agency. Yet, as the measures were imposed, officials were quick to insist that there would be no impact on the nuclear accord with Tehran.The murder of the electrician on Hendrik Marsmanstraat, for all that it was a tragedy for his family and an infringement of Dutch sovereignty, may well prove to be merely a fleeting glimpse into the brutal world of realpolitik."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3ad9c07127b85bf17c2c83cfb3c07ae96b1c01/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30450ea859aeeacd79890071fce485e5","title":"afghanistan talent show justin trudeau lookalike","story":"Wedding singer Abdul Salam Maftoon was called the Canadian prime minister’s ‘lost twin’ after appearing on Afghan StarAn Afghan talent show contestant’s striking resemblance to Justin Trudeau has turned him into an unlikely celebrity in the war-torn country.Abdul Salam Maftoon, a wedding singer from a village in the remote and impoverished northeastern province of Badakhshan, had never even heard of his more famous doppelganger until a judge on the popular television music contest Afghan Star pointed out the uncanny likeness.Slightly built with a long face and dark brown hair and eyes, Maftoon, 29, hopes the flattering comparison to the politician widely rated as one of the sexiest leaders in the world will bring him more votes on Afghanistan’s version of American Idol.“People have forgotten my name and now they just call me ‘Justin Trudeau’,” Maftoon told AFP. “I didn’t know anything about Justin Trudeau until I saw the photos on social media.

The clock was ticking. In six months, the floodplains where he stood would be the site of the largest human gathering in the world, probably ever.“I would watch the water levels going up and down,” the bureaucrat says. “From then my anxiety started.”More than 120 million Hindu devotees, as well as tourists, are expected to visit the north Indian city of Prayagraj over the next few weeks for the Kumbh Mela, a vast spiritual festival at the point where two sacred rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna, converge.As the rivers have emptied of monsoon rain in recent months, Indian authorities have swung into action, reclaiming the riverbed and laying the skeleton for a temporary city that at 15 sq miles (39 sq km) is two-thirds the size of Manhattan.The festival starts on Tuesday morning when tens of thousands of Hindu ascetics will charge – roaring, naked and ash-smeared – into the water, sanctifying it for the tens of millions of pilgrims who will follow in the coming days and weeks.Praygraj is said to be one of four sites in India where drops of the essence of immortality were spilled from an urn being fought over by gods and demons. The festival moves between the four locations, with Prayagraj the largest and most lavish. Pilgrims travel from across the country and wait for days for their opportunity to bathe there for a few seconds, including at least 30 million people on the most auspicious day.“People come here to taste the nectar of immortality,” says Sarabhang Giri, an Australian who was ordained a sadhu, or Hindu saint, in 2004.With an election looming in India, more earthly matters are also under contemplation. For India’s Hindu nationalist government, the Kumbh’s message of unity across the religion’s castes and innumerable deities dovetails nicely with the ruling Bharatiya Janata party’s goal of consolidating Hindu votes.This is the first Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj since the city’s Mughal-era name of Allahabad was changed. No Kumbh Mela has ever been so well funded, or so heavily promoted in the media and on billboards, invariably alongside the face of Narendra Modi, India’s Hindu nationalist prime minister.Pilgrims at the Unesco-listed festival will traverse a pop-up city of more than 185 miles (300km) of roads, nearly two-dozen pontoon bridges, a hospital, 40 police stations and 120,000 toilets. At night, the city is illuminated by more than 40,000 lights. Last Sunday a parade of Hindu ascetics on elephants and camels passed billboards advertising matrimonial websites and the Kumbh’s free wifi.The core of the festival is the estimated 200,000 Hindu saints in attendance, many of whom emerge from seclusion in forests and mountains to take up residency in the tent city, where they perform prayers, administer blessings and lecture on Hindu scripture.Many belong to one of the 13 major sects represented at the fair, first formed as militant defenders of Hindu temples, and who in the past have turned their fire on each other to determine who bathes in the holy river first.“They have physically fought over the order,” says Giri. “Thousands of people have died in Kumbh Melas through history. Now they’ve worked out treaties saying this is the order in which we do it, and if there’s any change, there has to be big discussions.”As well as keeping the peace between holy orders, organisers must work to ward off disease. Some epidemiologists and historians trace the first cholera pandemic of the 19th century to 1817’s Kumbh Mela, from where the infection spread via colonial British naval ships to rest of Asia, Europe and eventually the United States.Apart from building toilets, and deploying an army of more than 9,000 “night sweepers” to collect or treat waste, authorities try to keep the river flowing at an optimum speed of at least 200,000 litres a second: fast enough to avoid stagnation, but not too quick that it washes away bathers.Stampedes are another constant threat. Thirty-six people where killed by a crush at a Prayagraj train station at the most recent event. In 1954, an elephant charged a dense crowd, killing more than 500 people.The key to public safety is to keep the mammoth crowds moving, says Devesh Chaturvedi, the chief public servant who organised Prayagraj’s last Kumbh Mela in 2013. “Even if the water is 500 metres away, we have a system where the pilgrims can be moved for another three or four kilometres.

Over Christmas she received a present of two sports tops from the retailer.“The tops were a little too small for me, so I decided to bring them to Dunnes Stores, Bishopstown, Cork and exchange them for a larger size, on January 5th,” she writes.She could only find one of the original tops in the shop but “as they had lots of nice sports tops, I picked out two different tops instead and went up to customer services to enquire about exchanging the original two tops for these two new sports tops.”She says the girl behind the counter asked her if she had the original receipt and she said she hadn’t as she had received them as a present .“The girl working with her said it was ok to exchange the tops once the Dunnes Stores tags were still on the items. The original tags were on the items, with the price section removed.“The girl proceeded to scan the items and I noticed with surprise that the price of each of the original sports tops came up as being €5. When I queried this (the tops obviously originally cost more than €5), the girl replied that both tops were now discounted to €5 each and as I didn’t have the original receipt, she would only allow me to return them at their current value of €5 each, requiring me to pay the difference on any exchange.”This did not seem like very good value to Maria so she decided to keep the original items and go back to the present giver and see if they still had the receipt for the items.“ Just as I was walking away, I remembered that the zip on one on the tops was broken. I went back to the same customer service girl and asked her if the top was broken was I entitled to exchange it for the same top in a bigger size with a zip that worked (as the original item wasn’t fit for purpose)? She said yes, once she had got manager approval that the item was damaged.“I went and got the original top and brought it up for the exchange. I noticed when I was handing it in that the price on it read €25 and not the ‘now discounted price of €5’ that I’d been told.Maria is annoyed by the policy of returns without a receipt and she wonders if she should have got a credit note for €20 for the exchange on the damaged item, as it was supposedly discounted to €5 at the time she returned it. The original buyer would have paid €25 according to the price tag on it.It is all a bit messy but the retailer is not doing anything wrong. In fact by allowing an exchange without any proof of purchase, it is actually doing more than is required of it by law."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3747826.1546618292!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how i clocked up 625 points in the leaving cert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLiam Mariga, a student at Midleton College, Co Cork, achieved maximum points in his Leaving Cert last year.  Photograph: Jim Coughlan.Liam Mariga was one of just seven students to achieve eight H1s in the Leaving Cert last year. Now studying medicine at Trinity College Dublin, the Cork student\u0026nbspshares his tips on how to make the most of the run-in to the exams. During fifth year, I didn’t do too much extra study. Instead, I just made sure to keep up to date in all my classes and to really try understand the content as opposed to just trying to learn it off, as I believe that this works better for answering exam questions.I have always had a passion for science, so I chose the three sciences and applied maths. In my opinion, it is important to pick subjects that truly interest you, as this will help motivate you during sixth year.In sixth year, I ramped up study, doing three hours on weekdays and five hours on the weekends. After the mocks, I was studying almost fully through past papers, trying to get familiar with questions that repeated.In the English paper, the composition is worth one quarter of the overall mark. This means that a large portion of your time should go in to preparing for this. Obviously, quotes are also very important for the exam. I used to write down a topic, such as a character question, and then find and learn all the quotes that would fit it. There are a good few quotes that can be used for lots of questions, so find them and learn them well. Give yourself plenty of time for quotes so that you’re not going in to the exam gambling on a certain poet or question.In both English papers, timing is crucial. Make sure that you know the time you are meant to spend on each section, and stick to it religiously. You don’t want to waste all your time on a smaller section that might only be worth 30 or 40 marks, and then lose out on a much bigger section because of it.With the oral being worth so much of the overall grade, it is essential to prepare well for the oral exam. Make sure to know all your role plays, and practise steering the conversation towards topics that you know well and are confident with.For the essays, I would advise learning vocabulary for topics as opposed to learning full essays off, as this will give you more room to manoeuvre in the exam. Also, adding a seanfhocail or two will help to clarify your point and show fluency.Learning off key words that are repeated in the listening is a good way to help you as you’ll be able to pick them out with even the hardest accents.With maths, practice is really the key. I started off by answering all of the questions in the textbooks, and then moved on to using past exam papers. I found that I learned much better if I only used the solutions when I was completely stuck. Maths is definitely worth an extra bit of work with the added 25 points, and I also really enjoyed maths, so I spent a good bit of time working at it.If you find yourself really stuck on a certain topic, try looking online for a better method of answering the question or for a better explanation of your current method.For Spanish, our teacher was great at getting us to learn new vocab. Each Monday, we would get a list of 20 or so words, which we would be tested on the next Monday. This really stood to us in the exam, as these words came up in writing the opinion pieces, and also in the comprehensions.I went on a Spanish course in Spain the summer before the Leaving Cert, which really helped both my oral and aural skills. In the oral, it is very important to learn the role plays well, and to also have your answers prepared for each topic, and try your best to show off some advanced vocab if you get the chance.Applied maths was definitely my favourite subject, which really helped me to study for it. As it was my favourite, I would either study it at the start of the day to get focused for study, or leave it until last to give myself a reward to look forward to at the end.With applied maths, the questions really do repeat, so I chose to cover seven topics fully, and also left an eighth as a backup in case the paper didn’t go my way. Once you have covered the basics of each topic, work on all the past questions that you can find on the topics until you are familiar with everything that they ask.With biology, I found it extremely helpful to look at marking schemes and find the key points that the examiners wanted you to know on each topic. Once you finish a chapter or topic, try and answer all the past questions that you can find on it, then correct them against a marking scheme and make notes of the key points that are needed in each question.Remember also that for the shorter-answer questions, the space given for your answer is a good indicator of the level of detail required. This means that there isn’t much point at all in trying to cram in an extra three lines down the side of the page if they aren’t required. This will then free up more time for you to answer the longer questions.Chemistry is probably the best example of a subject where understanding must come before learning. In the exam, you are given plenty of time, so try to answer all the questions you can – remember your best eight questions will be counted!You must make sure to cover the mandatory experiments well, as this can guarantee four of the eight questions for you. Learning how to do the calculations is also important, as almost every question will have one calculation or another.Making sure to have a strong grasp of the basic concepts, such as calculating molarity or balancing equations will really help you in understanding the more complex concepts as they usually have some relation to the more basic concepts.For learning off the titrations, I used to write the equations, indicator and colour change out as often as possible, as these are really helpful for answering the titration question.For physics, the experiments are fairly straightforward to learn, and are worth 30 per cent of the entire paper. Focus on learning the diagrams and equations needed for each experiment, which will hint at the procedures and graphs needed.I personally didn’t like electricity at all, so I learned some of the basic equations that may come up in question five, and pretty much left it after that. Instead, I focused on the other topics and made sure that I had a good understanding of them.The crossover between physics and applied maths really helped with all of the calculations, and there was also some overlap with chemistry too.Once again, checking the marking schemes for keywords is important in physics, as they can be quite specific with some definitions, so make sure that you know them well."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Prime minister admits letter from Juncker and Tusk does not address MPs\u0026rsquo concernsDefeat could see prime minister pivot from hardline Brexiteers towards softer BrexitSpecific updates on medicines and transport issues will be issued to MinistersWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingWe look at the academic, practical, and financial factors students should consider before deciding on a college or courseTimeline for the 2019 college application processWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formThe first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningWatchdog may be forced to cancel registration of facility operated by Brothers of CharityReception and Integration Agency seeking accommodation for up to six monthsMarie Collins claims lessons of abuse in Ireland not being used to change policy elsewhereNaas to Newbridge road had been closed while Gas Networks Ireland dealt with leakMEP to talk about missing entire current European Parliament session due to ill healthNew greenway, hailed as tourism boost, will run between Midleton and Youghal stationsJudge describes Patrick Lynch\u0027s assault on victim as a \u0026lsquomerciless beating\u0026rsquoSilvergrove Nursing Home Ltd claims it will be put out of business over notice"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3757364.1547472060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac treading on embers in investigating %C3%A1ras spending in election run up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Ó Fearghaíl, Ceann Comhairle: “That was a decision that the Public Accounts Committee made itself and it is empowered to make these decisions”. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was “treading on embers” when it decided to investigate spending in Áras an Uachtaráin in the run-up to the presidential election, the Ceann Comhairle has said. Seán Ó Fearghaíl also said the operation of the committee system in the Oireachtas needs to be reviewed, with many committees operating outside their areas of responsibility. The PAC came in for criticism last year for what some claimed was a breach of the traditional constitutional position that the president is not answerable to either house of the Oireachtas.In an interview with The , Mr Ó Fearghaíl said of the PAC: “They were treading on embers at that point by involving themselves in that subject in the run-up, in fact in the course of a campaign.” Mr Fleming and other members of the PAC had argued that their examination focused on the overall spending by the office of the president and was not directed towards Michael D Higgins personally. A focus of the PAC hearing in September was an annual allowance of €317,000 paid to the President. Last month, Áras an Uachtaráin for the first time published a breakdown of how the €317,000 presidential allowance has been spent since President Higgins first took office in 2011.It offered some detail on how it was spent on Áras in-house events, foreign travel representing the country and “books, stationery and research”. It also said an unspent portion of the allowance – a cumulative €238,443 – from Mr Higgins’s first term will be returned to the exchequer.Mr Ó Fearghaíl said that, despite its own misgivings, the PAC can make its own decisions.“That was a decision that the Public Accounts Committee made itself and it is empowered to make these decisions but, personally, it would have been better I think if it didn’t emerge as an issue in the course of the election campaign. I can’t decide what their agenda is.”Recent years have seen a number of Oireachtas committees double up on some issues. There was a clash last year between the chairs of the Health Committee and the PAC over who should examine the CervicalCheck controversy.Mr Ó Fearghaíl, a Kildare South TD, said the committee system should be reviewed when the current Dáil reaches the end of its term, expected to happen in the first half of 2020.“I would think at the end of this term, we should do an overall review of the operation of committees with a particular reference to ensuring that committees stick to their brief. Some committees have had a tendency to wander outside their brief or in fact believe that their brief is such that they can look at anything they want to on any given day,” he told The .The PAC has also been subject to claims that it is too aggressive in its approach to witnesses who appear before it. This has been denied by Mr Fleming and although Mr Ó’Fearghaíl declined to get into the specifics of inidual committees, he said: “For the most part, people are treated with respect and the requirement of the house would be that everybody would be treated with respect.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3758046.1547499481!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"proposal to prevent garda%C3%AD from retiring if under investigation by gsoc","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAssistant commissioner Fintan Fanning is currently suspended and under investigation by Gsoc but is due to retire in August File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has separately called on Gsoc to ensure that any cases being investigated against retiring members of the force are accelerated.Mr Flanagan did not comment on any specific cases but, when asked by The  if a garda should retire with an investigation in which they are involved halted – without any findings made – he said such cases should be given priority.Gsoc is currently investigating claims made against Fintan Fanning, an assistant commissioner, who is due to retire in August after a 39-year career.Mr Fanning disputes the claims against him and has taken a High Court challenge aimed at overturning his “bizarre” and “unlawful” suspension from duty pending the outcome of an investigation by Gsoc.Investigations conducted by Gsoc must cease if the Garda under investigation resigns or retires. Only in cases where a criminal charge is being pursued would the process continue after a Garda member had retired.Gsoc itself has previously argued that it should be permissible to delay the retirement of a garda under investigation, “including non-criminal investigation”. It said that, in its experience, “members under investigation have retired, thus bringing matters to an end”.A spokeswoman for Mr Flanagan says such a proposal is now being considered for inclusion in wider reforms that will follow on foot of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.“The question of either preventing an officer under investigation from retiring or having some leverage after retirement (in non-criminal cases) will be considered,” she said.“However, there will be issues to be resolved such as how a sanction for a disciplinary breach can be imposed on a person who is no longer a Garda.”Government sources said the measure is likely to be implemented and, while it will take some work, Mr Flanagan is “very keen” to see it through.Separately, the Minister said he would like to see Gsoc cases where the officer concerned is retiring given priority. He did not reference any current cases underway.“Yes, I believe it is important that due process take place and in the event of a complaint being made, particularly those of a serious nature, that Gsoc would have the resources to deal with the matter in a timely and appropriate manner.“In response to your question as to retired persons being subject to sanction or retired persons being subject to rulings of Gsoc, this is an issue that will have serious legal consequences and I would be very keen to have that examined before making such a recommendation.”“I would rather that every opportunity be taken to prioritise the case and have it dealt with in the form of due process.”He also stressed the “really important, independent role of Gsoc”, which he said will “be given a greater level of independence” as the recommendations on the Commission of the Future of Policing are implemented over the next year.The Cabinet recently approved the commission’s recommendation that a new, Independent Office of the Police Ombudsman will supersede Gsoc."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3757457.1547481415!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"winter returns ireland braces for incoming polar air mass","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures are set to drop below zero this week.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe waiting game, as the UK tries to decide where to go next on Brexit, is set to overshadow Irish politics in the weeks ahead and is likely to slow parts of the economy for a period as many businesses and consumers “wait and see”.Nor will Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons – assuming it does go ahead – be the end of it, with intense speculation about what would happen if the deal is defeated, but no clarity.The problem in terms of planning – for the Government and for businesses – is the huge range of possible outcomes.The Cabinet is considering a range of sectoral papers on how to cope with a “no-deal” exit, the most disruptive outcome from the Irish viewpoint where the UK leaves with no withdrawal agreement signed. Meanwhile, businesses are now spending significant sums on contingency plans. Other investment and hiring is slowing – according to sources – as everyone waits to see what happens.For Ireland, the short-term outcomes now fall into three boxes.In the first, the withdrawal agreement is – after a defeat on Tuesday – eventually voted through the House of Commons. This would remove the threat of the UK crashing out next March and all the trading rules and regulations changing overnight.The second box is the no-deal, seen now as a bit less likely by some analysts as it’s clearly opposed by a majority in the House of Commons and the EU does not want it either. However, it is still the default option it is what will happen at the end of March unless something is done to stop it.As Fianna Fáil ramps up its criticism of the Government’s no-deal planning, the political stakes are clear. All the parties have supported the backstop strategy. Nonetheless, the party in power always gets the blame when things go wrong. And of course if it all works out, then the Taoiseach will claim a political success.The third box is where there is a delay in the UK’s exit. There has been intense speculation that the two sides will push out the UK’s exit date under Article 50 until the summer – perhaps to late June or early July. All 27 of the remaining EU states would have to agree and, while a second referendum would justify an extension, the rest of the EU will be loath to allow it just so the UK can continue its House of Commons arguments.As the politics plays out in the UK, the backstop – the legal guarantee that no hard border will be needed in Ireland – will remain firmly in focus. Suggestions emerging from the House of Commons that an end date be put on any application of the backstop (one proposed amendment to Tuesday’s vote suggests this be fixed to the end of 2022) would be opposed in Dublin as rendering the backstop useless. So far, sources say there is no sign of pressure from the rest of the EU on Ireland over the issue.Even if the withdrawal agreement is eventually passed, the backstop issue will not go away. The kind of trade deal which, to date, the UK has suggested it wants, would not on its own solve the Irish Border issue. And the UK could use the EU’s assurances of doing everything possible to avoid the backstop – including examining new bureaucratic procedures and technology – to try to push the point as far as possible. The Irish side is content, however, that the legally binding withdrawal agreement remains in place, with its commitment to guaranteeing the backstop “unless and until” it is no longer needed.For now, success for Ireland requires avoiding a no-deal Brexit and keeping the backstop in place. Whether both can be achieved will become clear in the weeks ahead.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph:  Ben BirchallWPA PoolGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has demanded an explanation from prime minister Theresa May after she warned that a no-deal Brexit could spark “changes to everyday life in Northern Ireland” that jeopardise the union.In her speech the prime minister sought to show how much better for the UK her withdrawal agreement was compared with a no-deal Brexit.Just hours ahead of a meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement, she said: “With no deal we would have: no implementation period, no security co-operation, no guarantees for UK citizens overseas, no certainty for businesses and workers here in Stoke and across the UK, and changes to everyday life in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our union at risk.”This provoked uproar from Mr Dodds, whose party has played down the risks of a no-deal Brexit.The DUP believes the Irish border backstop would undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK and bring a united Ireland a step closer by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Both the EU and the British government have been at pains to say that no hard border would return between Ulster and Ireland, a move which would breach the Belfast Agreement.Mr Dodds said: “The prime minister must explain this comment. What exactly would the government be changing?“If this is nothing more than scaremongering, then the prime minister should cease from such foolish talk.“Indeed, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that the Republic of Ireland is not making preparations for a hard border even in the event of no deal being agreed.” – Press AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Specific updates on medicines and transport issues will be issued to Ministers, while the Cabinet will also be briefed on bilateral discussions with the British government on the Common Travel Area between the two countries and on the preparation of Brexit legislation to be enacted before the end of March.Speaking earlier in the day, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had said that Ireland must “hold its nerve” on Brexit.But the Taoiseach declined to say if this meant the Government expected to be subjected to pressure from either Brussels or London to soften its hard line on the backstop.He said that “out of respect for their democracy” he wanted to allow the UK’s parliament to make its decision on Tuesday on the UK-EU withdrawal agreement.“I don’t think it’s in Ireland’s interests for me to be interfering in their internal politics,” he said.The Taoiseach declined to be drawn on the implications of a heavy defeat for Mrs May in Tuesday’s vote.“There’ll be a number of votes,” he said. “After that we’ll assess the situation.”However, Mr Varadkar insisted that ports and airports would be “Brexit ready”.“But I shouldn’t pretend to anyone that there’s going to be any country that can be fully prepared for Brexit,” he said. “There is no good Brexit and a no-deal Brexit will have a very severe impact on Ireland and on Britain and on Europe. But we’ll be as prepared as we possibly can be and certainly as prepared as any other country.”Separately, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said whatever the outcome of the House of Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, Irish interests must be protected North and South.She claimed “many in the British political establishment have played a game of chicken with Ireland, and with Irish interests”, and said it was “a disreputable way to carry out your politics”. Accompanied by Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir and party vice-president Michelle O’Neill as she spoke to the media at Stormont, Ms McDonald said the position of the Democratic Unionist Party opposing the backstop was “reckless and irresponsible”. “It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the North of Ireland,” she said. Speaking yesterday, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that instead of reassuring his party about the backstop, a letter from the EU to British prime minister Theresa May had bolstered their concerns. He said that without any changes to the legally binding withdrawal agreement, nothing of substance had changed. “Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin Government to speak up for us. Instead of meaningless letters, the prime minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: PA WireTheresa May made the case for her Brexit deal at the despatch box of the House of Commons for two hours on Monday afternoon, asking MPs to give it a second look before they vote on Tuesday night. The air of resignation was unmistakable, however, as she acknowledged that the EU’s latest assurances about the Northern Ireland backstop would not persuade the most hardline Conservative Brexiteers and the DUP’s 10 MPs to support her deal.The only question at Westminster last night was about the scale of the prime minister’s defeat and what options for Brexit would remain available after the vote. Limiting the defeat to double digits would amount to something close to a victory for May, maintaining her Brexit deal as the likely basis of any withdrawal plan.A defeat by more than 150, on the other hand, would make it much harder for the prime minister to persuade the EU that a few extra concessions on the backstop would secure a majority at Westminster for her deal.Before MPs vote on the motion on Tuesday night, they must vote on whichever amendments the Speaker selects. Two of those tabled by Monday evening have the potential to reduce the size of the government’s defeat.One by Labour’s Hilary Benn would see MPs reject both May’s deal and a no-deal Brexit, effectively neutralising the main motion, but would probably be opposed by Brexiteers. Another from Andrew Murrison, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, would accept the prime minister’s deal “subject to a legal codicil being added to the Withdrawal Agreement Treaty which specifies that the backstop solution shall expire on 31 December 2022”.May asked MPs to consider how history would judge them if they rejected her deal but former Labour leader Ed Miliband said history’s verdict on her would be determined by how she responded to a defeat on Tuesday.“I say to her in the strongest terms that the tone and substance she strikes in the wake of that eventuality will define her legacy to this country,” he said.“I want to urge her also, if she loses tomorrow night, to give this House an open and honest process where it can express its view, and she and the Government then become the servant of this House in the negotiations.”A defeat on Tuesday could see the prime minister pivot away from the hardline Brexiteers and the DUP towards a cross-party consensus around a softer Brexit than she has advocated until now. Such a move could open the way for some softening on the backstop from the EU side if the emerging parliamentary vision of Brexit points to a full customs union and more regulatory alignment.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May speaks at a  factory in  Stoke-on-Trent on Monday where she  called on MP’s to support her Brexit bill in a vote on Tuesday. Photograph: AFPThe EU has promised British MPs that the use of a contentious backstop plan for Northern Ireland will be “as short as possible”, in an exchange of letters aimed at bolstering British prime minister Theresa May ahead of a historic House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal.The three-page letter from Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Donald Tusk, European Council president, includes no significant revisions or additions to the terms of Britain’s Brexit package.But the two leaders stress they expect any use of the Irish backstop - which many Brexiters say would “trap” the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU - would be “temporary” and replaced “as quickly as possible”.While Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk’s assurances could help Mrs May remind MPs of the main elements of her deal, they fall short of UK requests to insert a new target date for both sides to make efforts to ensure that the backstop would only be used for a year, if it had to be triggered at all.The letter came as Mrs May warned eurosceptic MPs that rejecting the package risked “paralysis” in parliament and “no Brexit”. Mrs May said she believed parliament blocking Brexit was now a more likely outcome than the UK leaving without a deal.“It’s now my judgment that a more likely outcome is a paralysis in parliament that risks no Brexit,” she said on a visit to Stoke-on-Trent, a heavily Leave-voting Midlands city. “There are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so.”Mrs May hopes to keep the scale of the defeat to a margin of less than 100 in Tuesday evening’s vote, but some Conservative MPs predict Mrs May could lose by more than 200.The pro-EU Commons indicated last week that it would block a no-deal Brexit. It voted to limit the government’s tax-raising powers in the event of no deal and passed an amendment requiring Mrs May to present a Plan B within three working days if her deal is defeated.Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk stressed in their letter that they were “not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement” - the 585-page treaty outlining the terms of Britain’s departure, including the backstop plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Mr Juncker had supported giving more generous assurances on the backstop, which would seek to avoid a hard border in Ireland by keeping Britain in a customs union with the EU and tying Northern Ireland even more closely to EU rules.But Mr Tusk and some member states argued for a more conservative approach that stuck closely to the language in the Brexit package.The letter repeats previous assurances from the EU to work on concluding a UK-EU free trade deal, which Mr Juncker said “might” mean the backstop is either never triggered or replaced.In a letter of her own to the EU institutions, Mrs May had noted some MPs’ fear that Brussels will not handle trade negotiations “energetically or ambitiously” or “down tools altogether and leave the UK permanently in the backstop arrangement”.In response, Mr Juncker confirmed the commission saw the backstop as “a suboptimal trading relationship for both sides” that it “does not wish” to see enforced.In a nod to the technological border solutions preferred by some Brexiters, the letter says that “facilitative arrangements and technologies will be considered” as alternatives to the backstop.The withdrawal agreement already includes a clause that promises both sides’ “best endeavours” to agree a future relationship before the end of Britain’s transition period at the end of 2020.Should this target be missed and the backstop come into force, Mr Juncker promises that the commission, which leads negotiations for the EU, will “redouble its efforts” with the aim “of concluding a subsequent agreement very rapidly”.“The commission is committed to providing the necessary political impetus and resources to help achieving the objective of making this period as short as possible,” the commission president adds.Mr Tusk, who represents the European Council of EU leaders, takes a more cautious approach on the pace and nature of future trade negotiations, repeating the conclusions of a December summit that called for the backstop to be only used for as long as “strictly necessary”.He adds that the summit conclusions, while not legally binding, could have “legal value” to the extent that such agreements are supposed to set priorities for the union.“They may commit the European Union in the most solemn manner,” Mr Tusk said. To the surprise of some EU diplomats, Mrs May had implied in December that summit conclusions had legal weight.British officials now stress the potential importance of Mr Tusk accepting that the summit conclusions and the exchange of letters are “part of the context” in which the treaty “will be interpreted”.A spokesman for Mr Juncker said the EU would not now “engage in interpreting the interpretation or clarifying the clarification” of the letter’s content ahead of the meaningful vote. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3757226.1547461984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit what s happening this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMPs should finally get to vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on TuesdayThe EU is expected to publish a letter of clarification emphasising that any use of the Northern Ireland backstop designed to keep the land border open would only ever be temporary, although it will be a surprise if it makes much difference to the Commons arithmetic.Theresa May will also make a public appeal for support in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent in the morning, while MPs move on to day four of the Brexit debate, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, closing proceedings. Monday night is the deadline for submitting amendments to the Brexit motion.If May allows it, MPs will finally get to vote on her Brexit deal, although few believe the prime minister can get it approved, given that more than 100 Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.John Bercow, the speaker, will select which amendments to vote on. The one to watch is the Hilary Benn amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and no deal, and gives MPs a say in what happens next.The prime minister will conclude proceedings, speaking just before voting starts at 7pm. A result on the Benn amendment could come at about 7.30pm. If that falls, the all-important vote on Mrs May’s final deal is expected between 8pm and 9pm. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, could immediately demand to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, if she is defeated. A heavy loss, and Mrs May will face immediate calls to resign.If Mrs May were to prevail, business as usual would commence, starting with prime minister’s questions. But the DUP has threatened to abandon its confidence-and-supply agreement with the government if May’s deal goes through, leaving the Conservatives without an overall majority.A confidence vote could be held on Wednesday, if Corbyn calls for one. It will be hard for Labour to win, because in this scenario, if Mrs May’s deal is voted down, the DUP has said it will support the Conservatives in an attempt to get the Brexit deal renegotiated.If she suffers a heavy defeat – perhaps with 80 rebels or more – she may find she is not able to stay on. A more narrow defeat – 40 rebels or fewer – could encourage her to try to ask MPs to vote on the deal again, although it will almost certainly need to be revised first.Mrs May could make a dash to Brussels to see if there is any hope of renegotiating. If defeated, she has until the close of business on Monday, January 21st, to tell MPs what her plan B is the Commons would then debate and vote on that later in the week.The prime minister could seek a general election, which Labour would support, but her own party may not. Soft Brexiters in the Conservative party could break ranks to see if there is majority support for the UK remaining in the customs union, and even the single market.Campaigners for a second referendum see this as their moment to strike: believing that their idea needs to be the last one standing – the only option that could achieve a majority in the house amid a crisis atmosphere. Except that there would then be an argument about what options should be on the ballot paper.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

On Monday night, aides said Ms Siddiq had asked to ensure she could be driven to Westminster and a wheelchair would be made available so she could vote.Relations between Conservative and Labour whips have deteriorated in the past year, with claims the government resorted to dirty tricks and playing hardball in order to win key votes.The Labour backbencher Naz Shah was pushed through the ision lobby in a wheelchair while wearing pyjamas last June, at a time when she was recovering from a serious illness, because the Conservatives refused to allow her to be nodded through.Brandon Lewis, the Conservative chairman, controversially voted in two knife-edge Brexit votes last July when he was supposed to abstain to honour an agreed pairing with the Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave at the time.Ms Siddiq told the Standard: “If the pairing system is not honoured, there’s nothing I can do, and it’s going to be a very close vote. I’ve had no pressure at all from the whips to come and vote, but this is the biggest vote of my lifetime.”-  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  PA WireA no-deal Brexit would make a united Ireland and the break-up of the United Kingdom more likely, Theresa May has told MPs ahead of Tuesday’s vote on the deal she has negotiated with the European Union. The prime minister acknowledged that the fresh assurances she received from the EU on Monday would not satisfy those who wanted Britain to be able to leave the Northern Ireland backstop unilaterally.She said the EU would not agree to such a mechanism or to a date on which the backstop should expire but she said that rejecting the backstop meant leaving the EU without a deal.“Whatever version of the future relationship you might want to see – from Norway to Canada to any number of variations – all of them require a withdrawal agreement and any withdrawal agreement will contain the backstop. And that is not going to change however the House votes tomorrow,” she told the House of Commons.“And to those who think we should reject this deal in favour of no deal, because we cannot get every assurance we want, I ask what would a no-deal Brexit do to strengthen the hand of those campaigning for Scottish independence – or indeed those demanding a border poll in Northern Ireland? Surely this is the real threat to our union.”Facing almost certain defeat on Tuesday night, Mrs May asked MPs to take a second look at her Brexit deal, telling them that history would judge them harshly if they failed to deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that nothing in the deal had changed because she had failed to achieve legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement.Former Conservative Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson said it was “extraordinary and exasperating” that the backstop should be an issue given that nobody would build a hard border. The prime minister said he was mistaken.“It is not the case that the European Union has said that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The no-deal plans published by the European Commission in December make it clear that there will be no flexibility on border checks in no deal, so the Irish Government will be expected to apply EU checks in full,” she said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday’s letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk meant nothing and accused the prime minister of trying to blame others for her failure to secure a better deal. He said MPs should ignore her warnings that they would undermine public faith in democracy if they rejected her deal.“I can think of no greater example of democracy in action than for this House to reject a deal that is clearly bad for Britain. During the past two years of these shambolic negotiations the prime minister has failed to listen,” he said.“She hasn’t once tried to work with parliament to construct a Brexit deal this House and the country can support. And now she is left facing a humiliating defeat. She is blaming everybody else but herself.”Addressing Labour MPs later, Mr Corbyn predicted that Mrs May’s deal would be defeated and suggested he would move quickly to table a motion of no confidence in the government.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Yves HermanIllustrationReuters“The EU have said throughout that they would not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement or reopen its text for alteration, and that remained the case throughout my discussions at the December European Council and since,” she said during a visit to a factory in Stoke-on-Trent. “I also pursued in these discussions a proposal for a fixed date – with legal force – guaranteeing the point at which the future partnership would come into force. Because that is the way to bring an end to the backstop – by agreeing our new relationship. The EU’s position was that – while they never want or expect the backstop to come into force – a legal time limit was not possible.”DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that instead of reassuring his party about the backstop, the letter had bolstered their concerns. He said that without any changes to the legally binding withdrawal agreement nothing of substance had changed.“Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. Instead of meaningless letters, the prime minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement,” he said.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer dismissed the letter as a reiteration of the EU’s existing position and Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the letter did nothing to solve the issue of the Border.“It is all well and good to say they can consider ‘facilitative arrangements and technologies’ but this is not a reality. The technology that would allow seamless trade across the Irish border simply does not exist,” Mr Brake said.“If we do not have a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, there will be red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and jobs will be lost. It is time Theresa May was honest with the British public and offered them a way out of this mess with a people’s vote, with the option to remain in the EU.”A handful of Conservative MPs have dropped their opposition to Mrs May’s deal in recent days, promising to vote for it on Tuesday night. But Conservative Gareth Johnson has resigned as a whip to vote against it and MPs are expected to reject the deal by an overwhelming margin.A cross-party group of backbenchers is seeking to change parliamentary procedural rules to charge the Commons liaison committee with finding a new approach to Brexit if Mrs May cannot win a majority for a deal within three weeks of a defeat on Tuesday. The prime minister warned MPs that voting for her deal was the only way of ensuring that there would not be a no-deal Brexit but that Britain would definitely leave the EU.“You can take no deal off the table by voting for that deal. And if no deal is a bad as you believe it is, it would be the height of recklessness to do anything else,” she said.“But while no deal remains a serious risk, having observed events at Westminster over the last seven days, it is now my judgment that the more likely outcome is a paralysis in Parliament that risks there being no Brexit. That makes it even more important that MPs consider very carefully how they will vote tomorrow night.”UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox wrote to Mrs May to say that the EU’s reassurances in the Tusk-Junker letter on the backstop had some legal force and he thought it was unlikely that the EU wished to implement it.Mr Cox said that while the EU’s conclusion - that Brussels would work speedily towards agreeing a trade agreement to avoid the backstop being triggered - did not alter the “fundamental meanings” of the backstop - that the UK could be indefinitely committed to EU customs rules if future trade talks broke down, as he advised in November. “The balance of risks favours the conclusion that it is unlikely that the EU will wish to reply on the implementation of the backstop provisions,” said the attorney general.He said the draft withdrawal agreement “now represents the only politically practicable and available means of securing our exit from the European Union.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit vote latest news: Labour expected to call for no confidence vote tomorrow if Theresa May deal defeatedTrue Detective, season 3 episode 1 and 2 review: back on form and already addictiveComment: MPs need to trust the voters and have confidence in Britain\u0026#39s ability to thrive after BrexitPolice chiefs to brand county lines gang bosses \u0026#39slave drivers\u0026#39 to disrupt their use of children to deal drugsJayme Closs case: Suspect Jake Patterson \u0026#39saw her on school bus\u0026#39 and decided to snatch teenagerDuke and Duchess of Sussex get hugs and teddy bears in Birkenhead on first royal engagement of 2019How Theresa May resorted to pleading, threats and dire warnings in last-ditch bid to save her Brexit dealComment: It would be madness to consign ourselves to EU leaders\u0026#39 mercies Theresa May \u0026#39will have to stand down\u0026#39 if she suffers heavy defeat in Brexit vote, Cabinet ministers suggestComment: Why MPs should put aside their reservations and back the Prime Minister\u0026#39s dealMan \u0026#39wielding machete on train station platform\u0026#39 tasered and held on suspicion of attempted murder The 100 Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Zimbabwe security forces fire on protesters amid anger over fuel price hikesSouth Korean animal charity \u0026#39killed dogs rescued from meat farms\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn to table motion of no confidence moments after Theresa May\u0026#39s expected record defeatComment: I cannot vote for a deal that squanders Brexit and betrays the British people Could goat meat be the new foodie trend of 2019?Jailed banker\u0026#39s £1m ring from Harrods seized by crime agencyBritish Cambridge graduate found dead \u0026#39in a pool of blood\u0026#39 at his home in St LuciaMacron puts immigration quotas up for debate in hope of placating \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39Sergei Polunin dropped by Paris Opera Ballet after homophobic rantWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"micro needles could future long lasting contraception","story":"An experimental microneedle patch is shown next to a blister pack of birth control pillsA temporary patch which leaves hundreds of tiny needles under a patient’s skin could be used to deliver long-lasting contraception, a study has found. Designed to be self-administered, the technology would give women with limited and irregular access to healthcare more control over family planning, particularly in developing countries. The patch contains at least 100 microneedles, which are attached to a small disc of plastic. When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit vote latest news: Labour expected to call for no confidence vote tomorrow if Theresa May deal defeatedTrue Detective, season 3 episode 1 and 2 review: back on form and already addictiveComment: MPs need to trust the voters and have confidence in Britain\u0026#39s ability to thrive after BrexitPolice chiefs to brand county lines gang bosses \u0026#39slave drivers\u0026#39 to disrupt their use of children to deal drugsJayme Closs case: Suspect Jake Patterson \u0026#39saw her on school bus\u0026#39 and decided to snatch teenagerDuke and Duchess of Sussex get hugs and teddy bears in Birkenhead on first royal engagement of 2019How Theresa May resorted to pleading, threats and dire warnings in last-ditch bid to save her Brexit dealComment: It would be madness to consign ourselves to EU leaders\u0026#39 mercies Theresa May \u0026#39will have to stand down\u0026#39 if she suffers heavy defeat in Brexit vote, Cabinet ministers suggestComment: Why MPs should put aside their reservations and back the Prime Minister\u0026#39s dealMan \u0026#39wielding machete on train station platform\u0026#39 tasered and held on suspicion of attempted murder The 100 Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Zimbabwe security forces fire on protesters amid anger over fuel price hikesSouth Korean animal charity \u0026#39killed dogs rescued from meat farms\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn to table motion of no confidence moments after Theresa May\u0026#39s expected record defeatComment: I cannot vote for a deal that squanders Brexit and betrays the British people Could goat meat be the new foodie trend of 2019?Jailed banker\u0026#39s £1m ring from Harrods seized by crime agencyBritish Cambridge graduate found dead \u0026#39in a pool of blood\u0026#39 at his home in St LuciaMacron puts immigration quotas up for debate in hope of placating \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39Sergei Polunin dropped by Paris Opera Ballet after homophobic rantWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no pants subway ride 2019 pictures","story":"First things first.. pants as in trousers, the American usage !

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces.

had to rely on third-party companies like Belkin to make charging stations for the iPhone X, iPhone Xs and other products with wireless charging capabilities.The big selling point for Apple’s AirPower mat is its ability to charge up to three different products at the same time.AirPower wireless charger is displayed along with other products during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California (Reuters)It is the difficulty of engineering a\u0026nbspmat\u0026nbspcapable of charging multiple devices at once that has led to delays in the production, according to some industry insiders.Notorious Apple leaker Sonny Dickson previously said the issues with the charging mat included overheating and interference.There is still no word on when the release date or price for the

The boxes\u0026nbspalso include a water filter and firelighter system.The product has\u0026nbspbeen much more popular than expected and has\u0026nbsphelped to drive up sales of the company’s other emergency food products, Mr Blake said.No-deal Brexit \u0027catastrophic\u0027 for UK food supplies, say farmersAsked whether people would really need to turn to such supplies because of Brexit, he said: “People need to be prepared. What they do is entirely up to them but people should have a bit of forward planning so that they can feel more confident if something happens that they have a few days’ worth of food there to fall back on.”“It may all go swimmingly and everything will turn out fine, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen. No one seems to know what’s going on at the moment.”He added: “If the worst happens, the predictions are correct and there is chaos at border, that would be a catastrophe. None of us want this.”\u0026nbspThe government’s preparations for disruption at UK ports attracted widespread derision last week when 89 lorry drivers were each paid £550 each to take part in a “live test” of post-Brexit readiness.Former Conservative chairman Lord Patten described the exercise as a “taxpayer funded farce”, adding: “The idea that creating a fake traffic jam will show the EU we are ready for a no deal is just plain stupid.”Tinned supplies in the Brexit boxes last for 25 years, while the food in packets is good for seven years, meaning that they could be used for other future eventualities if not required after Brexit.Emergency Food Storage UK insists it is not taking advantage of people’s fears about a no-deal Brexit and says it does not make a “huge profit” from each box.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Here is the full line-up of the 2019 War Child Brits Week:Monday, 18 February – Jake Bugg with special guest Jade Bird – OmearaThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While young people can still find it very hard to get on the job ladder, the report\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspthey have\u0026nbspparticularly benefited those aged 50 and under.\u0026nbspNor has the growth, by contrast to the popular view, been swept up by London and the South East at the expense of the rest of the country. The largest improvements since 2008 have, for example, been in South Yorkshire\u0026nbsp(up 6.5 per cent), and Merseyside (6.4 per cent).There have inevitably been losers as well as winners but the central point - that employment levels are at all time highs and the benefits have been spread widely - holds. Given that it’s always better have a job than not to have one, and there are a lot more of them than Britain has been accustomed to having in previous decades, why they angst?Perhaps it can be explained by another of the report’s conclusions. Yes there are more jobs, but they are also more insecure.\u0026nbspStatistics showing record employment, and ministers’ boastful claims of credit for that, mean little to people constantly worrying about the jobs they have being taken away, particularly when they have financial commitments linked to them,\u0026nbspsuch as mortgages and other loans.Those hardest hit by job insecurity are those in part time or agency work and\u0026nbspthose on the much criticised zero hours contacts. Britain has 780,000 people in that situation,\u0026nbspand 950,000 agency workers. One in seven workers, meanwhile, are now self-employed. All of those figures, notes the Foundation, are significantly above pre-crisis levels.Another issue is that of pay. Average annual\u0026nbsp‘real’ inflation adjusted earnings are still £470 lower than they were a decade ago. Too many people are in jobs that leave them struggling to cover their outgoings. The Conservative Party’s cuts to welfare have not been compensated for by the increases they have made to the minimum wage, which has\u0026nbspled to the phenomenon\u0026nbspof rapidly\u0026nbsprising\u0026nbspin work poverty.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The boxes\u0026nbspalso include a water filter and firelighter system.The product has\u0026nbspbeen much more popular than expected and has\u0026nbsphelped to drive up sales of the company’s other emergency food products, Mr Blake said.No-deal Brexit \u0027catastrophic\u0027 for UK food supplies, say farmersAsked whether people would really need to turn to such supplies because of Brexit, he said: “People need to be prepared. What they do is entirely up to them but people should have a bit of forward planning so that they can feel more confident if something happens that they have a few days’ worth of food there to fall back on.”“It may all go swimmingly and everything will turn out fine, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen. No one seems to know what’s going on at the moment.”He added: “If the worst happens, the predictions are correct and there is chaos at border, that would be a catastrophe. None of us want this.”\u0026nbspThe government’s preparations for disruption at UK ports attracted widespread derision last week when 89 lorry drivers were each paid £550 each to take part in a “live test” of post-Brexit readiness.Former Conservative chairman Lord Patten described the exercise as a “taxpayer funded farce”, adding: “The idea that creating a fake traffic jam will show the EU we are ready for a no deal is just plain stupid.”Tinned supplies in the Brexit boxes last for 25 years, while the food in packets is good for seven years, meaning that they could be used for other future eventualities if not required after Brexit.Emergency Food Storage UK insists it is not taking advantage of people’s fears about a no-deal Brexit and says it does not make a “huge profit” from each box.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MPs are widely expected to reject the deal, and analysts say the uncertainty about what the next steps would be means the pound could veer sharply up or down later this week. The pound hovered around $1.2861 for most of Monday, but jumped briefly against both the euro and the dollar in the late afternoon on reports that the ERG plans to support Ms May’s deal. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf the prime minister responds to a defeat by attempting to introduce another revised deal, as she has done before, the pound is likely to tumble.Sterling would also likely slump if a rejection of this deal leads to a breakdown of the government. In December, the currency plunged against the dollar and the euro when Ms May delayed the first planned vote on her deal. A defeat will almost definitely lead to a temporary slip in the pound, traders have warned. However, if rejection of the deal\u0026nbspmakes it more likely that a second referendum will be called, the pound could be boosted. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: “The best-case scenario is probably the can being kicked down the road. That is, Theresa May is given the chance to improve the deal and hold a second meaningful vote in a few weeks.Is May’s Brexit deal heading for the biggest ever commons defeat?Labour MEPs ask Jeremy Corbyn to back second EU referendumLabour MP to delay birth of child to vote against Brexit dealWe should be able to change our minds about BrexitCould I have done more to stop Brexit?“But kicking the can too far will have negative consequences. It seems likely there simply will not be time to make the necessary changes in May\u0027s deal before 29 March, especially if there is a general election.” Mr Lawler added that, while “anecdotally, the Brexit-voting public seem very comfortable with exiting the EU without a deal... there is very little taste for it in parliament”. He said the most likely next options are a Brexit delay by revoking or extending Article 50. This could pull sterling up in the short term, Mr Lawler said, but he warned: “The resulting uncertainty would be one of the worst scenarios for businesses and the British economy.”There is always a chance that the vote could go in favour of the deal, although this would by a surprise to the market. “Should the withdrawal act be ratified on Tuesday, sterling will likely surge around 5 per cent in value against the US dollar,” said Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe, but he added that “if December’s failed attempt is anything to go by then the chances look slim”.Mr Harvey agreed that the most likely outcome of a defeat would be further delays to the Brexit process. “The tight turnaround period to deliver the next steps for a ‘plan B’ seems unachievable if the current deal making process is anything to go by,” he said, adding that “there is a palatable appetite for a delay in the Brexit process as seen by the brief rally after unconfirmed sources reported that Article 50 will be extended”. Mr Harvey also warned: “The possibility of a snap election or a second referendum remain a tail risk in the event of a defeat on Tuesday, but given the current political landscape, they can’t be ruled out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The probe is shown adjusting its altitude, speed and pitch as it seeks to avoid obstacles on the ground.\u0026nbspResearchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and birth of the universe\u0027s first stars.\u0026nbspThe far side has been observed many times from lunar orbits, but never explored on the surface. It is popularly called the dark side because it can\u0027t be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.\u0026nbspThe pioneering landing highlights China\u0027s ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space through manned flights and the planned construction of a permanent space station.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Fellowes\u0026nbspdescribed it as such in a previous interview with\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp”You tune in and you see the real house, you meet the characters, and it says something like ‘Waterloo’ and you press Waterloo and you get ‘Waterloo was a battle fought on the 18 June 1815...’I think it seems rather a laugh.”Fellowes has also written the screenplay for the upcoming\u0026nbspDownton\u0026nbspAbbey\u0026nbspfilm, set to be released in September 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MPs are widely expected to reject the deal, and analysts say the uncertainty about what the next steps would be means the pound could veer sharply up or down later this week. The pound hovered around $1.2861 for most of Monday, but jumped briefly against both the euro and the dollar in the late afternoon on reports that the ERG plans to support Ms May’s deal. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf the prime minister responds to a defeat by attempting to introduce another revised deal, as she has done before, the pound is likely to tumble.Sterling would also likely slump if a rejection of this deal leads to a breakdown of the government. In December, the currency plunged against the dollar and the euro when Ms May delayed the first planned vote on her deal. A defeat will almost definitely lead to a temporary slip in the pound, traders have warned. However, if rejection of the deal\u0026nbspmakes it more likely that a second referendum will be called, the pound could be boosted. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: “The best-case scenario is probably the can being kicked down the road. That is, Theresa May is given the chance to improve the deal and hold a second meaningful vote in a few weeks.Is May’s Brexit deal heading for the biggest ever commons defeat?Labour MEPs ask Jeremy Corbyn to back second EU referendumLabour MP to delay birth of child to vote against Brexit dealWe should be able to change our minds about BrexitCould I have done more to stop Brexit?“But kicking the can too far will have negative consequences. It seems likely there simply will not be time to make the necessary changes in May\u0027s deal before 29 March, especially if there is a general election.” Mr Lawler added that, while “anecdotally, the Brexit-voting public seem very comfortable with exiting the EU without a deal... there is very little taste for it in parliament”. He said the most likely next options are a Brexit delay by revoking or extending Article 50. This could pull sterling up in the short term, Mr Lawler said, but he warned: “The resulting uncertainty would be one of the worst scenarios for businesses and the British economy.”There is always a chance that the vote could go in favour of the deal, although this would by a surprise to the market. “Should the withdrawal act be ratified on Tuesday, sterling will likely surge around 5 per cent in value against the US dollar,” said Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe, but he added that “if December’s failed attempt is anything to go by then the chances look slim”.Mr Harvey agreed that the most likely outcome of a defeat would be further delays to the Brexit process. “The tight turnaround period to deliver the next steps for a ‘plan B’ seems unachievable if the current deal making process is anything to go by,” he said, adding that “there is a palatable appetite for a delay in the Brexit process as seen by the brief rally after unconfirmed sources reported that Article 50 will be extended”. Mr Harvey also warned: “The possibility of a snap election or a second referendum remain a tail risk in the event of a defeat on Tuesday, but given the current political landscape, they can’t be ruled out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is gutter politics.\u0026nbsp“History shows us appeasement only emboldens the far right and impoverishing the country through Brexit will only increase resentment.”Ms Soubry, who was branded a Nazi\u0026nbspby a mob who targeted her during live television interviews outside parliament on Monday, described Mr Grayling\u0027s comments as irresponsible nonsense.She tweeted: The 15 yobs who have been roaming outside parliament do not represent anyone but themselves. It\u0027s shameful to validate them in this way.Right-wing extremists have always existed. Brexit is just an excuse - this is their real agenda.Pro-EU MP Luciana\u0026nbspBerger\u0026nbspaccused Mr Grayling of “cowering behind the small threat of far-right extremism” to avoid offering the public another referendum.The Labour MP, who has been subjected to relentless abuse and death threats, said: “These remarks are not only grossly irresponsible but also show just how desperate supporters of this proposed withdrawal agreement have become.“We absolutely need to heal isions in our society but we will not do so with a Brexit that makes us poorer and offers less control.“And the answer to a small band of far-right thugs roaming the streets must never be to capitulate and restrict our democratic engagement – it must be more democracy.”Labour veteran Roy\u0026nbspHattersley\u0026nbspdismissed the claims as “absurd”, adding: “I don’t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters.”Lord\u0026nbspHattersley, a former Labour deputy leader who backs a Final Say referendum, told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: “Nobody voted for Mrs May’s package. Nobody had the faintest idea what Mrs May’s package would be.“It’s only reasonable that now we do know what it amounts to, what leaving really means, that people have an opportunity to vote on that. It’s a different vote.”Lord Hattersley was due to address a People’s Vote rally in Sheffield on Saturday, along with Dame Margaret Beckett and Sir Vince Cable, but had to pull out due to illness.The row over the transport secretary’s comments comes after a week of heightened tensions in Westminster, when\u0026nbspBrexit secretary Stephen Barclay was condemned by MPs for saying\u0026nbspthe abuse hurled at MPs showed it would be too “isive” to stage another public vote.The Independent revealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

She\u0026nbspsaid the Conservatives had always been successful because they had been willing to compromise.She warned again, as she and other ministers have done before, how difficult achieving a no-deal Brexit will be and how damaging it could be to Britain.Minister Nadhim Zahawi said she had told them they needed to deliver on Brexit and prevent\u0026nbspa Labour government.“She said we have got to keep Jeremy Corbyn as far away as possible from No 10,” he said.\u0026nbsp“To do that, we have got to come together.”Among those who backed her message were foreign office minister Alistair Burt who told Brexiteers in the room to “accept the fact that they have won” and “to bank that and move on to the next stage”.Solicitor general Robert Buckland said the meeting was in a “sombre, reflective” mood, but key figures in the European Research Group, Steve Baker and Mark Francois, left indicating that Ms May’s appeal had fallen on deaf ears.Much of the opposition to her deal to focuses on the hated “Irish backstop”, which would come into play if no future trading arrangement is in place by December 2020, and could keep the UK in a customs union indefinitely.Earlier in the day, Andrew Murrison MP tabled an amendment to the Brexit motion to create a “sunset clause” preventing the backstop extending beyond the end of 2021.It was one of a series of amendments that speaker John Bercow could call to be voted on ahead of the main vote on Tuesday. Others include an\u0026nbspaim to secure a new referendum and block a no-deal Brexit.Downing Street are said to be supportive of the Murrison plan but have not explicitly said so, with some ministers having suggested that if it is passed, it would give Ms May an opportunity to return to Brussels with a mandate for further renegotiation.On Monday, Ms May set out the details of assurances given\u0026nbspin a joint letter from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker over the hated “Irish backstop”’, which is preventing so many of her MPs from supporting her deal.She said she knew some MPs wanted a mechanism to allow the UK to decide unilaterally to exit the backstop or a\u0026nbsptime limit to the arrangement.Created with Sketch.

But, as\u0026nbspJoe Watts\u0026nbspexplains, other prime ministers have fared just as badlyClick to followIndy Politics‘How many votes?’There are few things that everyone agrees on in the Brexit debate, but one of them is that Theresa May is heading for a historic defeat on Tuesday.Knowing the exact number of votes that she will lose by when MPs make their decision soon after 7pm on 15\u0026nbspJanuary is difficult, with some last minute mind-changing likely.But for some time now estimates have been that around 100 from her own benches could ally with the opposition parties and move\u0026nbspagainst her. Even friendly MPs say it would be a victory for Ms May\u0026nbspif the numbers of Tories opposing her is\u0026nbspin double digits.EU ‘reassures’ Theresa May on Brexit deal but says it can’t be changedTo understand just how bad a defeat that\u0026nbspwould be, it helps to take a look back at some of the bigger losses in parliamentary history.The largest and most controversial ision in recent times was that over the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when 139 Labour MPs stood against Tony Blair’s plans to start a new war in the Middle East.It was the biggest parliamentary rebellion in any party since the repeal of the corn laws in the 1840s, when Sir Robert Peel sought to scrap tariffs on imported corn that led to steep increases in food prices for the British public.Despite the huge opposition to the war in Iraq on Labour benches, Mr Blair won parliament’s backing because of the support of the opposition, led by Conservative Iain Duncan Smith.Ms May will not be so lucky, with Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn steadfastly opposed to her Brexit deal. This means the rebellion on her own side will (probably)\u0026nbspnot only be bigger in scale, but more politically significant because it will inflict an embarrassing defeat on the government.The largest Conservative rebellion of modern times was in 1997 during the final months of\u0026nbspJohn Major’s administration.Could I have done more to stop Brexit?It saw 95 Tory MPs defy the whip to vote against the then prime minister’s plans to pass tighter gun control laws in the wake of the Dunblane massacre.A similar sized rebellion, of 91 MPs in total, was suffered by David Cameron when he tried to pass legislation relating to Lords reform in 2012, during his party’s coalition with the Liberal Democrats.The new proposals were\u0026nbspbrought forward by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, but were scuppered by Tory backbenchers in a tit-for-tat parliamentary battle, which also saw the smaller coalition party block a Conservative plan to reshape constituencies.A rebellion of around 90 MPs for Ms May would be seen as a win of\u0026nbspsorts, demonstrating the distorted political times we live in. It could well buy her enough time to go back to Brussels and try to\u0026nbspsecure a further concession.It was also Mr Cameron who suffered the largest rebellion over Europe, when 81 of his MPs rebelled over EU policy in 2011 – a key moment in that prime minister’s eventual decision in 2013 to allow a referendum.The largest defeat Margaret Thatcher faced was when 72 MPs refused to back her changes to Sunday trading laws as she sought to liberalise the UK’s economy. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Sixth formers and college students across the country only have 24 hours to send off their university applications for September – and without any exam results, the process can be pretty daunting.Most universities in England, Northern Ireland and Wales currently base their offers to prospective undergraduates on personal statements, predicted grades and references. \u0026nbspBut many in the sector believe the admissions system needs to be overhauled. The University and College Union (UCU) says students should apply to university after they get their results. \u0026nbspMore students starting degrees in January to get head start with jobsThe start of university courses could in that scenario shift to November to ensure that applications can only be made once students have their A-level or BTEC results, the union argues.This is not the first time\u0026nbsppost-qualification admissions (PQA) in the UK have been called for and it will doubtless not be the last. The sharp rise in unconditional offers being made to students before they take their exams has brought the issue back to the fore.More than one in three students who applied to university were offered a place on a course regardless of their actual A-Level or BTEC\u0026nbspgrades, recent Ucas figures show,\u0026nbspprompting\u0026nbspfears that standards could drop in universities and students could become demotivated in their final school year.A move to PQA would eliminate these risks, say supporters. The Association of School and College Leaders has also called for the system to be brought in line with the rest of the world.A study by UCU last year, which looked at different university admissions system in 30 major countries, found that no other country uses predicted grades to award university places.A change would also remove the higher education sector’s dependency on unreliable predicted grades made by teachers, which Labour and social mobility charity Sutton Trust say can underestimate the ability of disadvantaged students in particular.On the other hand, Ucas‘s chief executive, Clare Marchant, believes moving to a post-qualification admissions system could disadvantage\u0026nbspvulnerable pupils as they would be forced into making a decision over a short period without support from\u0026nbsptheir teachers, in the months after they have left school.The other argument against\u0026nbspchanging the status quo\u0026nbspis that universities would have insufficient time to consider a candidate’s all-round potential – and instead it could put a narrower focus on exam results.A major overhaul of the system would also bring significant upheaval to the admissions cycle at a time when school, colleges and universities already face a series of reforms and challenges.The sector is ided but the calls for change keep coming. It will be interesting to see whether the new universities minister, Chris Skidmore, wades into the debate in the upcoming months.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was possible to buy its handsets for some time if you looked hard enough, its first official move into the UK came last November with a highly attractive, innovative phone called the Mi 8 Pro.This week, its second flagship phone goes on sale, the Mi Mix 3, and it’s even more eye-catching. It’s a slider phone. No, not like those tiddly Samsung feature phones from the nineties, this phone slides only about 1cm, enough to reveal the camera hidden behind. Which, in turn, means the phone\u0027s front really is all screen –\u0026nbspwell, technically it has a 93.4 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Unlike other full-screen phones, there’s no notch because there’s no need to find room for the camera.I spoke to Xiang Wang, the company’s global senior vice president and head of\u0026nbspinternational business. We met at the Barbican Centre in London and sat in a corner that defined the eccentricity of the building, with sloping floors and corridors that narrow unexpectedly.

We were struggling to pick which one because we have so many,” Wang said.The new phone, the Mi Mix 3, was also a contender for being the first UK release. “It is another high-end model with a good camera, strong battery, new stuff inside. In the end, we went for the Mi 8 Pro because of its design with its cool transparent back, in-screen fingerprint sensor and so on. So, I think the UK audience may like it. We are also releasing a scooter, we think we picked the best, coolest products we have for the UK market.”Yes, that’s right, Xiaomi also makes an electric scooter. The range available in the UK includes half a dozen phones, a fitness tracker, a nightlight and a couple of power banks, but in China the products available are much more numerous. The plan is to offer a much wider range here, too, one day.“Through the Xiaomi stores we want to learn what the British consumer wants and needs so we can bring the right products to the UK. Now, we have just brought the hot-selling products from China and elsewhere because it takes time for us to do the testing and certification for the local requirements of each market. We think that in the future when we have a bigger customer base, we will have a better idea of what works for each country.”Xiang Wang, Xiaomi\u0027s global senior vice president and head of international business (Xiaomi)So, why is Xiaomi building its presence now in the UK? “I think the rationale is this. On 7 November\u0026nbsp2017 we had our first launch event in the western world, in Madrid, Spain. We tested the market and now we are number three in Spain. We work with all channel partners including online and offline carriers, including building our own Xiaomi stores there. The initial success in Spain gave us much more confidence for the western European markets. These are developed markets in which we had never worked before. Last May we launched our pilot service in France and Italy, in Milan and Paris and so the next natural step was the UK.”This may lead to different challenges, it seems. “The UK has a lot of technology innovations, plus art, fashion, and an energised younger generation. I think this could be a good place for us. There are also a lot of challenges in the UK because the normal consumer doesn’t know us. Those who do know us are engineers and the younger generation who have come across us on the internet. Also, in the smartphone world, the UK is still a carrier market, so we have to spend extra effort to make customisations for carriers. That’s another challenge. Overall we’re very confident.”When I met a senior executive at Huawei a year ago, he said it would be easy for the brand to be the world’s number one (it’s already climbed to number two, overtaking Apple in recent months, leaving only Samsung ahead of it). But that wasn’t the most important thing. What would be Wang’s ambition for Xiaomi?“Our ambition is not to become the number one smartphone hardware company – we definitely want to be one of the important and biggest tech companies in the world. But our aim is not just selling hardware, we are much more than a smartphone company. We build more products than that.”One of the standout features of the brand is the competitive price: Both the new Mi Mix 3 and the Mi 8 Pro are priced at £499, half the price of an iPhone XS. How is the company making the phone for that price?“Internally we are making huge efforts to improve operating efficiency. Actually, unlike traditional hardware companies, we do not spend huge sums of money on traditional marketing and billboards. We use social media and other channels to communicate our products. Basically, it’s word of mouth. If someone loves our products, they will tell their friends, family colleagues.”From 2018 the company set a maximum profit level of 5 per cent. If profit exceeds this, Xiaomi has said they will return the excess to consumers. “Yes, we did this already, last year. We gave coupons to our consumers which they can use to buy our products. That’s one way, which we did last year for Chinese consumers.”Xiaomi expects the range to grow in the UK, but Wang points out that there’s already something for every pocket.“Actually, we have the whole portfolio from the entry-level to flagship covered. We will gradually bring more but we understand we need to be focused, Wang said. The UK market is very different from others, there are still a lot of entry-level products but the high-end part of the market is very big. The phone network Three has been asking us to offer better entry-level products and we are doing that.In the mid-range we want to understand it better, we’ll listen to the carriers more.”It sounds like the company will see what works in China first, to get a clue as to what will work here in the UK. But Wang reveals that this may some day lead to products tailor-made for British tastes. “In the long run, once we have built more resources, we can think about products which can be designed specifically for the UK or Europe. But now we basically pick products from our portfolio. We have to do some customisation, for example the frequency requirements are a little different, so we have to add a band to serve European consumers.”This is now the fastest-selling smartphone in India- everSmartphone shake-up amid Samsung wobbles and the rise of XiaomiEvery phone manufacturer faces a challenge. Handsets have just become the same thing – a black oblong with a glass or metal back. How does Xiaomi differentiate?“The Mi Mix 3 is one way to stand out from the crowd. The competition is severe so we are competing on every front, for instance, design and material – the Mi Mix series was the first to use ceramic, as a unibody, the entire phone was built from one piece of ceramic, including the frame. That’s another choice. As for technology, we always partner with the best, for items such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor.”This is in the Mi 8 Pro, but not the new Mi Mix 3 which has a conventional rear-mounted sensor.Finally, how does he view competition?“I think competition is good – if everything is the same and we have efficiency, the cost advantage, from making it in China in large numbers, then we don’t need to make a lot of profit from the hardware.

There are fears Amaral plans a follow-up."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict0003192694671.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"portugal madeleine mccann ocean club praia da luz","story":"The three-year-olds disappearance remains one of the most well known missing person cases in British history.Little Maddie, then three, disappeared from her bed in a holiday apartment in Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal.The McCanns arrived on Saturday, April , , for a seven-night spring break at the two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment.It was in the fth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village.But on the evening of May , she vanished from the apartment where she had been sleeping with her brother and sister. Her parents were at a nearby restaurant.It was due to be the penultimate day of the McCann family holiday.The apartment is on the edge of travel firm Mark Warners Ocean Club resort.The Ocean Club is one of several tourist sites in the popular holiday town.It is located close to the larger town of Lagos, about an hours drive from Faro airport.In February  the apartment was sold to a British gran for £, – half the asking price.Police have recorded thousands of potential sightings of missing Maddie since . Madeleine vanished on May , , when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in the Algarve, Portugal.Parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a nearby tapas bar.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed.In September of that year Gerry and Kate were named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.While arguido is often translated as ‘suspect’, it actually means a person being questioned under caution.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.In , Maddie’s distraught parents met with then-home secretary Theresa May to talk about the hunt for their daughter.The following year, Scotland Yard launched its own review, named Operation Grange, into the case at the behest of the future PM.Two years later Scotland Yard said it had uncovered new leads while Portuguese police reopened their case.In October , Operation Grange was scaled down from  detectives to just four.Last December, the Tory government injected extra funding into the operation as cops investigated a new theory that Maddie was snatched by a human trafficking ring.In October, cops said they were now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation.And a former Met police chief called for a fresh interview of Maddies parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.In November  it emerged a new line of enquiry saw cops travel to Bulgaria to try and track down a paedophiles widow.In March , Scotland Yard won Home Office funding to continue chasing a vital final line of enquiry for a further six months.Following the conclusion of that six-month period, Scotland Yard made a formal request to the Home Office for a further six months of funding.Maddie turned  on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer-generated image of Maddie showing what she would look like aged nine.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none have amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In January , Maddies parents were boosted by the news that -year-old American schoolgirl Jayme Closs had been found three months after her kidnap.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she was upset or tired she had Cuddle Cat.It was special to her so it is special to me.She carried it around so much that her other daughter Amelie would often make references to the toy.Kate said: Amelie will point at Cuddle Cat and say Madeleine, her Cuddle Cat, looking after it.Shes probably heard me saying that.A controversial TV drama about the fake kidnap of Shannon Matthews faced criticism for being insensitive when it featured mother Karen Matthews clutching a toy before cameras, mimicking Kate.Irish journalist Brenda Woods, one of the first reporters to meet the McCanns after Maddie vanished, recalled that Kate said pray for us while holding her hands in mine, and holding Cuddle Cat alongside.Potential sightings of the three-year old followed up by British cops total , across  countries and territories, a Freedom of Information request by The Sun showed in October.In January , Maddies parents were boosted by the news that -year-old American schoolgirl Jayme Closs had been found three months after her kidnap.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is going to be very hard”.The biggest Commons defeat on record was by a majority of , against the minority Labour government in .The largest post-war defeat was by , on the Callaghan minority Government in .Meanwhile, Business Secretary Greg Clark became the most senior Tory to publicly break ranks and call on all MPs to make fresh compromises for a softer Brexit deal yesterday.As the PM’s authority continues to collapse, the Cabinet minister appeared to have already dismissed any hope of the PM winning the key vote next Tuesday.Instead, Mr Clark branded no deal “a disaster” and WTO terms “a dire prospect”.And he called on Parliament to “move quickly and act responsibly”.He added: “Parliament needs to recognise we need to put dferences aside. I hope colleagues in the days ahead will recognise our collective responsibility to get a deal”.No refused to slap down Mr Clark, in a sign of the PM’s weakness, but said “disaster” was not a word the PM would use.The DUP, whose  MPs the PM relies on to prop up her minority government, also kept up their hard line.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cave in to Remainers further, for example over a permanent customs union tying us to the EU forever, and the Government is kaput.The PM’s only solution after defeat on Tuesday is toimmediately to Brussels, preferably with DUP chief Arlene Foster, and tell the EU it’s now or never for a legally-binding assurance on the Irish backstop.It should be enough for the DUP and maybe Tory eurosceptics faced with the real threat of Brexit never happening.Here’s a stark reminder for delusional Cabinet europhiles:When they triggered Article  they voted for the possibility of No Deal, however unpalatable they now consider it. They also backed a binding referendum and a Tory manesto promising to leave the single market and customs union.And they should remember this: their own anti-Brexit prejudices do not matter a damn. What DOES is the Leave verdict of the .million majority and most Tory voters and members.If this Remainer-stuffed Government nullies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party.They will have gted everything, our economy and our national security, to Corbyn’s anti-western Marxist rabble. Britain will never forgive them.OUR economy may be slowing a little . . . but the eurozone is in meltdown.Germany, its powerhouse, is close to recession. Italy is almost certainly there already. France is struggling.

I don’t want any written advice or advice of any kind at all.I’ve made my decision and I will stick to that.’”When the meeting broke up, the Speaker held the clerk back and he finally told him why he would be breaking centuries of precedent by allowing Tory rebel Dominic Grieve to table an amendment on a government motion.Another source said: “He tried more than once to explain why he was wrong but the Speaker told him he was not interested in what a gaggle of clerks had to say.“He finally managed to get part of his message across in private and handed over a note he had written from which he had quoted one or two points to help the Speaker deal with any questions he may get. But that note was taken away and destroyed.”Furious MPs have accused Mr Bercow of trying to scupper Brexit by allowing the controversial vote against the advice of his officials.He has turned down their requests to reveal the advice he was given by senior aides.One Tory said: “The question has to be asked why the Speaker will not publish the advice he received to when he ordered the Attorney General to make public the confidential advice he gave to the government on Brexit.”A spokesman for the Speaker’s office said: “Any meetings the Speaker has with the clerks are private and we never ulge what was discussed.”It also emerged that Mr Bercow secretly met Tory rebel Dominic Grieve a day before the Brexit rumpus.The pair spoke in the Speaker’s grace-and-favour Commons residence, sparking angry accusations of a “stitch up” over the extraordinary events.Mr Grieve refused to reveal what he had discussed with Mr Bercow but insisted: “Speakers make up their own minds.”We reveal today he binned a paper from his most senior official, David Natzler, when he tried to discuss Mr Bercow’s controversial Commons amendment.The Speaker shamelessly ignored the very Parliamentary conventions he is there to uphold so he could skew the Brexit debate in favour of Remainers — damaging the impartiality of his office.Mr Bercow has a B******s to Brexit sticker on the family car.Isn’t it time to say B******s to Bercow Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which leader Jeremy Corbyn has threatened to do.The Leader of the Opposition would have to table a motion that “That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government”.MPs then vote, with a simple majority needed to succeed.On the Andrew Marr show, Corbyn promised that Labour would call a no confidence motion soon, but has refused to comment on whether that would be as a reaction to Mays Brexit plan."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000461791651-e1547491791128.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"costa del sol boy down well malaga","story":"The youngster, named only as Yulen, disappeared after plunging down the tiny -inch wide hole as his family were cooking with friends.One relative has told police they heard the boy crying seconds after he vanished.Emergency services have been working throughout the night at the country property near the Costa del Sol capital of Malaga to try to reach the youngster.A camera lowered into the well has failed to capture any sound or images indicatingthe boy is dead or alive, although a blockage which is thought to be a small landslide has been spotted ft down.A bag of sweets Yulen was carrying -

as Labour forecasts a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister.Winding up the debate for the Government, Lord Keen of Elie urged MPs to back Mrs Mays deal, warning the alternatives were worse and Parliament must respect the result of the referendum.Lord Keen said a second referendum would be seen by some as a constitutional outrage, and insisted the  referendum was a peoples vote.For Labour, Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town condemned the political declaration as a dismally inadequate means of ensuring the UKs future relationship with the EU.Lady Hayter said the Prime Minister had wasted two years negotiating with her own party and put blinkered Brexiteers in charge, who rejected all evidence at iance with their ideological obsession.Labours alternative was a customs union, she insisted.Liberal Democrat Baroness Ludford said the country had been held to ransom by squabbling in the Conservative party and hoped that in a peoples vote the British people would choose to remain in the EU.Nothing can be as good as EU membership, she told a packed chamber after more than  peers had taken part in the debate.Earlier, the deal was branded a terrible shambles by former chairman of the Conservative Party Lord Patten of Barnes.Lord Patten warned that arguments over the EU were set to pollute British politics for a long time to come, eventhe deal was agreed to in tomorrows crunch Commons vote.He also warned of collateral damage to both the Tories and the country over Brexit and urged MPs to limit the damage in a way that did not make Britain poorer or less influential in the world.Yesterday, a treasury minister was snapped leaving a high level government meeting today carrying a sheet of paper bearing extraordinary warnings of “no food” under a no deal Brexit.Top Tory Mel Stride’s notes -

in a sign that she could be preparing to make huge moves later this week.She would only tell Tory MP Bill Cash that leaving the EU on March  is “our intent” and “what the Government is working for”.The gambit is unlikely to be enough to stop MPs voting down the deal in Parliament tomorrow.Speaking to the House of Commons this evening, Mrs May asked her critics to reconsider as she talked up the risks of No Deal.The PM said: What would a No Deal Brexit do to strengthen the hand of those campaigning for Scottish independence - or indeed those demanding a border poll in Northern Ireland Surely this is the real threat to our Union.And , rather than leaving with No Deal, this house blocked Brexit, that would be a subversion of our democracy, saying to the people we were elected to serve that we were unwilling to do what they had instructed.So I say to members on all sides of this house – whatever you may have previously concluded – over these next  hours, give this deal a second look.She insisted that when the history books are written those who back her deal will be proven to be in the right.Responding, Jeremy Corbyn blasted: I am sure honourable members across the house will not be fooled by what has been produced today. It is clear what we are voting on this week is exactly the same deal we should have voted on in December.I am sure the Prime Minister knows this – that is why today she is trying to blame others for this chaos.And Brexiteer Tory Mark Francois blasted the EU letter as a fig leaf and a small fig leaf at that.The letter sent by Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker to Mrs May declares that the backstop - designed to stop a hard border in Ireland - would be a bad outcome for both sides.And it insists that the mechanism is not designed to trap Britain in the EU customs union, or carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.But the letter stops short of declaring that Britain and Europe will definitely strike a trade deal by the end of  which would make the backstop unnecessary.That means it may fail to win over Tory MPs worried that the backstop would leave the UK permanently tied to Brussels and unable to set our own trade policy.Mrs May said during a speech in Stoke-on-Trent earlier today: I pursued a proposal for a fixed date - with legal force - guaranteeing the point at which the future partnership would come into force.The EU’s position was that - while they never want or expect the backstop to come into force - a legal time limit was not possible.I fully understand that the new legal and political assurances which are contained in the letters from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker do not go as far as some MPs would like.In their letter, Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker wrote: The commission can confirm that, just like the United Kingdom, the European Union does not wish to see the backstop enter into force. Were it to do so, it would represent a suboptimal trading arrangement for both sides.The Commission can also confirm the European Union’s determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that would ensure the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.The top Eurocrats said thatMPs back the withdrawal agreement tomorrow, the EU will sign it immediately - allowing talks on the future trade deal to start as soon as this week.They said the talks would prioritise finding a hi-tech solution to the Irish border, using smart technology to avoid any checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And they added thatthe backstop did come into effect, Britain and the EU would hold a summit every six months to find a way to end it while Northern Ireland would get a veto on any new laws coming from Brussels while the arrangement was in force.The backstop would see the UK stay in Europes customs union until an alternative way of keeping the Irish border is agreed - meaning Britain would have no choice but to accept EU rules on trade and customs arrangements.Critics blasted the exchange of letters as nothing more than a fig leaf which doesnt change the facts of the deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: The Prime Minister has once again failed to deliver. This is a long way from the signicant and legally effective commitment the Prime Minister promised last month.Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of Mrs Mays DUP allies, added: Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns.Instead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.Brexiteer Will Quince, who quit the Government over the deal, said: This letter from the EU, welcome as it is, does not offer legally binding assurances on the backstop. Therefore my position remains unchanged and I will not be voting for the withdrawal agreement as it stands.In the past  hours half a dozen MPs from both main parties have announced they are backing Mrs Mays deal when it comes to a vote tomorrow night.But she is still thought to be on course for a heavy defeat - meaning shell have to unveil a Plan B within days.In her Stoke speech this morning, Mrs May claimed thather deal is voted down, Britain will be on course to stay in the EU for good.She said: As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so.“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy.“People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.”Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC: I think No Deal would damage our economy - Ive been frank about that - but I think its survivable. I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover.This evening the House of Commons will resume its debate on the withdrawal agreement which started last week.The debate will be opened by Dr Fox, and closed late tonight by Chancellor Philip Hammond.Tomorrow will be the final day of debate, followed by the vote around pm.If Mrs May loses the vote she will have three working days toto the Commons and announce what her alternative course of action is.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell today said Labour would launch a bid to unseat the GovernmentMrs May loses the vote on her deal.Asked about the timing of a no-confidence vote, he said: Its just a matter of timing so watch this space over the next  hours.Labours Tulip Siddiq was advised by doctors she should have a caesarean section today or tomorrow.But shes moved the date to Thursday because she was worried about missing the big Commons vote.Ms Siddiq, a diehard Remainer, told the Evening Standard she was intent on voting down the PMs deal.If my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised, but it’s a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between Britain and Europe, then that’s worth fighting for.This is a high risk pregnancy and I am doing this against doctor’s advice.Ms Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead  Kilburn, had a dficult time giving birth to her first child

more leverage over the UK in the next round of talks.The revelations come from diplomatic minutes of a presentation by Commission officials in November to address Member State concerns over the deal.They say that:EU capitals were especially worried about the UK-wide backstop, which they saw as a concession that surrendered vital leverage in future trade talks.But eurocrats insisted they had got a good deal by getting Britain to tie its hands over following EU rules before negotiations have even begun on an FTA.The note says: The Commission says that what the UK has accepted in terms of the Level Playing Field has never been adopted in an FTA before.Its without precedent when it comes to dynamic alignment, dispute settlement and the possibility to issue autonomous measures in case of non-compliance.Moreover, the outline of the political declaration makes it explicit that the future Level Playing Field must build on these Level Playing Field aspects.At the meeting, which took place the week before leaders signed off on the deal, eurocrats also reassured EU ambassadors over the role of euro judges.According to the note they admitted making a limited concession on the ECJ, whose remit in the withdrawal pact only extends to policing areas of EU law.But they add the governance model will form the basis for the future relationship, raising the spectre of an ongoing role for the court in British affairs.Eurocrats told capitals they cant be forced to sign a trade deal with the UK despite a best endeavours clause to negotiate one as quickly as possible.They said the arbitration  set up to police the deal can never impose decisions on Member States by making them agree to an FTA.But they warned warned fines could be issued or parts of the deal revokedcapitals breach the terms

never accept current EU quotas and that the deal means current arrangements wont change until at least .The note says: The UK is just as unhappy as the fishery member states, which makes the Commission conclude it did the right thing.Elsewhere, the dossier details how there will still be checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain under the backstop.But eurocrats dont want to spell

And yes it is a compromise”.She added: “When the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask: did we deliver on the country’s vote to leave the European Union ”But she also angered Brexiteers by refusing to categorically rule out delaying Brexit yesterday despite repeated pleas to.It also emerged last night that EU diplomats in Brussels have also began discussions about how to tweak the Political Declaration that accompanies the orce deal to make it more palatable to MPs.Leaders are also looking at calling a new emergency Brexit summit soon.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox became the first senior minister to admit the prospect of defeat, saying: “I think it’s unlikely we will win the vote tomorrow to be frank”.Parliament will be besieged today by supporters and opponents of Brexit.Hundreds of extra police have been drafted in to keep the peace as tensions soar.The People’s Vote campaign will screen the debate and vote live from Parliament Square, which it has booked for the whole evening from pm.Pro-second referendum MPs will also address the crowd. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear. Poor Coleen, she’s got five children not four.How tiresome.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos. Everywhere.I do hope Olivia wins Best Actress for The Favourite at the Academy Awards. When she has an Oscar, fewer people will be able to afford her.LOOKING just like one of the “gilets jaunes” – yellow vests – who rampage up and down the Champs-Elysees every weekend, Bella Hadid wears a hi-vis sleeveless jacket.Apparently, Bella’s yellow vest cost £. She should protest about that.IT was a relief to hear from Olivia Newton-John that she is not at death’s door as has ly been reported, but is alive, kicking and feeling good.Apparently, the confusion arose when it started getting about that the star of Grease had gone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

Mel Stride, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, was photographed outside the Cabinet Office with the document protruding from a red folder. Political photographer Steve Back took the photo after Mr Stride attended a Brexit planning meeting with Treasury officials. Mr Stride is the latest in a long line of Tory ministers and officials to be caught by Mr Back flashing documents that should be private. Last month chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins was snapped with private documents on Britains plan for the Northern Ireland border.  And documents on No Deal planning scenario Operation Yellowhammer were revealed by bungling minister John Glen in September. But unlike previous examples, which were scrawled and fuzzy, todays notes were completely legible and protruding perfectly from the folder. That led to instant speculation that it was a deliberate stunt to scare MPs into backing Theresa Mays Brexit deal tomorrow night. Journalists tweeted call me cynical but it definitely looks like that piece of paper has been deliberately pulled out and it has to be a set-up . Tory Brexiteer MP Michael Fabricant scoffed: If ever there were a set up photo, this is one!! Desperate stuff. MPs were set to vote down the Brexit deal by more than  - making it the biggest defeat of a government since the Second World War. Thats according to Prof Philip Cowley of Queen Mary University London, who analysed more than a century of votes in the Commons. Prof Cowley - who wrote the book on the  general election - analysed all meaningful defeats of the government in the Commons. That meant excluding surprise ambush votes, free votes and votes the government chose deliberately not to fight. According to the academic, a government has only been defeated by more than  votes in the Commons three times in the last century, and all of them were in . The minority Labour government suffered defeats by ,  and  votes. Since the Second World War, the biggest meaningful defeats of a government were by  and  votes, in  and  respectively, he said. The biggest rebellion of modern politics was set in  when  Labour MPs rebelled against Tony Blair over the Iraq War. The biggest ever Tory rebellion was in  when  Conservatives rebelled over post-Dunblane gun control under John Major.  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: This looks just a bit too obvious - the last desperate throw of the dice by a government that has lost the argument on Brexit. The sooner tomorrow’s vote is out the way, the better - then we can get on with finding a better way forward. Labour MP Jo Stevens of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain campaign said: The government clearly know the harm a no deal Brexit would cause, so its shameful theyre still using the no deal threat to scare MPs into backing the Prime Ministers bad deal. Shes basically trying to hold the people of this country to ransom in order to stay in power.  Some on Twitter mocked the apparent gaffe. Journalist Katie Martin wrote: New version of Imagine sounds rubbish. Colleague Henry Mance added: Bob Marleys first draft. Others Photoshopped Tory minister Liam Foxs desperate defence of No Deal onto the document - such as It wont be national suicide and Not as bad as Dunkirk.   The -page Brexit deal, which ensures EU rules continue without a clf-edge to December , is set to be defeated by more than  votes at pm tomorrow - the heaviest Commons loss since the Second World War. EU leaders today issued a clarication in which they insisted a backstop clause, which could trap the UK under EU customs rules, will be temporary. But Brexiteer Tories, Labour and Theresa Mays DUP allies blasted the offer because it made no legal change to the Brexit deal itself. A Whitehall source insisted the notes were Mr Strides personal notes on topics he wanted to raise at the meeting, and not official government documents. The source added: Its not a set-up.

The Speaker will announce this morning which he has picked. The limit of six has been lted. Each amendment to the vote - known as a ision - can last about  minutes. Downing Street is preparing for a big rebellion with sources suggesting more than  Tory MPs could vote against. But the big unknown is what happens next. Theresa Mays Plan B  Whatever the result the PM is expected to make a statement straight after the result setting out what she plans to do next. There are suggestions the Government could ask MPs to vote on the same deal again at a later date.No  hopes that the pressure of a fast approaching Brexit day and a lack of an alternative plan will focus MPs’ minds.Parliamentary rules usually prevent the Government asking MPs to vote on the same question butit tweaks the wording it could get away with it. Brussels sources suggest they want to see how the vote goes before they offer more compromises.  Downing Street has indicated it will accept one amendment, proposed by Tory MP Hugo Swire. This supports the PM’s deal but would give MPs a future vote to approve the implementation of the Northern Ireland backstop. It includes six conditions on the “insurance policy” to avoid a hard border, after the PM said Government was looking at ways to make sure the backstop has “democratic legitimacy”. But questions remain over whether these commitments would breach the UK’s international obligations to the EU. Tory MPs Andrew Murrison and Sir Edward Leigh have tabled other amendments which would put a time limit on the backstop. Their plan is to reduce the scale of a Government defeat, although the PM has conceded that Brussels wouldn’t go for it. MPs take control  Three Tory former ministers led by Nick Boles have said a senior  of MPs - the liaison committee - should be given responsibility to come up with their own compromise deal. He has denied the move was a “coup” but admitted it would see power handed to the liaison committee, chaired by second referendum backer Sarah Wollaston, to find a way forward. But Wollaston has complained that the liaison committee was not consulted by the plan and No  has warned against it.What time is the Brexit vote  Parliament to vote on Theresa Mays EU deal today Jeremy Corbyns plan The Labour frontbench amendment rejects the PM’s deal because it fails to meet its “six tests” on Brexit.The party has also rejected leaving without a deal and has promised to “pursue every option” to avoid either of those outcomes. However, Mr Corbyn and his top team have repeatedly stated they want to force a general election, and would table a no confidence vote in the Government at the moment they believe they are most likely to win. Several shadow cabinet ministers have suggested this could be immediately after a defeat, although without the DUP abstaining they are unlikely to win. Mays deal - and no Brexit kicked out  Senior Labour MP Hilary Benn has tabled an amendment that both rejects the PM’s plan and also the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.The chair of the Brexit committee has won cross-party support from MPs campaigning for a second referendum, including leading Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, SNP MPs and senior Labour backbenchers like Yvette Cooper.This boosts the amendment’s chances of being selected, although Mr Benn is said to have come under pressure to withdraw as some Tory MPs oppose leaving without a deal, but still want to support the PM. Brexit delayed  The SNP and Plaid Cymru have warned that the PM’s Brexit deal would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the UK as a whole. They argue that the UK’s departure from the EU should be delayed until another withdrawal deal is agreed with the UK. This would involve the Government delaying or revoking article  to delay Brexit Day beyond March , something it would be unwilling to do unless its hand was forced by MPs. Any delay would also require the agreement of the EU, which has made it clear it would not agree just for more negotiations. Second referendum  The Lib Dems have called on the Government to prepare for a “People’s Vote” in which the public would get a fresh public vote. But the official People’s Vote campaign called the move “clearly unhelpful” as it would come too soon to have any realistic hope of success. The amendment does not have cross-party support which suggests it may not be picked by the Speaker. Many second referendum campaigners believe that the option should be put on the table as last resort - and once every other option has been defeated -it is to get the backing of enough MPs. Workers rights protections  This amendment, tabled by Labour backbencher John Mann, supports the PM’s deal on condition the government maintains standards in employment, environmental protection and health and safety. It has the backing of six Labour MPs but the unions and the party leadership have opposed it, arguing that it would not be legally binding.Theresa May met with a handful of Labour MPs over Christmas, most who represent Leave-voting constituencies, in a bid to win their support for her deal.So far four Labour MPs have said they will vote for the Government’s Brexit plan.

James Blake, the man behind Emergency Food Storage UK, says his firm has already sold  of the terrying rations.

Its just being that little bit more prepared and having that little bit more wiggle room.   A government spokesperson said: “People dont need to stockpile food, water filters or fire starters. The UK has a strong level of food security built upon a erse range of sources including strong domestic production and imports from third countries.

Bassetlaw MP John Mann told the Mirror that the amendment would make Mrs May’s deal “more attractive” and tackle key Labour concerns. Caroline Flint, MP for Don Valley, added: “Given the government cannot rely on the hard Brexiteers on their side, they have to reach out across the House to Labour.”   But speaking at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn claimed her bid to woo wavering Labour MPs had failed.He said: “ Theresa May ’s deal is a bad deal for our country. It fails to meet the needs of millions of our constituents facing deep insecurity and stress from a lack of good jobs, inadequate housing and chronic under-investment in their communities and futures.“Theresa May has attempted to blackmail Labour MPs to vote for her botched deal by threatening the country with the chaos of No Deal. I know from conversations with colleagues that this has failed. The Labour party will not be held to ransom.   He added: “When the Prime Minister’s deal is defeated, she will only have herself to blame. She has spent two years negotiating with her cabinet and her bickering backbenchers instead of the EU, shutting out trade unions, businesses and parliament from the process. “The Tory Party’s botched deal will be rejected by Parliament. We will then need an election to have the chance to vote for a government that can bring our people together and address the deep-seated issues facing our country.” Speaking after the meeting, a Labour source said the meeting was extremely calm and supportiveAsked about Labours plan for Brexit, they said: The conference composite identies the Peoples Vote as one of the options it doesnt say its the preferred option or the default optionwe cant get a general election.It says the best outcome is a general election and then all options are on the table.

More than  Conservative MPs are expect to inflict a crushing blow on the Prime Minister’ by finally rejecting her Brexit plans. The devastating defeat would throw the Government - and the country - into unprecedented uncertainty. Mrs May is expected to make an immediate statement on her Plan B in the minutes following the voteher deal falls. Her RAF plane is on standby should she decide to fly straight out to Brussels to beg for yet more concessions to her deal. But her premiership now hangs in the balance with all eyes on when Labour will choose to table a no confidence vote in her Government. Downing Street sources did not even rule out the PM quitting after a defeat. Today, the desperate PM gave one final roll of the dice, warning that no Brexit at all was the “more likely” outcomeher deal is defeated.   In a last-ditch attempt to lure Brexiteers into backing her, she claimed that rejecting her plan could even break up the UK. But she was on course for a potentially terminal defeat after attempts to get Brussels to to provide more reassurances for sceptical MPs falls flat. The DUP’s Nigel Dodds warned that far from reassuring his party over the controversial Irish backstop, letters from EU chiefs had heightened their concerns. “There is nothing new. Nothing has changed. Instead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement.” he said. Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg added: “Only change to the withdrawal agreement matters.” Jeremy Corbyn dismissed the letter from eurocrats Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker as “warm words and aspirations” which fell short of legal assurances. “I’m sure members across the House will not be fooled by what has been produced today,” he said. It came after the PM conceded she “fully understood” the compromises would not go far enough for some MPs. She confirmed the EU had rejected her demand to set a fixed end date for the backstop.  But Mrs May begged more than  Tory MPs who have already ruled out backing her deal to give it a second chance. “Give this deal a second look,” she implored them. “No, it’s not perfect and yes it’s a compromise. But when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of the House tomorrow and ask: did we deliver on the country’s vote to leave the European Union. “Did we safeguard our our economy, our security and our union  Or did we let the British people down.” A furious Mr Corbyn accused the PM of undermining public faith in politics. “The Government is in disarray. It’s clear,the Prime Minister’s deal is rejected, it’s time for a general election, it’s time for a new Government,” he added. In a speech in a factory in Stoke, Mrs May claimed the UK would eventually make a success of leaving without a deal, though she admitted it would cause “signicant disruption” first. And she refused to explicitly rule out delaying Brexit Day or holding a second referendum.  “Look, we’re leaving on  March. I’ve been clear that I don’t believe we should be extending article  and I don’t believe we should be having a second referendum,” she said. It comes amid claims the EU was preparing to offer the Government a delay of Brexit until at least Julyher deal is quashed. The PM claimed some MPs had changed their minds on her deal. Four Tory switchers announced they would now back her deal, along with four Labour MPs. She suffered another blow when Tory whip and Brexiteer Gareth Johnson quit the Government so he could vote against the plans. But groups of MPs were working on their own Plan Bs - with Brexiteers believing that by blocking a deal they could enable a no deal Brexit on March . Trade secretary Liam Fox said: “I don’t regard no deal as national suicide. This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union.” Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who is voting against the plan, insisted: “We are in a stronger position than our detractors suggest.” But other cross-party groups, backed by Labour, have warned they will use Parliamentary procedure to try to stop that happening. Instead they will attempt to seize control back from the Government and give MPs a say on what happens next. One group said they would hand over control to a  of senior MPs. Others were attempting to pave the way for a new referendum. Two of the leading Tory rebels - former ministers Nick Boles and Dominic Grieve - denied they were launching “a coup” and said Parliament was simply expressing its will. But the PM’s spokesman said: “Clearly any attempt to prevent the Government from meeting all the legal conditions for an orderly exit at this moment of historic signicance is extremely concerning”. Meanwhile, No  sources downplayed the chances of the PM backing an amendment by Tory Andrew Murrison which could put an expiry date on the backstop. The Government has already thrown its weight behind one from Tory Hugo Swire which includes six conditions on the “insurance policy” to avoid a hard border. Labour MP Hilary Benn was coming under pressure to withdraw his amendment which could potentially deny MPs the chance to vote on Mrs May’s deal itself. MPs were waiting for Labour to declare when it would table its motion of no confidence. “The call will be made [on Tuesday] after that vote,” shadow chancellor John McDonnell said. However, the move has little chance of success unless the DUP, which props up the Tories’ fragile coalition, abstains or votes against. Meanwhile, GMB union chief Tim Roache called for a delay to article  to give more time to get the deal right - and then a second referendum on that deal. “It’s like trying to do your Christmas shopping at half past  on Christmas Eve - everyone will get a load of rubbish or you’ll be in bother for getting nothing at all. It’s a no win scenario, which is why we need to stop and take a breath,” he said.

They will have the opportunity to back Theresa May’s deal or seek to find a better way forward. The Mirror strongly urges them to do the latter. The turbulent Brexit debate has consumed the nation for more than two years. Energy that should have been spent on addressing our neglected public services, tackling regional inequality, ending the housing crisis and improving skills and education has been exhausted on the tortuous process of trying to engineer our EU departure. A nation that used to be at ease with itself has become bitter and distrustful. Rather than seek to celebrate the things we have in common we now turn too quickly to the issues that ide us. Little wonder many people are sick to the back teeth with the whole thing and just want it over.  This paper shares that frustration. But the ability to tackle the issues that matter depends on getting a Brexit resolution that satisfies most of the % who voted Leave and most of the % who backed Remain. And that will require those most British of virtues: compromise and pragmatism. If our politicians are willing to co-operate rather than conspire, reason rather than spread rancour, then there is a way forward that can unite our troubled land and secure our future prosperity. With reservations, the Mirror backed Remain because we feared the economic consequences of Brexit would hit our readers the hardest. The same argument applies today. We cannot endorse a Brexit deal that would mean less money for things such as public services, the welfare state and more housing. And that is why MPs should not be panicked into accepting Mrs May’s plan just because it is the only offer currently on the table. If you are going to live in a house for the next  years you would not snap up the first property to go on the market, especiallyit came with a surveyor’s report warning it could be uninhabitable within months.  That is what the Prime Minister is trying to sell us. Even with the last minute concessions, her deal offers no legally binding protections for workers’ rights and the environment. Hard won benefits – such as paid holidays, protection for agency workers and parental leave – that are so important to Mirror readers could all be put at risk. Mrs May is also gambling the UK’s prosperity on securing a trade deal with the EU that would be negotiated from a position of weakness. We would enter these trade talks having thrown away all our bargaining chips and with the EU able to veto any of our demands. We will have gone from sitting at the top table to living in a Brussels dog basket. The only option worse than Mrs May’s proposal is crashing out without a deal. Consider those who are in favour of a no deal – the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Sir John Redwood – and ask yourselfthey would ever be on your side. They may be rich enough to cope with the economic catastrophe that would ensue but others will be much less fortunate, especiallythey lose their job and find prices rising. If, as expected, Mrs May loses the vote today then it is time for Parliament to take control. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s preferred option is for a general election. While we would love to see Labour back in power, the parliamentary arithmetic suggests that this is unlikely to happen. And evenwe had another election there is a strong possibility it would result in another hung parliament that is no better placed to sort out this Brexit mess.   An alternative solution is to inflict a second referendum on a weary electorate. While this option remains on the table we should think carefully before embarking on a course that could further ide a country whose social fabric is already fraying at the edges. A far better course would be to honour the result of the  referendum in a way that would reflect the % to % result. By joining the European Free Trade Association alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein the UK can fulfil the obligation to leave in a way that causes the least economic damage. We would regain sovereignty over food and fisheries and would be no longer beholden to EU courts. Environmental protections and workers’ rights would be safeguarded. Anda customs arrangement could be agreed it would solve at a stroke the Irish border question. The Mirror is the first to accept that this option is flawed. We would still be in the single market, which means accepting freedom of movement, and we would still have to make a contribution to the EU budget – though substantially less than the amount we pay at the moment. However, as a member of EFTA we would be allowed to impose an emergency brake on immigration should it be shown to be causing social or economic problems. The people who are concerned about the level of migration should remember EU nationals only make up a third of those coming to this country each year, and we already have measures in place to prevent benefit tourism.   We respect those readers who will hold dferent views. We understand those who want a clean Brexit and we sympathise with those who would dearly love to see us remain in the EU. There is, ultimately, no perfect Brexit. It is impossible to find a solution which will satisfy everyone. Whichever course we take will require concessions and cause disappointment. Having found ourselves in such a predicament we should pursue the least damaging outcome. In our view, that means a sovereign UK remaining in the single market while free from EU control. Only then can we move forward and start to address the problems that drove people to vote leave in the first place: the outrage over inequality the lack of opportunity entrenched regional ides the sense of being ignored by an out-of-touch political class and the lack of power to change their lives for the better. We all deserve a better future. We all deserve our voices to be heard. And that is exactly the cause we should all be fighting for.

Youve probably heard a lot about this mysterious backstop. But do you know what it means  We dont blame younot, as the whole thing has been testing our brains for months. In fact, its astonishing that the whole of Brexit has come down to boring technical jargon about customs arrangements. But we are where we are, and with a possible general election round the corner, its vital you know what the debate is about. Here is the issue explained.  The backstop is an insurance clause in the UKs -page Brexit deal with Brussels. If the deal is passed, EU rules continue until  December . But after that, its a big unknown. So the backstop guarantees checks do noton the -mile border between Northern Irelandand the Republic . This situation - known as a hard border - would set Irish peace back decades and could trigger ato violence of the Troubles. It would reverse the Good Friday Agreement pact that allows anyone to cross the border with little more than a sign and a dferent-coloured road.  Under the backstop, EU customs rules will be extended across the whole of the UK for a temporary period. This has infuriated Brexiteer MPs - who fear we will be a vassal state to Brussels, unable to sign trade deals around the world. It will kick in from  January no solution has been found for the Irish border. Britain has the option to extend the transition period for EU rules. Butit does kick in, it can only be ended by a joint committee - in other words, EU officials get a veto. Why is it making people angry  First off, the EU has refused to scrap the backstop - despite offering lots of clarications. That means there are still three main reasons why it is making Brexiteers, Remainers and the DUP angry.These reasons are important because MPs are now set to vote down the backstop - and therefore the entire deal - in the House of Commons.  The UK cannot sign its own trade deals with other countries, like Australia and Japan,it is in a customs union with the EU. This is why Theresa May was adamant the UK must leave the EU customs union. The backstop, however, will keep us in that customs union in all but name.  Britain tried again and again to set a time limit on the backstop, but it seems she was unsuccessful. First she wanted to set a firm end date of  December  - but the EU rejected it. . Then she wanted a mechanism for the UK to quit the backstop, no matter what Brussels says - but the EU rejected that too. Instead, there will be an independent committee to decidethe backstop can be terminated, with members from both the UK and EU. If this wasnt bad enough it could be overseen by the European Court of Justice - the exact body Theresa May is trying to leave.  A backstop would force some checks on trade Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies reject that - saying it breaks up the precious union of the UK.

But after the youngster complained of a sore tummy for a few nights in a row , the -year-old decided to take her to the doctors just in case.Medics initially thought Cayla was suffering from a urinary infection and gave her a course of antibiotics, but she continued to feel poorly.And after further appointments and tests, her parents were given the heartbreaking news that she had neuroblastoma that had spread to her lymph nodes.Courageous Cayla underwent eight rounds of chemotherapy in just  days, as well as surgery to remove the tumour, high-dose BuMel chemo and radiotherapy.   Now, her desperate family, from Collumpton, Devon, are fundraising for a vaccine treatment in the US to prevent relapse once their daughter reaches remission.All we want is to give our daughter the best chance at living a long, healthy le just like any other parent, says Enya, who also has a younger child, Finnley. It was last year that Cayla started to complain of nightly stomach aches.Her mum, who is partner to Brad Jones, , said: Cayla was fine in the daytime but when it was time to go to bed shed say she had a sore tummy. I thought she was just trying to get away with staying up later at first. But we wanted to get it checked out just in case, so I booked in for an appointment at our local GP. The GP didnt seem to think there was anything to worry about and said it may be a urine infection so he gave us a round of antibiotics and that was that. But after the week-long course of antibiotics was over last July, Cayla still felt ill.Enya said: I explained the antibiotics hadnt worked and we wondered what  it could be that was causing her stomach issues.   There had been a lot of change in Caylas le and I worried that that was causing her stress. Id just had my second baby, Finnley, earlier in the year and Cayla was preparing to start big school in September. He did a full check of her and when he got to her stomach said he could feel a mass and called another doctor for a second opinion. She added: They were throwing around words like hernia and appendix, but I still wasnt too concerned - it didnt sound like it would be anything too sinister. But then I caught sight of their faces - they both had a strange look about them and that was when I started to worry. The doctors gave Enya a letter to take to AE that meant they wouldnt need to wait - and Cayla was admitted to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital that day. The little girl underwent blood and urine tests and an ultrasound, before an oncologist called a worried Enya and Brad into a private room. Enya recalled: My heart sank. I heard them say theyd found a tumour and Brad and I both just broke down, we couldnt speak.   I couldnt even bring myself to ask any questions, I just tried to pull myself together and put a brave face on for Cayla so as not to scare her. And that attitude is something the mum has clung to throughout her familys devastating ordeal, staying strong for her daughters sake.She explained: I dont knowthere is a right way to act in that situation, we just had to do what was right for us and in that moment I knew she needed me to be calm. The family were transferred to Bristol Childrens Hospital a few days later, where Cayla underwent further scans and a biopsy of the tumour was carried out.And Enyas worst nightmare came true when the results came back.Her daughter was officially diagnosed with Stage Four neuroblastoma. She said: She had an MRI and NIBG scan to show where the disease was andit had travelled, and we saw that it had gone all the way up her diaphragm and into the lymph nodes in her neck. We were really lucky that it wasnt in her bones - which is usually the case with Stage Four - so that meant we didnt have to wait to clear out her bones before starting treatment.   Cayla started chemotherapy on July , undergoing eight rounds in  days. By the fourth round, the tumours in her neck had disappeared completely and the main tumour in her stomach had shrunk. Enya said: At the end of the  days her white blood cell count had flatlined and she had to be in isolation for three weeks because her immune system was so weak. It was really tough because we had the baby too, so trying to juggle everything was never easy, but we got through it. An MRI showed two thirds of the stomach tumour had disappeared.Cayla then underwent an eight-hour surgery to remove as much as possible, followed by a stem cell harvest - a procedure to obtain stem cells for use in cancer treatment. Enya said: She was in hospital in Bristol for two days and in the first day alone they got five million cells, which was amazing. When she got home from that she was so well - her appetite was better than before she was ill! It was lovely to see her like it. Cayla went through a further week of high dose Bumel chemotherapy - four times a day for six days, and then a final dose on the seventh day.   She was discharged on December  and will have scans later this month to seeshes in remission, before a final round of radiotherapy. Her parents are now fundraising to send her to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which offers a vaccine which can lower the chances of cancer coming back. So, far they have raised more than pound, of their pound, target with the help of the Bradley Lowery Foundation. Six-year-old Bradley tragically lost his fight with neuroblastoma last year, and his family are now helping other families to fundraise for treatment not available on the NHS. Enya said: When we first got the diagnosis, like everyone , I did the worst thing possible and went online. Aside from all the awful facts and statistics, I found information on the Center and the success rate was %. The odds of the cancer coming back in the first six months are   so the odds arent great so we started an online fundraiser soon after with the help of the Bradley Lowery Foundation. They have been such a huge help directing us with our fundraising, and the team there can completely relate to what were going through as theyve been through the same process.To donate to the familys cause, click here"},{"url":null,"title":"gran 71 who wed toyboy","story":"NewsGran, , who wed toyboy, , after meeting at sons funeral brags about romanceAlmeda Errell and Gary Hardwick, from Tennessee, have a -year age gap but their marriage thrives thanks to the little things they do for each other every dayShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video -year-old-who-wed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old gran who married a teenager after locking eyes on him at her sons funeral has bragged about their whirlwind romance.

Now almost three years on, the couple are still as in love as ever, with Almeda boasting about their great sex and affection for each other.  We are always complimenting and kissing, Almeda, from Maryville, Tennessee, said in a YouTube video. Were enjoying our relationship. When you meet that perfect one, thats when you know you dont want to lose that feeling. Almeda gushed about their regular date nights in which they eat out or go to the movies. She also admitted it is a stark contrast to her previous marriage where there wasnt a lot of romance or kissing and hugging. Almeda, a mum-of-four, was married to Donald for  years, but sadly he died in  from complications of diabetes.  As well as having to cope with being widowed, she was then dealt another blow when her eldest son Robert, , died following a seizure. It was at his funeral she met Gary - who is younger than one of Almedas grandsons. The pair instantly felt an attraction with Almeda drawn to Garys lovely smile. It was like a bright light through the grief, she previously said. Garys love of older women started with a crush on a teacher at the age of eight. He previously dated a -year-old but the romance soured because they were always bickering.  After the brief encounter at the funeral, the pair couldnt stop thinking about each other.They met again during a family birthday meal at a Chuck E Cheeses pizza restaurant and sparks flew.He was just as I remembered, said Almeda. That smile, those good looks. We were both too nervous to eat, and at one point he fell over his chair. But there was still one question Almeda needed to ask. She recalled: I just came out with it and said to him, Look, Im  and youre . Am I too old for you  He squeezed my hand, grinned, and replied: Age is just a number.   The pair then married weeks later - but not all of their family approved. Gary has since hit out at people who assume he married Almeda for money. He said: People talk with no sense. It really makes me mad people like to judge in that way.   And he added: Shes a cutie who makes me laugh all the time. Meanwhile Almeda gushed: In our relationship we do little things each day to help each other out whether he cooks me supper or mops for me. We always thank each other. Its the little things like that, cooking a meal, washing dishes.

Fighting back the tears, Jose Ragoobeer spoke of his fury at seeing Aram Kurd, , Hawkar Hassan, , and -year-old Arkan Ali in court during their fraud and murder trial. The trio were found guilty on December , , after a jury heard they doused Mr Ragoobeers Polish shop below his flat with  litres of petrol, BBQ fuel and white spirit, and then ignited it. It was very stressful and heartbreaking when you see these three-people sitting in the dock without any emotion, Mr Ragoobeer, who was at work at the time of the blast, said. His we Mary was killed alongside sons Sean, , and Shane, , and Shanes girlfriend Leah Beth Reek.  Kurd, Hassan and Ali had taken out an over-inflated insurance policy and hoped to make pound, in February last year. Speaking to ITV News Central, Mr Ragoobeer added: They are not human, they are not human. And they don’t value the le of a human being. They took our loved ones and they knew that there were people living upstairs because at the back of the shop they’d got a camera and anyone inside the shop they will see people go in and out so how could they say they didn’t know there were people living there  That makes me more angry. Mary, , was described as a loving, devoted mother.  Mr Ragoobeer, of Leicester, said: Mary was a lively woman. She always like to go to parties. She liked having a drink and she laughed a lot but she would always care for the boys. The boys came first for her. His youngest son Scotty was also in the flat with his family on the night of the explosion. Incredibly, he survived the blast after being trapped under the rubble and pulled to safety by police and passers-by. Leicester Crown Court heard Alis girlfriend Viktorija Ijevleva was in the shop at the time of the explosion, and was killed.  She helped obtain the insurance policy, but Ali and his co-conspirators decided she knew too much and that they didnt want to share money from a potential payout - so they let her die.

Nurse Laura-Beth, , from Tameside, Greater Manchester, piled on the pounds while she was on maternity leave after having her son five years ago. She had tried all sorts of diets to shed the weight and keep it off but always ended up back at square one. But she has now managed to lose a staggering five stone in just six months thanks to a revolutionary weight loss programme being trialled at the hospital where she works. Laura-Beth tried the Slimpod app, which uses neuroscience techniques for just nine minutes each day to change the way people think and feel about food.  It is said to help them instinctively make healthier choices and move more, which in turn encourages them to have more willpower and then lose weight. Mum-of-one Laura-Beth was staggered by the impact it had. She has now dropped from a size  to a , going from  and a half stone to just  and a half stone.Laura-Beth said: “Several times I’ve lost weight but put it all back on, and more.I managed to get to a size  a few years ago but was such an emotional eater that the weight just went back on - I could easily eat a full big bar of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk and would snack on sweet stuff non-stop at work to keep me going. “Since I started the Slimpod programme it’s all changed - it was like a switch flicking in my head.I no longer reach for sugary food for comfort, my shopping basket is full of healthy food and I take healthy food into work too.” Laura-Beth features on How to Lose Weight Well on Channel  tonight where Dr Xand Van Tulleken investigatesunconscious persuasion could be the future of dieting.  Slimpod founder Sandra Roycroft-Davis has been using the technique on hundreds of NHS workers across the country. The programme includes video coaching and a unique voice recording that you listen to for just nine minutes a day.It gently retrains the brain to change the way you think and feel about food and yourself. Sandra Roycroft-Davis, a Harley Street weight loss specialist, says: “Where you used to get pleasure from unhealthy food and sugary snacks, your brain starts learning how to feel good when you eat healthy food and take exercise instead.  “Slimpod helps you lose weight without depriving yourself and does what diets can’t.The focus is on changing your behaviour towards food and importantly, taking the emotion out of eating.By empowering you to control what you eat and motivating you to be more active, you lose weight without even having to think about it.” Laura-Beth says: “I’m feeling great - far more positive, confident and healthier. I don’t get out of breath any more and don’t worry about not fitting in my unorm.I also exercise three times a week and love it - I’d prefer to be exercising than eating now! “I know the weight will stay off, because my new eating and exercise habits are here to stay - they’ve become automatic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"passengers evacuated flight manchester abu","story":"NewsPassengers evacuated off flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi after loud bangThe Etihad Airways flight took off from Manchester Airport at .pm before ing just before pm after a loud noise was heard and small fire broke outShareCommentsBySteve Robson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe flight to Abu Dhabi from Manchester Airport was halted\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPassengers have been evacuated off a flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi after a loud bang was heard shortly after take-off.

She has been inspired by an international movement to spread kindness and her new focus is teaching children to be kind. Alison founded Compassionate Inverclyde in Scotland last year and recently launched a new programme called ‘High ’ working with  local schools and thousands of primary age children to demonstrate the simple act of kindness. She developed lesson plans for the schools to implement that is now seeing them create things like ‘kindness quilts’ and handmade friendship bands. “Children are like sponges -you show them the way they will quickly follow,” said Alison. “One school - St Michael’s Primary in Port Glasgow - are doing some beautul kindness quilts that are being given out to the local community. They also present a balloon to a child in assembly who has been particularly kind.  “Other children can nominate a child to be awarded. We as an ordinary community have the responsibility to give back. It is up to us to foster and empower young people to show kindness.” Compassionate Inverclyde has been chosen as a TSB Local Charity Partner for the bank’s Greenock, Port Glasgow and Rothesay branches. Alison, who is trained as a palliative nurse, first set up the social movement to help people at the end of their lives.

Alison is now working with teenagers in the local area including -year-olds at Notre Dame High School in Greenock. “I have about  girls who have nicknamed themselves ‘The Kindness Girls’. They work with people in care homes, the homeless and with premature babies. At this moment in time they are fundraising to put together ‘starter packs’ for parents. Things like baby-grows and wipes.  “I am also working with some -year-olds at St Columbas High School, Gourock, who we are teaching to implement the High  programme and lesson plans to younger pupils. Some of them want to be teachers and this gives them confidence and an idea of planning and communication skills. It also connect them with younger pupils. I want to to raise awareness and promote resilience.” Local children are also involved in a project called ‘Back Home Boxes’, where anyone who lives alone and is being discharged from Inverclyde Royal Hospital is gted a pack of household essentials, with every item donated by the public as well as children and their parents. The box even includes a homemade blanket and card made by the children. More than , boxes have been distributed since the scheme started last year, with  helpers packing and delivering them to patients in Inverclyde Hospital twice a day. One recipient wrote to volunteers and said: “In all of my  years I have never experienced such kindness. This box has touched my heart so deeply.” Alison said: “The dference it has made is amazing. These are people who are going home and there is not even a pint of milk in their fridge. It’s all about kindness.

Hugh Stickland of the Office for National Statistics, behind the figures, said: “With an increasing ageing population and people deciding to have children at an older age, more people across the UK may soon find that they are part of a new sandwich generation.   “This affects more women with women more likely to feel restricted in how much they can work alongside looking after older, sick or disabled relatives, and children.” Mr Stickland added people offering care for more than five hours a week were more likely to suffer mentally. He went on: “Compared with the general population, those who spend more time caring show lower levels of health and le satisfaction, and are more likely to experience symptoms of depression or anxiety.”   Data from the UK Househshyshyold Longitudinal Study, of , people from  to , found the figure for ill mental health was % among those giving  hours or more care a week. That compared with % of those doing less than five hours, and % of the general population. The study also showed people providing  to  hours’ adult care a week were the least satisfied with le and health.This was possibly due to % juggling care and paid work. Alistair McQueen, of Aviva insurshyshyers, said: “As le expectancy increases and more women have shychildren later in le, we can expect the pressures on the sandwich shygeneration to grow.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jayme closs kidnapper picked teen","story":"NewsJayme Closs kidnapper picked teen at RANDOM after seeing her board school busJake Patterson, , told police he prepared for the abduction by buying a ski mask and shaving his head before ambushing the family, killing Jaymes parentsShareByNatalie EvansUS Editor :,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video jayme-closs-found-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man accused of kidnapping Jayme Closs picked his victim at RANDOM after spotting her boarding a school bus, prosecutors say. Jake Patterson, , is accused of holding the -year-old hostage for months after murdering her parents at their home in Wisconsin. Police say Patterson confessed to killing Jaymes dad James with a shotgun while the girl and her mum Denise hid in a bathtub. He is then believed to have shot dead the mother after forcing her to duct tape her daughters mouth shut.  The discovery of Mr and Mrs Closs bodies in October, at the family home in rural Barron with the door blasted open and their daughter gone, sparked a huge search. The hunt ended  days later, last Thursday, when Jayme managed to escape and flagged down a woman walking her dog. Jaymes discovery led police to Patterson who was arrested last week.   On Monday, Patterson appeared via live video from jail, wearing an orange jumpsuit and glasses. During the brief hearing, he offered brief yes-or-no answers to questions from the judge. Patterson will be held on  million bail and is scheduled to appear in court again on February .  He faces first-degree murder charges for the killings of James and Denise Closs, as well as kidnapping and burglary counts. Closs public defenders, Charles Glynn and Richard Jones, told reporters on Sunday they understood the emotions surrounding the case but would rely on the judicial system to treat Patterson fairly.  Patterson told police that when he spotted the teen outside her home getting on the school bus while he was driving to a short-lived job at a local cheese factory, he knew that was the girl he was going to take, according to a criminal complaint. He prepared for the abduction by buying a ski mask, shaving his head so as not to leave any hair evidence and replacing his license plates with stolen ones.   Twice he drove to the house but was scared off after seeing lights on and people there. On October , Jayme Closs told police she was awakened when the family dog began barking and got her parents up as a car entered their driveway. Dressed in black, Patterson shot James Closs through the front door while Jayme and her mother Denise barricaded themselves in a bathroom, according to both Pattersons and Jayme Closs accounts. After kicking down the door, Patterson ordered Denise Closs to tape up her daughter, then shot her dead and dragged Jayme into the trunk of his car, he told police.  On the way to his cabin in Gordon, Wisconsin, about  milesnorth of Barron, Patterson drove past several police cars responding to reports of the shooting, the report says. During her months in captivity, Patterson often trapped Closs under his bed for hours at a time when he left the house or people came over, using plastic boxes and barbells to make it harder for her to get out, he told police. He threatened violence to keep her from trying to escape.  Closs managed to push her way out on Thursday after Patterson said he would be out for a few hours, she told police. She put on a pair of his shoes and walked outside, where she encountered the woman walking her dog.  The two then approached a neighbours house to call police. While Closs warmed up inside, the neighbour, Peter Kasinskas, retrieved his gun and stood watch at the door in case her captor was searching for her, according to the Duluth News Tribune. Soon after, police stopped Patterson, who was driving nearby.

This was exactly how one man felt when hunger struck on a recent flight from Bali to Australia. Brighton-based marketing and events writer, Nick Mosley, really fancied a good sarnie during his Jetstar Airways plane journey, so he ordered himself a deli sandwich trio. But when he received his sandwiches he was left feeling less than impressed with the contents and his stomach, unfortunately, ended up remaining rather empty.   After paying  AUS , for his lunch, Nick was shocked to discover that it was somewhat lacking. One soggy sandwich contained some margarine and a single lettuce leaf, another was the same, but had a little bit of egg in it as well.Taking to Twitter he shared pictures of the sandwiches and their measly fillings.He wrote: I must say @JetstarAirways have a cheek charging AUS for sandwiches... without any fillings...   Great for their bottom line but not so good for filling the tums of customers. JetstarAirways replied to the tweet saying they would look into the issue further. A spokesperson for the company later offered Nick a full refund and added: We apologise for the unusual lack of filling in Mr Mosleys sandwich, and appreciate it did not meet expectations. It is unusual. Weve passed the feedback onto our caterer.  Despite the apology, Nick told The Sun that the sandwich made petrol station food look like a gastronomic feast.He added: I think airline food, whether its included in the ticket price or available to buy on the plane, has to be decent and a fair reflection of the price. There are always going to be people on flights who are on longer journeys with connecting flights, so poor food has a direct impact on well-being as well as the wallet.

As a man of many talents, the Anglo-Indian traveller, surgeon and entrepreneur built important cultural connections between his homeland and England during the course of his le. Here he was most famed for introducing Indian cuisine to the UK, bringing shampoo baths across Europe and his written work. Dean Mahomed was born in  in Patna, then part of the Bengal Presidency, which was once the largest subision of British India, In , Mahomed emigrated to Cork, Ireland, where studied to improve his English language skills at a local school. It was here that he fell in love with Jane Daly, who he eloped with in  even though that time it was illegal for Protestants to marry non-Protestants. Mahomed converted to Anglicanism to marry Jane and they moved to Brighton, England, at the turn of the th century where he began to make his mark on Britain. He died in  in Brighton and was buried at the towns St Nicholas Church.  Author Most notably, on this day in , Mahomed became the very first Indian author to publish a book in English - which Google has chosen to celebrate. The Travels of Dean Mahomed describes a number of important cities in India and military conflicts with local Indian principalities. Literary critic Muneeza Shamsie also notes that he also authored the books Cases Cured and Shampooing Surgeon, Inventor of the Indian medicated Vapour and Sea Water Baths. Restaurateur As well as being an accomplished author, he introduced his countrys cuisine to Britain in  after opening opened the first Indian restaurant in England. The Hindoostane Coffee House was located in George Street, near Portman Square, Central London.   The Epicure’s Almanack, an early London restaurant guide, praised it as a place for nobility to enjoy hookah and luxurious Indian dishes. Despite Indian cuisine going on to become one of the most popular cuisines in the UK, Mahomed was forced to close his restaurant in  due to financial dficulties. Shampoo baths Mahomed also went on to find further success after bringing shampoo baths to Europe. In the UK he was known as the “The Shampooing Surgeon of Brighton after opening a spa in the British seaside town that attracted the rich and royal.  Mahomed’s Baths offered a number of luxurious herbal steam baths and his specialty was a combination of a steam bath and an Indian therapeutic massage. This treatment was named shampooing as it was inspired by the Hindi word champissage meaning “a head massage.” He became so popular that in , King George IV appointed Mahomed as his personal ‘shampooing surgeon’, which greatly improved his business.  Despite his achievements Sake Dean Mahomed began to lose prominence by the Victorian era and up until recently was starting to become forgotten by history.However a renewal of interest in his writings came after poet and scholarAlamgir Hasmi drew attention to him in the s and s. Mahomeds portrait also hangs in the Brighton Museum, which celebrates the man who helped bring together the cultures of his two homelands. And in  the City of Westminster unveiled a Green Plaque commemorating the opening of the Hindoostane Coffee House. This sits at  George Street, near to the original site of the coffee house at  George Street.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3c747b4951f9.06178664-e1547480109838.jpg ","title":"dundee bus stop says service terminates at sinatras nightclub","story":"A reader has voiced their confusion after a bus stop in Dundee apparently lists its destination as a former nightclub in the city.The Tele has received a letter from a commuter who captured a picture of a city centre information board stating that bus service  is terminating at #Sinatras#.They wrote: #I was both confused and amused when Sinatras – presumably the former bar on King Street – appeared as a destination for a Dundee bus recently.#The board pictured is outside Waterstones on Commercial Street, heading westbound, towards the city centre and Ninewells.#It was clearly maling, but has the stop closest to Sinatras – which has been shut for eight years – ever been a final destination for buses in the city #I also assume that “opp Sainsbury’s” and “Kirkonnell Terrace” – notably with two spelling mistakes– are also inidual stops rather than terminals.#The No  bus service links the city centre with Fintry.Dundee council was asked whether there was an error on the information board."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c38c3795e14a4.56177788.jpg ","title":"dundee council could ban cars from busy city centre streets","story":"Cars could be banned from one of Dundee’s most polluted streets under “radical” plans being considered by the council.City development convener Lynne Short said the city centre would likely be “reshaped” to discourage the use of conventional cars and encourage an uptake in public transport and cycling.Ms Short said that while plans were at an early stage, unconventional measures were being considered by council officers.“There are a number of options that we will look to explore, looking at places such as the Seagate,” Ms Short told the Tele.“At the moment, it has very narrow pavements and a very wide road, so it could have a completely dferent shape in the future to encourage active travel.“That all depends on funding, of course.

They will also be able to impose fines.The Seagate and Lochee Road regularly appear on air pollution rankings as two of the  most polluted streets in Scotland.Gavin Thomson, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland , said ideas such as banning polluting traffic were on the right track.He said: “All of these ideas would be great for air quality. Dundee is in a unique situation in that its electric vehicle infrastructure is way ahead of a lot of other cities.“Clean air initiatives may resonate with people.”A likely end goal for Dundee will be encouraging active travel – leaving the car at home in favour of walking, cycling and public transport.The council is endeavouring to improve cycle routes in the city with its Northern Links project, currently out for consultation.However, with , people commuting into Dundee every day by car, Ms Short knows motorists need to be considered.Ideas such as park and ride facilities – which were given a £. million boost in the Tay Cities Deal – are still on the table.Ms Short added: “Active travel is about making it easier to do things without taking the car, and we may have to reshape the city to facilitate that.“If you have , people who park outside the city and come in by bus, that’s a winner in terms of reducing air pollution.”As well as discouraging car use, Scottish ministers are targeting older buses, which can be just as bad for the atmosphere.About £m is on offer for Scottish bus companies to fit their older vehicles to meet the latest emission standards.Xplore Dundee and Stagecoach are introducing new hybrid models which emit less harmful gases, and funding has been secured for hydrogen vehicles.However, Neil Quinney of Dundee Cycling Forum believes “urgent action” is required by the council on a grander scale.He said: “The World Health Organisation states there is no safe level for particulate matter pollution, a major source of which is from the erosion of tyres and brake pads.“Due to this, we believe that to improve air quality in Dundee, we need fewer vehicles coming into the city, not just cleaner engines.“This is why we need a network of high-quality cycle routes throughout Dundee to give residents and visitors the choice to make everyday journeys in healthy and sustainable ways.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc supporters society plan to hear

So for us it was a massive win to get all three.“Locos are one of the best teams in the league and are rightly up near the top so it was a big win. It sends out a message and I think we’ve done that all season by continuing to win.“The pressure is on teams to keep with us. We’re leading the pack and they need to try to keep up.”On the hard-fought win over the Railwaymen, he added: “It was one of the toughest games we’ve had this year and we were saying afterwards in the dressing room that was maybe the hardest we’ve had to battle.“That is credit to Locos because they made it a hard game for us and defended well.“All we could do was keep pushing. The gaffer said at half-time it didn’t matterwe scored in the th minute or the th minute, we needed to keep going.“We are going to create chances with the quality we have and luckily one fell to me and it was just a case of nodding it home.”Cove boss John Sheran said: “I felt Inverurie came to stop us playing and first half we played some fantastic football, we just couldn’t get the breakthrough. There were good saves and sometimes the final pass not being right.“We showed everything in terms of the football we can play, we can dig in and we had to show a lot of character in the second half.“We said at half-time we would just have to grind out something. I thought we were applying pressure all the time and it was good to get the three points.“When a team sits in with people behind the ball it’s dficult to break down. The longer the game went on they had to come out more and that may have helped more.”In the first half Locos keeper Andy Reid made good saves to keep out a Harry Milne header and Megginson’s low drive.In the second half Milne had two more headers saved by Reid, who needed more than five minutes of treatment at one stage after a boot in the head.Cove’s breakthrough came in the th minute when Milne’s left-wing cross bounced off Chris Herd and Megginson converted from close range.Inverurie manager Neil Cooper said: “I was disappointed for the boys because they competed really well throughout the game.“I was just disappointed because we didn’t pass the ball as well as we can and that’s why we didn’t create as many chances as I would’ve liked.“I still felt we deserved a draw and were a bit hard done by, but we didn’t defend a cross to the far post.“Normally one of your team-mates can bail you outyou don’t win the first ball, but we didn’t win the second ball.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-swimming-pool-latest-to-close-due-to-technical-issues","story":"SWIMMERS in Galashiels have faced a high and dry start to the new year.The towns pool was closed due to mechanical problems on Monday, December .And despite repairs being carried out during the planned holiday closure staff were unable to open the doors again on Thursday or Friday.A spokeswoman for operators Live Borders said: \"Following improvement yesterday , we are hopeful of getting the temperature up to suitable level and reopening over the weekend.\"We apologise for any inconvenience this closure may have caused.\"This latest closure comes just days after Selkirk Swimming Pool was closed for a week in the run up to Christmas for similar technical problems.We reported last month how during   attendances at swimming pools, gyms and other sports facilities across the region had fallen year-on-year in   by more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"good-behaviour-order-for-bowden-man-after-new-year-bust-up","story":"A BOWDEN man involved in a New Years Day bust-up with his partner has been ordered to be of good behaviour for the next three months.Graeme Reid pleaded guilty to shouting and swearing during the incident.The -year-old also admitted threatening his partner with violence and repeatedly striking the door of a house in Dick Road.The case will recall at Selkirk Sherf Court on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"organisers-hope-to-rekindle-peebles-torchlight-procession","story":"ORGANISERS of Peebles Hogmanay Torchlight Procession are hopeful the spectacle willthis year ndash after cancelling the  event to give volunteers a break.Event director Neil Dalgleish told us: ldquoWe have had a full on year and we wanted to give volunteers a deserved break at the new year with their families.ldquoA huge amount of work goes into organising the event and we will have to start preparing now for .The procession has taken place in the town since .

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the proposals on Tuesday, with the developers hoping to submit a planning application with East Lothian Council in the spring.The site, between the East Coast Mainline, Beveridge Row and the Lochend Campus of the townrsquos primary school, was earmarked for development in East Lothian Councilrsquos Local Development Plan .Currently, the plans are still at an early stage, with approximately  houses earmarked for the .-hectare site.The proposed development, known as Hallhill North, would also include an area designated for a recreation sports pitch for community use in close proximity to the primary school.Options for renewable energy provision are being considered for the site.The LDP notes: ldquoAny development here is subject to the mitigation of any development related impacts, including on a proportionate basis for any cumulative impacts with other proposals including on the transport network and on education and community facilities as appropriate.Ahead of a public exhibition, which will be held at the townrsquos Hallhill Sports Centre from pm to .pm on Tuesday, Ken Ross, from Hallhill Developments Ltd, noted the impact the Hallhill development had made in the

Lothian economy and will generate more than  jobs.Mr Ross said: ldquoHallhill North will not only involve much-needed housing, including affordable housing, but will also include provision for a sports pitch for community use.Jacquie Bell, Dunbar Community Council secretary, said: ldquoThere is not much we can do about the go-ahead outline, I think what we can try to influence is the detail of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as

One can imagine both finding a lot that is pertinent in director Josie Rourkersquos determinedly modern drama.Not modern in the sense that everyone wears jeans and jumpers. Heaven forbid. Rourkersquos day job is artistic director at the Donmar Warehouse in London, and she puts her eye for staging and design to sumptuous use in recreating the th century courts of Mary at Holyrood and Elizabeth in London .Tourism boost ahead from Mary Queen of ScotsWhere Rourkersquos drama is of the here and now is in its feminist retelling of Maryrsquos story, in particular the way it places the blame for her downfall on misogyny. This is a #MeToo Mary Queen of Scots, one who warns other women to be wary of men - ldquoTheir love is not the same as their respect - and who is a bold, strategic thinker and doer.As for how Scotland comes across, that is a mixed bag. It looks magnicent, but politically we appear a right shower, a mob straight outta Game of Thrones who love fighting and copulating in equal measure. Decide for yourself the accuracy of that.Saoirse Ronan plays Mary , as a budding flower of Scotland, brimming with le and determination that Elizabeth shall name her as successor. It is not long till she experiences the wrath of John Knox . ldquoWe have a scourge upon the land, bellows the minister. ldquoIt is worse than pestilence, it is a woman with a crown.With a screenplay by Beau Willimon, based on John Guyrsquos Queen of Scots: The True Le of Mary Stuart, the film is built around an event that did not happen: the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary. Though this might dismay purists, it works well as a plot driver. When the two finally get together it marks the point of nofor Mary, post Darnley, post the savage murder of David Rizzio, and post accusations of her adultery.Ronan looks stunning in the role, her red hair glowing, that Celtic complexion radiant. Have no fear: the Scots accent passes muster. Elizabeth, played by Margot Robbie, is equally breathtaking, though in dferent ways. Robbie has the more complex character in the barren queen who was a better politician than most around her, and she duly rips the bones from the part, hence the Bafta nomination for best supporting actress. Ronanrsquos Mary, being almost two-dimensional on occasion, does not have the same impact.Jack Lowden on Mary Queen of Scots and flying a SpitfireThough the women have the lionessrsquos share of the drama, Martin Compston shines as Lord Bothwell, Maryrsquos initial protector, with Jack Lowden just the right mix of slipperiness and cowardice as Darnley, and Adrian Lester his usual silky self as Lord Randolph, the noble who tried and failed to broker peace between the two queens.At the rather rushed but thrilling end it is Ronan who dominates, her final look to camera enough to chill the blood.

One minister explained: ldquoShe said we have got to keep Jeremy Corbyn as far away as possible from No  to do that, we have got to come together.\"This morning, John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, will decide which of a string of amendments will be voted upon, including one to guarantee a no-deal outcome is avoided and one to ensure the Irish backstop ends by December  .If such amendments were passed, the margin of the defeat on Mrs Mayrsquos plan could be reduced signicantly.In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon tried to bolster the Conservative rebels and opposition Remainers by insisting: ldquoThe chances of remaining are at their highest since the EU referendum.The First Minister declared: ldquoMPs must come together to vote down this bad deal, rule out no-deal, extend the Article  process and call another referendum. This opportunity must be grasped.In a speech in Leave-supporting Stoke-on-Trent, Mrs May urged Conservative colleagues to back her plan ldquofor the countrys sake,\" warning them a refusal to do so would be the \"height of recklessness\".However, Government whip Gareth Johnson defied his leader by quitting, saying it was clear there had been \"no signicant change\" to the Withdrawal Agreement.This followed the publication of the EUrsquos letters, which, the PM claimed offered \"valuable new clarications and assurances, which would help assure MPs their fears were misplaced. The letters carried \"legal force,\" she insisted, and made ldquoabsolutely clear the backstop is not a threat or a trap\".But Labourrsquos Keir Starmer dismissed the letters as a mere ldquoreiteration of the EUs existing position while Nigel Dodds for the Democratic Unionists said they were ldquomeaningless.Later in a Commons statement, Mrs May urged colleagues to ldquotake a second look at her plan.ldquoIt is not perfect but when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask: Did we deliver on the countrys vote to leave the EU, did we safeguard our economy, security or Union, or did we let the British people down rsquo\"The PM also warned a no-deal Brexit would ldquostrengthen the hand of those campaigning for Scottish independence or indeed those demanding a border poll in Northern Ireland, noting: ldquoSurely, this is the real threat to our Union.Jeremy Corbyn claimed Mrs May had \"completely and utterly failed\" to allay MPs concerns about her Brexit Plan.He said the Brussels letters did ldquonot give the legal assurances this House was promised and contain nothing but warm words and aspirations\".The Labour leader complained: ldquoShe has not once tried to work with Parliament to construct a Brexit deal that this House and the country can support and now she is left facing a humiliating defeat and is blaming everybody but herself.He added: ldquoThe Government is in disarray its clearthe Prime Ministers deal is rejected tomorrow, its time for a general election its time for a new government.\"Ian Blackford for the SNP insisted the offer from Brussels on further assurances was a humiliation for Mrs May.ldquoThe Prime Minister is simply in fantasy land, presenting her statement as bringing changes when it does not.

Unfortunately sand will damage locks, window mechanisms, vehicles and grass.\"The councillor went on to advise people to try to wash the sand off all surfaces and said senior council officials from the roads department and the flood team will also be investigating.\"The longer term and very serious question is what is causing the level of our beach to rise so quickly in recent months \" he added.Pennyland Primary School was closed for the afternoon as the winds began to rise. The roof of a McColls store in the Mount Pleasant area blew off but nobody was reported to be injured.The Dounreay nuclear site was officially closed at pm. All  staff were evacuated after winds battered the area for a couple of hours.A spokeswoman for Dounreay Site Restoration said \"the safety of staff was paramount\".Wicks weather watcher Keith Banks said on Monday: \"There have been gusts in the hurricane force  category. Strongest gust so far in Wick today has been mph. A severe gale force  west north westerly has been blasting Wick since noon.\"Chief Inspector Stewart Mackie said: \"If you are driving a vehicle which may be vulnerable to being blown over in such conditions along exposed routes including bridges, please exercise additional caution and plan your route to avoid exposed areas or consider cancelling your journey until conditions improve.\"Previous incidents have clearly shown the dangers of driving such vehicles and the subsequent danger created for other road users, emergency services and recovery operatives where incidents have occurred due to drivers ignoring warnings.\"Winter driving is a question of common sense and all drivers should ask themselvesthey really need to travel when conditions are poor.\"No-one should ever place themselves at risk on the road and it may be worth making alternative arrangements such as delaying travel until conditions improve or using public transport.\"Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118939.jpg","title":"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare","story":"Former RAF pilot Don Mason, who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmPolice say that traffic is flowing as normal now following a road traffic accident near Finstown, this evening, Monday.

A taskforce will begin work to simply existing process, alongside a group of producers, consumers and environmental organisations who will look to drive longer term changes as agreed following a Liberal Democrat amendment to the government motion.The two isles MSPs argue these, and all future groupings, must include island representatives to ensure the perspective and needs of islands are taken into account.Mr McArthur and Mr Scott said: “If the Scottish Government intends to respect the Islands Act in any meaningful way, the opinions of farmers and crofters from our islands must be heard loud and clear in the negotiations that lie ahead.“Our farming and crofting communities are rightly anxious about what the future holds. While this is a familiar story across the country, the unique demands faced by the sector in the islands must be taken fully into account during any transition from the CAP.“This is essentialthe Government is to ensure the sustainability of farming and crofting in the isles.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The next two weeks could be the most important for the future of our country in the st Century. Yes, that is a big claim, and it is only the beginning of , but the vote on Theresa May#s Withdrawal Agreement and the response she gives a week today, as she must, is likely to determine the continued existence of the UK, the laws it operates under and how we behave as a society. If the Prime Minister plays it badly, and in particular makes gets her response wrong the traditional acceptance of evolutionary social and economic change may perish in bonfires, demonstrations and mutual mistrust in all politicians and the democracy we cherish. This may seem alarmist, but let me be plain – such are the forces manoeuvring to usurp our democracy that faith in our institutions may simply evaporate and be replaced with a far less pleasant belief that direct action is what will bring results.I work internationally and spend my time more or less equally between Edinburgh, London, France and Ireland. I can see what is happening around me in the EU and in the UK – and in the last six months all of us, the whole continent, have begun a descent into mayhem and anarchy. From my own experience this new mood is not to be welcomed, nor is it especially the responsibility of Theresa May or her government, even though we might blame herwe rely for our outlook on reading only UK media sources.The EU negotiators have sought from the outset to demonstrate to countries that might warm to the UK’s independence of thought that leaving or loosening ties with the EU should not be considered. I am thinking of Greece, Italy and even France. Yes, France! Who can deny that France, unlike the UK or especially Scotland, is not at the heart of the EU  Yet I can attest that the mood in France is at breaking-point it is played down by the British media, especially the broadcasters, but it is developing into an alarmingly chaotic and violent phase the likes of which has not been seen since  when the fth republic nearly fell and de Gaulle had ultimately to resign. The Gilet Jaunes or Yellow Vest protests against President Macron have not subsided, not been bought off – they are growing and arriving in many cities beyond Paris, such as Bordeaux and Rouen, in massive numbers and requiring tear gas and heavy handed responses that we would think shocking were they to happen here in the UK. These demonstrations are multaceted in their grievances – and are neither left-wing or right-wing, although they contain extremes from both wings – but they do raise what might be called populist concerns about double standards in the application or acceptance of open immigration, justice, public taxes and spending – or the growing gulf between those who do well out of the current system and those who lose by it. Yet France is no longer alone, the Gilet Jaunes protest are now erupting in other countries, and there have been a few copy-cat instances in London – but there are now calls across the political spectrum for it to become a physical presence in UK political dialogue. I say to all readers this is not a road anyone should wish to go down or support unless they believe brute force trumps reason and debate.I have driven through the barricades and intimidation that comes at the hands of such demonstrations and it is fearsome, alarming and costly. This is what our parliamentarians are on the verge of ushering in across the UK. By refusing now to accept that the people voted, deal or no deal, in  to leave the European Union – in the largest-ever UK demonstration of democratic instruction – and that in turn those same MPs agreed by a huge majority to invoke Article  to deliver that result, all faith in our democratic institutions is being lost. It is not dficult to imagine – with France as an example – of where we are heading.When MPs call the electorate stupid, dumb, racist and bigoted for voting against the establishment they invite a response that may lack subtlety but is a direct reflection of their own abandonment of humility. The arrogance and hypocrisy of so many remainer MPs reeks like the rotting fish they would preserve through the EU’s fisheries discard policy. Changing parliamentary procedure is the latest debasement of the British playing by the rules.Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement must be voted down – for even beyond the unecessary “backstop” it is worse than being a fully paid-up member of the EU – where the UK’s unity is not put at risk and we at least would have a modicum of influence about our future. How May then responds is crucial. As the law stands we must leave on  March and adopt the world-wide conventions of WTO rules. It is a deal with everyone and we can then move on to establish better outcomes. To instead repeatedly betray promises and overturn the referendum result will no doubt bring on mass demonstrations in the disguise of Gilet Jaunes, infiltrated I expect by anarchists looking for a fight, the extremes of left and right and a hydra-headed unaccountable extra-parliamentary leadership that cannot easily be tamed.Our MPs must vote down the “deal” that is not a deal and then move to leave on  March. Anything less will see the repudiation of our democracy end peaceful change as we have known it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4856119.1547465444!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon s spokesman in smear claim over alex salmond case","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A spokesman for Nicola Sturgeon has claimed the First Minister is being #smeared# in an escalation of the isions within the SNP over allegations against Alex Salmond.The comments by Ms Sturgeon’s spokesman follow newspaper reports that the First Minister was made aware of allegations of sexual harassment against her predecessor before a meeting between her and Mr Salmond.On Sunday, the First Minister referred herself to the watchdog that polices the ministerial code over a series of meetings and telephone conversations between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond.: Nicola Sturgeon refers herself to watchdog over Alex Salmond meetingsUnder the ministerial code, all government business must be official recorded and meetings set up by civil servants.The Scottish Government lost a legal challenge over its handling of the matter after it emerged that a civil servant in charge of the investigation had prior contact with the two women who lodged the complaints. The case has cost the taxpayer £,.The allegations made by two women, which Mr Salmond denies, remain under investigation by police who have spoken to staff at Bute House.Speaking to journalists on Monday, the First Minister’s spokesman said: “This appears to be an attempt to smear the First Minister.“Suggestions by Mr Salmond’s ‘insiders’ that the First Minister knew about the investigation before  April are not true.”“The suggestion put to Ms Sturgeon’s Chief of Staff by the Times, that she knew of complains when she met someone who could be described as an intermediary for Alex Salmond on  March, is also not true.”A spokesman for Mr Salmond was quoted saying in response: “We will not be commenting on the content of private meetings or discussions on or off the record but Alex has made it clear that,asked, he will be happy to give evidence to the  of independent advisers [on the ministerial code].The spokesman added: “In the interests of accuracy it is the case that the First Minister’s senior special adviser knew of the existence of complaints against Alex some time before the meeting of  April and that she initiated the first contact through an intermediary.“They then arranged the meeting [with Ms Sturgeon] which Alex asked for. Alex has no certainty as to the state of knowledge of the First Minister before then.“In any case we regard this controversy about these meetings as of secondary importance.: Euan McColm: Nicola Sturgeon puts trust of her floating constituency to the test“The substantive issue right now is not the possibility that Nicola Sturgeon may have broken the ministerial code but the fact despite repeated warnings the Scottish Government behaved in a manner which was ‘unlawful’, ‘unfair’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’ and further that their decisions have been struck down by the Court of Session at a cost to the Scottish people of over £,.”Over the weekend, it emerged that a criminal investigation is underway over the leak of details about the allegations to a tabloid newspaper.The Information Commissioner’s Office confirmed that the Scottish Government is at the centre of an investigation into possible breaches of the Data Protection Act.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This playground is a major attraction for families and children, not only from Balmoral but indeed much further afield, as it is part of the fantastic natural resource that is the Lagan Valley Regional Park.“The playground will be closed for around three months whilst the site is levelled and landscaped and a range of new equipment is installed.”Cllr McAteer said the refurbishment will ensure that the play park will be inclusive of children who have disabilities.“New equipment includes a roundabout which is wheelchair friendly, sit-in rockers for small children with disabilities and basket sit-in swings for more senior children as well as slides and climbing frames which have transfer stations which will be wheelchair friendly.”“It’s a wonderful design and Council staff have done a great job in bringing the project to shovel ready stage. Weather permitting, it should be in great shape and opened for the spring.”The new-look playground will also benefit from new safety features including a new three metre pedestrian crossing to the playground, finished in tactile paving and new anti-vandal park benches.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37708745.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/Theresa_May.jpg","title":"dup rejects meaningless assurances from eu on brexit backstop dodds calls for real changes to withdrawal agreement","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nothing has changed.\"The North Belfast MP said the letters bolstered the parties concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop still stands, there has been no change to the withdrawal agreement and that Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels.Instead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement.DUP MP Nigel DoddsFacebookTwitterRegarding the Prime Minister’s comment about “changes to everyday le in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our Union at risk” Mr Dodds said: “The Prime Minister must explain this comment. What exactly would the Government be changing \"If this is nothing more than scaremongering, then the Prime Minister should cease from such foolish talk. Indeed, the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that the Republic of Ireland is not making preparations for a hard border even in the event of no deal being agreed.”The current backstop would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union to prevent a hard border in the island of Ireland.Prime Minister Theresa May making a speech during a visit to the Portmeirion pottery factory in Stoke-on-Trent. Ben Birchall PA WireThe Prime Minister warned MPs, who will vote on the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday evening, of the \"catastrophic harm\" voting down her deal would have on public faith in their elected representatives.Mrs May also said that,the withdrawal agreement was voted down, MPs risk a no-deal Brexit or Brexit not occurring at all.With no deal we would have: no implementation period, no security co-operation, no guarantees for UK citizens overseas, no certainty for businesses and workers here in Stoke and across the UK, and changes to everyday le in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our Union at risk.Theresa MayFacebookTwitter\"The only ways to guarantee we do not leave without a deal are to abandon Brexit, betraying the vote of the British people, or to leave with a deal,\" she said.\"The only deal on the table is the one MPs will vote on tomorrow night.

That represents an increase of £.bn, real estate adviser Savills found. The total value of the UKs housing stock reached a record £. trillion in , the analysis found. Despite a slowdown in the housing market amid Brexit concerns, the total value of UK housing stock increased by £bn. The gains came from outside London, as the total value of its residential housing stock recorded a £.bn fall, the first decrease since . Londons housing stock is still worth £. trillion - more than four times the combined value of homes in Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardf, Bristol, Liverpool, and Sheffield. The capital still accounts for nearly a quarterof UK housing value, compared with a fth a decade ago, according to Savills. Some £.bn of the increase in the value of housing stock last year was due to house prices going up, equating to a £, price increase per home. While % of the increase in the value of housing stock last year came from house price increases, the remaining % - or £.bn - was due to new homes being built. Savills said this is the highest proportion contributed by new housing development since  and reflects the Government focus on building more new homes. Within the £. trillion total, the collective value of the private rented sector topped £. trillion for the first time. Across the UK, in percentage terms, Wales was the region showing the biggest gains in the value of housing stock in , with a .% increase adding £. billion.

He had gone to the home twice intending to kidnap her but was not able to do it because too many people were around, the complaint said.On the night she was abducted, Jayme told police, she was asleep in her room when the family dog started barking.

We don’t take that lightly. But we have a job to do in protecting our client,” Mr Jones said.Police collected more than , tips following Jayme’s disappearance but no hard leads emerged.Then on Thursday, a woman walking her dog spotted Jayme on a road near Gordon, a town about an hour’s drive north of Barron.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view.

Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers.

That would mean, he said, that “we would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us”.Dismissing the EU letter as “meaningless”, Mr Dodds said that instead “the prime minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement”.The North Belfast MP also took sharp exception to a comment which Mrs May made in a heavily trailed speech in Stoke where she said that no deal could mean “changes to everyday le in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our Union at risk”. Mr Dodds said: “The prime minister must explain this comment. What exactly would the government be changing  If this is nothing more than scaremongering, then the prime minister should cease from such foolish talk.”Later in the Commons Mr Dodds asked Mrs May“she admits that nothing has fundamentally changed” as a result of the EU letter. Mrs May replied that there had been “further assurances” from the EU. However, she added: “But I recognise that what I have brought back ... is not what some members wanted from the European Union. But it is not the case that this has not gone further than when we were initially discussing the debate [sic]. There have been some further assurances from the European Union, but I accept that those are not the same levels of assurance that some members of this House wished [to see].”DUP MP Jim Shannon put it to Mrs May that she was now putting forward a “watered down and ” form of unionism which treated Northern Ireland dferently. Mrs May replied by saying that she had published a document last week which she thought should reassure unionists.In the Lords, DUP chairman Lord Morrow said: “It is patently clear that Northern Ireland is to be treated dferently from other regions of the United Kingdom. “From the beginning of the negotiations, we set one red line for the government – that there could be no new border in the Irish Sea, thus undermining the economic and constitutional position or integrity of the United Kingdom.”Lord Morrow turned his fire on Dublin, condemning the “belligerent attitude of the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland” which he said had been “downright unhelpful”.He accused Leo Varadkar of “being obstructionist in every way that he can and instead of working in the best interests of the Republic ofIreland and the United Kingdom, he is more content to meddle and make things as dficult as he possibly can”.Mournes tragedies: ‘They were members of our community, we are devastated’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendPrisoner on the loose in N.I.Mourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains falls          ..

Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.Robert Maxwell from Clough and his friend Nigel Cree from Seaforde are two ex-servicemen involved in Let’s Do, a charity which aims to aid physically and mentally injured veteran’s rehabilitation through outdoor group events.The UK-wide charity is most active in the Isle of Man, but the Clough pair want to add to the charity’s outdoor assets in Northern Ireland.They are in the process of setting up a fishing retreat at Kennedy’s Bog – located by farmland owned by Robert’s father – which they hope will be ready by the summer. Nigel said: “What we’ve decided to do is turn it into a fishery that the charity can use to let veterans fish and relax a bit. We’ve also got the Mournes right beside us so that’s another outdoor activity they can do while they’re here.Our reporter gets some fishing tip from ex-serviceman Nigel Cree. Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.“This is our baby. There’s projects where in the UK but we want to have something to offer in Northern Ireland for veterans here or from where in the UK to come over.”Robert said: “To start off we cleaned the lake out – you were getting four to five foot of water and then five to six foot of pure sludge.“Then Nigel and I built a bridge over the lake. Next we’ll be building two fishing stands.”The bridge and two fishing stands are to be named after servicemen who died during the Troubles, or later as a result of injuries suffered during the conflict.Of the river’s fishing potential, Nigel said: “Originally there were rudd in it. The ministrygave us some more rudd, perch and tench. They put about  in plus there would already have been a natural head of . We have a decent head of fish in there.” A keen fisherman himself, Nigel added: “I think anything which helps people relax and they’re in good company has got to be of benefit.“The activity is what we can offer to get them out of the house, but it’s really about the company.”Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Robert said: “We could be facilitating over  veterans in a year easily. Who we’re aiming for are guys who are either mentally or physically disabled.”Robert’s Army career ended as a result of the injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident in .He lost an arm in the hit and run crash and he also suffered head injuries and nerve damage. Since then Robert has suffered from PTSD .He said: “I was in a bad way – physically and mentally. You can fix the body but the mind isn’t as easy to repair. PTSD never really goes away.“Through our charity we’re treating disabled veterans like ordinary iniduals and not patronising them.“We can’t offer financial support but we can offer peer support.”After his accident Robert volunteered in a pastoral care role offering support to injured military veterans.This led to the the development of Let’s Do veteran’s support charity, set up in .Let’s Do is a veteran run charity which has helped people overcome disabilities since .The main aim of the charity is to help ex-servicemen and women to come to terms with injuries and disabilities – such as amputees, those with limited vision, partial paralysis and PTSD – through outdoor activities that will encourage them to become involved and help them to grow confidence whilst becoming comfortable with their disabilities.For more information see www.letsdoevents.infoWhen Robert’s marriage fell apart, his we stayed in the family home while Robert moved into a wooden cabin on his father’s farm.Robert wants the cabin to form phase two of the fishing project by renovating it to allow fellow veterans to stay over for respite.Nigel commented: “Through the course of our work we learn about people who have chosen a le of isolation because of PTSD and injuries suffered during their service.“For instance we’ve learnt about a guy who is so depressed that he hasn’t left the house in eight years. He used to fish. I’m hoping we can use that to get him out of the house.“There are people out there who feel abandoned. Largely men. Quite a lot have been in a family, their marriage has collapsed, they live in isolation.”Robert added: “Big military charities generate lots of money, but they’ve become corporate and ex-servicemen who need help most are falling through the cracks.“It’s the guys who we know about who are being ignored because they’re not high profile enough, there’s no publicity mileage in them.“Funding for our charity is very ad hoc. In fishing terms we’re the minnows.“We don’t have a great deal of budget and volunteers, but those who are involved work extremely hard.”Asked , considering the trauma he has suffered, he still would have signed up to join the army, Robert said: “Yes, my biggest regret is not being able to achieve more in the service. I can see why there is recruiting issues now when you look at the way the veterans are being treated.”try catch  TrendingMourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains fallsPSNI appeal for parents to know where your children are - after -year-old rushed to AE with vodka intoxicationGlenn Irwin: I want record six wins at this years North West Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution          ..

Pic: Rebecca Black PA WireShe claimed “many in the British political establishment have played a game of chicken with Ireland, and with Irish interests”, and blasted that as “a disreputable way to carry out your politics”.Flanked by Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir and party vice president Michelle O’Neill as she spoke to the media at Stormont, Ms McDonald said whatever transpires at Westminster, “it is essential that Irish interests are protected north and south”.“That has been our objective from the get go and that is the message we have consistently shared with the British Government and indeed our partners at a European level,” she said.“We have commitments from our partners at a European level, that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and understood, and will be protected in the most fundamental of ways and we expect that those commitments will be honoured.”Ms McDonald went on to describe the Irish backstop as the “bottom line”, and claimed that anyone seeking to “dilute” the backstop “isn’t dealing in political realities”.She blasted the position of the Democratic Unionist Party opposing the backstop as “reckless and irresponsible”.“It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland,” she said.The Sinn Fein president also commented on meetings between Northern Ireland’s parties on Monday at Stormont.Ms McDonald described the two-year collapse of devolved government at Stormont as a “matter of great frustration to us”.The powersharing institutions collapsed in January  following a break down in relations between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein.Numerous rounds of political talks have failed to see Stormont restored, with Sinn Fein’s call for an Irish language act among the sticking points.Brexit: DUP denounces EU letter on backstop as meaningless Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Ms McDonald said her party regards the ongoing lack of local government as a “disgrace”.“That is plainly because others have sought to deny our fundamental rights, basic rights to sections of our society, and that’s an intolerable situation,” she said.When asked how her party’s meeting with the Democratic Unionists had gone, Ms McDonald said she had had a “good conversation” with Arlene Foster, but said she did not detect any sht in the party’s positions.“I am always very conscious of the need for dialogue, but I don’t have a sense there has been any move, or sht or reassessment in the DUP positions,” she said.“I think that is a very great pity, I don’t believe that is a sustainable position from their point of view.“I had a good conversation with Arlene Foster, we set out our respective positions, and I have set out for her very clearly that the rights of sections of our community can’t be denied by the DUP.“We have a very determined focus on having genuine, full-blooded powersharing where respect and parity of esteem is not just political rhetoric but actually is the reality in terms of how we do our work.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.Mourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsAlex Kane: Karen Bradleyrsquos border poll talk both stupid and deliberately provocative          ..

She is well aware that unionists – and not just the DUP – are worried about the precise legal constitutional status of the ‘backstop’ and that’s because it is cloaked in uncertainty. On Friday she had the chance to address those worries in an interview with the BBC’s Mark Devenport. She also had a chance to address them earlier in the week when the issue was raised at Cabinet.Karen Bradley ignored the chance to give any reassurance to unionistsBut here’s what she said in her interview to Mark: “I do know what my obligations are under the Belfast Good Friday agreement with regards to the principle of consent and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their future and their constitutional status and I’m aware of those obligations as secretary of state.” Not one word, not one single word of reassurance to unionists. Not one sentence, let alone a paragraph to let them know that their worries were unnecessary. Just a threat to the DUP:you don’t vote for the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday – evenit still contains the backstop – then don’t be surprisedI may have to consider the possibility of a border poll fairly soon. It was a stupid thing to say in the circumstances. More worryingly, she was being deliberately provocative. She knew exactly what she was saying and how it would be interpreted.The power to call a border poll does lie with the secretary of state, although it would never be exercised without the authority of the prime minister and Cabinet. Here’s the relevant passage from the  Act: ‘The Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purposes of section  on a date specied in the order. Subject to paragraph , the Secretary of State shall exercise the power...at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.’The key word in all of this is ‘likely.’ It’s a very loose, open to all sorts of interpretation word . A secretary of state could, for example, argue that, a unionists no longer have a majority in the Assembly b in the last few elections unionistshave not polled an overall majority of the votes cast c recent opinion polls suggest that a particular Brexit deal, or no deal at all, would increase support for Irish unity. On that evidence alone a secretary of state could make a reasonable case thatthere was a border poll it ‘might well happen’ that the pro-Union side would lose. The issue has been discussed in previous Cabinets and all of these points will have been made. Mrs Bradley didn’t couldn’t deny that the issue of a border poll was raised again at Tuesday’s cabinet. Whatever one thinks of Theresa May – and I’m no fan – she does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who oversaw the unravelling of the United Kingdom. Her concern – and every prime minister’s concerns are focused on the ‘national interest’ – is that a no deal or ‘hard’ deal increases the pressure for a border poll. And while it seems likely to me that such a poll would see a win for the pro-Union side, nothing can be taken for granted. Karen Bradley will not have made the unilateral decision to raise the issue of a border poll. She was told to do so by the prime minister: and Mrs Bradley is the sort of politician who will always do what she is told. The trouble is, once that particular card has been played it is very dficultto remove it from the table.But, as I’ve already said, threatening the DUP is probably not the wisest thing to do at this point . Mind you, I think the DUP weakened its own hand by saying that it would probably vote for Mrs May in a vote of no confidence, evenshe fails to get through a Withdrawal Agreement which still includes the backstop. How many times does she have to ‘betray’them before they turn on her The DUP believes that the backstop undermines the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. That’s a fair point to make, given the fact that there is very little clarity about its duration, or when and how it can be abandoned. The latest calculation the DUP has to make is how serious the prime minister – or her potential successor, either Conservative or Labour – is about a border poll. Given the upending of local dynamics caused by Brexit I think it would be an extraordinarily ‘courageous’ prime minister or taoiseachwho would decide to call a border poll amidst the present chaos.That said, we are reaching the end of the poker game and all hands will have to be revealed fairly shortly. The DUP’s is not as strong as it needs to be at this point and Leo Varadkar has overplayed his. But there’s still everything to play for. The key player, of course, remains the House of Commons and I still suspect that Parliamentary sovereigntywill, in the end, come down in favour of a very soft landing.Swire amendment will not reassure DUP or Brexiteers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingFirst pictures: Two killed in separate Mournes fallsMourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains fallsGlenn Irwin: I want record six wins at this years North West PSNI appeal for parents to know where your children are - after -year-old rushed to AE with vodka intoxication          ..

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Once we get sight of the papers it will be handed straight into the hands of our legal team for further guidance on what our options are going forward. “We will play our part but we can’t do it without you the community this is a challenge we need to meet head on together. So please turn out in numbers at either of the meetings in Lurgan this evening.“Tonight is the night the Education Authority begin their box ticking exercise. And be under no illusion as far as they are concerned that is all this process will be to them unless the community rise up against a predetermined outcome that was decided back in . “In  the EA legal team put a temporary halt on the full closure of Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High School due to process not being followed. Two years on and we are about to enter a public consultation process with a predetermined outcome that will be so stacked against any possibility of Lurgan retaining a Senior High School that it may well have come straight from the Chairman Mao handbook of asserting control of pre-determined outcomes. “We already know Portadown and Tandragee parents will be consulted during this process to determine whether or not to close a school in Lurgan this in itself tells you how much the outcome has been stacked against Lurgan children with the EA hopeful they have the number to influence the outcome. “The Education Authority told EEL last year their preferred optionwhich will undoubtedly have been their starting point for their paper that will be put to you. An honest and open process would not begin with the answer and working backwards with the questions. “We are in no doubt there will be smoke and mirrors, many half truths and some downright lies come out through this consultation process, but we urge you the community do not let these people take us for the fools they obviously believe we are.

We have known for years the Dickson Plan is not an education pathway the Education Authority are happy to support with numerous EA reports highlighting this position. So to destroy the Dickson Plan by removing that pathway in Lurgan through slight of hand would be a perfect outcome for them.”Presenting their alternative they said: “There is currently a proposal put forward which we have already heard from certain quartersis not within the Dickson Plan, which is simply . “It is an - High School on the Toberhewny site retaining Academic selection at  .”They added: “We believe this to be the only real alternative option for Lurgan and you can see clearly why.

He had suffered from multiple sclerosisfor  years, and was an inspiration to all who came into contact with him. He was famed for his cheery smile and disposition, especially when he was able to move around his ‘adopted’ home of Tandragee in his little motorised buggy – but sadly, in recent years he was virtually confined to the house at Knockview Drive which he shared with we Liz. They have two daughters, Sinead and Bronagh, and a son Niall. There are nine grandchildren, with Liz being the former Liz McKillop, one of a highly-respected Tandragee family. Finbarr was one of the youngest of a Portadown family of , his parents being the late Dr Eamon Fleming and Josie Fleming. They were brought up in the same building as the surgery at Church Street, and he is the second of the family to pass away, the first being Fidelma in November past. He is survived by Eciar, Fionnuala, Eithne, Ciaran, Eamonn, Nessa, Aideen, Eimear, Niamh and Fergus. Finbarr Flemingwas educated at the Convent School and St Columba’s in Portadown after which he attended the Christian Brothers in Armagh. He went from there to undergo teacher training in Manchester where he became a firm Manchester City football fan, thoroughly enjoying their success over recent seasons. But, typical of the man, he never gloated as they eclipsed their great rivals across the city. He ed to Northern Ireland and secured a teaching post in St Patrick’s, Banbridge, his subjects being PE and history. Around that time, he married Liz and they settled in her beloved Tandragee. As he entered his s, MS was diagnosed – an extreme form of the illness – and he never really enjoyed respite as it progressed over the years. But he never let it get the better of him. During the early years, he played drums in a band that toured the province and also acted as a DJ at ious s – he had a comprehensive collection of LPs of the s-s and he particularly enjoyed music. And before MS struck, he was a talented sportsman, playing football for Mid-Ulster teams like Borough United and Red Lion, and GAA for Clann na Gael in Lurgan and up to minor Armagh standard. He used his disability in many positive ways, campaigning for those confined to a wheelchair. For example, he harried the local councilto make Tandragee more disability friendly, with footpath and business access. And when St Patrick’s Roman Catholic Cathedral in Armagh was in the throes of refurbishment during the s, he became “an uninvited volunteer” to ensure that the architects created total access for the disabled. His humour and his sense of social commitment never left him, and while his large extended family mourn his passing, they are grateful that Finbarr left behind a legacy of caring and a social conscience that were an example to anyone with whom he came in contact. Finbarr also produced the parish Bulletin for St James RC Church in Tandragee and it was there that Parish Priest Fr Michael Woods conducted the Requiem Mass.Photographer found guilty of voyeurism Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\" Fr Woods said, “Finbarr lived in friendship with his Lord and Saviour and bore his  years of illness with a positive and serene calmness. Even from his wheelchair, he participated in liturgical le and when I had computer problems, he was the man to call upon.” He added that the past few months had been particularly dficult for Finbarr, Liz and family and that God’s call was not unexpected.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre.

In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
