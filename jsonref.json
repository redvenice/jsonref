Sunbathers...Share this articleThe Chronicles of Narnia star has four springer iels which appeared in an opera music video she directed last year.In planning documents for the proposed build, agent Henry Allan, of In-Built design, said: \u0027My client\u0027s brief was to increase the size of the kitchen and dining areas, while catering to the requirements of a large modern family.          The Oscar-winning actor wants to build a new kitchen, dining area and dog room at the rear of her B-listed property in Nairnshire\u0027The different habitation areas allow for a natural flow of the family.\u0027Therefore creating an inclusive family environment while removing the eyesore of the hotchpotch of flat roofed buildings on the east gable. He added that the new extension would give both the actress and her neighbours more privacy. He said: \u0027The benefit of this to my client is that it gives a degree of privacy, as the houses adjacent are built on the upward slope and thus have a clear view into the rear garden from their ground floor windows.\u0027Likewise providing privacy for neighbouring houses. The evolution of the extension from many sketched schemes fit the requirement of my client.  The new plans come after the previously proposed renovation was described as \u0027brutal\u0027 and \u0027brash\u0027 by opponents\u0027From the large, bright, airy, and relaxed feel of the kitchen and dining areas with the juxtaposition to the more formal rooms and the back vestibule, where everyday activities can be carried out without disturbing the rest of the house.\u0027One of the features of the proposals is the mono-pitched roofs. The benefit of this is a high ceiling, in keeping with the rest of the house.\u0027In summary, the new extension with it\u0027s mono-pitched roofs gives a contemporary, clean and defined appearance, which enhances, without detracting from the original building and replaces a substandard garage extension with a carefully considered and sympathetic addition, which would contribute greatly to the function of this much loved and painstakingly restored family home.\u0027Highland Council will consider the plans later this year.Her home is category B listed - a Scottish categorisation which means a building is considered to be of regional or local importance.             The old plans slammed by locals: Her plans also included a new \u0027snug\u0027 room, a wet room, a pantry and a terrace           Her original proposals were to demolish an existing garage extension and outbuildings at her home to create the new kitchen and dining area and a room for her pets (the draft of which is mocked up in the bottom left hand side of the image) "},{"url":null,"title":"Former RHOBH star Eden Sassoon unveils new look face lift","story":"    Fresh faced! Eden Sassoon has unveiled her stunning and youthful new look after undergoing a $25,000 AuraLyft  face-lift last month   Before and after: Sassoon, 45, says the $25,000 procedure - dubbed the Ferrari of face-lifts - has left her looking and feeling much younger. The end result, pictured right, is undoubtedly impressive with no visible scars or marks  Sassoon admits she wasn\u0027t happy with her \u0027extra skin\u0027 and neck that she had tried to tighten by doing exercise           DailyMailTV captured the moment Sassoon went under the knife. Above, a surgeon peels back her face and slices chunks of skin away  Our cameras captured the graphic moment a surgeon peeled back the star\u0027s face and sliced chunks of skin away.But while footage of the three-hour procedure may be gruesome, the end result is undoubtedly impressive with no visible scars or marks.Eden says the \u0027incredible\u0027 face-lift, performed earlier this month, has truly boosted her confidence.\u0027I look amazing. I feel 24, I\u0027m 45. It\u0027s been an incredible experience. I see myself in the mirror and that\u0027s me,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I\u0027ve been exercising a lot. I feel like I feel as if this is how I should have always been.\u0027I showed up there 45 minutes early, I was dancing and singing. From the moment we decided to do this I\u0027ve been ready. I\u0027ve wanted to do this for the last four or five years.\u0027The AuraLyft face-lift uses the same technique as facial reconstruction for cancer patients.The procedure was conducted by Dr. Ben Talei, one of the most respected facial plastic surgeons in the country, who was featured in September on CBS show The Doctors.His state of the art Beverly Hills Center for Plastic \u0026amp Laser Surgery specializes in advanced face-lift procedures, rhinoplasty, eyebrow lifts, non-surgical skin rejuvenation, among other things.          Pre-surgery: The procedure was conducted by Dr Ben Talei, one of the most respected facial plastic surgeons in the country, who was featured in September on CBS show The Doctors          The AuraLyft technique requires only a local anesthetic to the patient\u0027s face, meaning Eden was awake during the procedure           Eden admits she was able to experience every moment. \u0027I was lying there and in my own head I\u0027m thinking, Wow, this is really an interesting experience. I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there,\u0027 she said The AuraLyft technique requires only a local anesthetic to the patient\u0027s face, which reduces recovery time and cost, but also meant Eden was awake during the procedure as our camera rolled.And the blonde beauty says she experienced every moment.\u0027I was really nervous about that,\u0027 Eden confessed. \u0027But everyone in the room was so incredibly full of love and positive energy that I felt so safe. I could hear them speak and I could feel them turn my neck and pull this way, and I could make noises. If I really tried, I probably could have opened my eyes and spoke.\u0027I was lying there and in my own head I\u0027m thinking, Wow, this is really an interesting experience. I really don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, but oh it feels tighter there. I could feel him touch my leg every sort of 30, 45 seconds and it, and it gave me this sense of calm. Not once was I scared or thought I\u0027m not doing this.\u0027Eden says she\u0027s excited to watch the footage of Dr Talei slicing her face.\u0027I cannot wait to watch that video,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I watched somebody else after while I was in bed healing and I\u0027m like, oh my God, and that\u0027s what he just did to my face? He\u0027s so talented, the work that he\u0027s doing is spectacular, I want to sit in on everyone\u0027s surgery and watch.\u0027The former Real Housewives star grew up around beauty, and said the odd \u0027nip and tuck\u0027 here and there was normal in the Sassoon household, adding that she believes as the face of a beauty business, you\u0027ve got to look your best.\u0027I was always complaining about my neck and this loose skin. I have these fitness studios, Pilates studios, and as Vidal Sassoon\u0027s daughter I was raised that this was something that was okay,\u0027 Eden told DailyMailTV. \u0027If I can work out everyday and push my body to a limit to tighten itself, why isn\u0027t this tightening?          DailyMailTV cameras captured the three-hour surgery which Sassoon admits she\u0027s excited to watch           Recovery: Sassoon poses with Dr Ben Talei while giving two thumbs up post surgery           Dr Talei said the procedure on Eden was a \u0027zero-tension lift\u0027, requiring no stitches, but took off a lot of skin\u0027Being raised in the beauty and health business, there\u0027s a certain expectation on you to look good. But I think it\u0027s more of an internal job. I wasn\u0027t happy with this extra skin. I wasn\u0027t happy with my neck.\u0027And thanks to Dr Talei that\u0027s now fixed.\u0027AuraLyft is completely different and the best type to do on anybody,\u0027 Dr Talei said.\u0027Without the need for fat grafting or fillers it gives the maximum that any surgery can give you in terms of rejuvenation of the face and neck while also providing the absolute most natural outcome from the top of the brow to the bottom of the neck.\u0027Dr Talei said the procedure on Eden was a \u0027zero-tension lift\u0027, requiring no stitches, but took off a lot of skin.\u0027She\u0027s only mid-40s and she had a shocking amount of laxity in the skin, and that\u0027s usually the case for someone who\u0027s getting a face-lift a little younger. We took off enough skin to form a wallet, a woman\u0027s purse.\u0027She came back the next day and took the head wrap off, and already she looked great. We\u0027re doing a lot things now in the operation to prevent bruising and make sure they heal as quickly as possible, so she looked good in the first couple of days. Now about three weeks later she\u0027s doing Pilates and already looking great in photos.\u0027Dr Talei claims the results are so refined, \u0027that nobody, no matter how close they are to the patient, knows they\u0027ve had surgery.\u0027Eden said she wanted a more natural-looking face-lift, after getting compliments over her natural look compared to her \u0027glammed-up\u0027 appearance in Real Housewives.\u0027There are eyes on you and everyone\u0027s gonna have their own judgment. I try to not let that in because it\u0027s a lot,\u0027 she said.

The two remain on friendly terms but Sassoon reveals she\u0027s \u0027back on the market\u0027 \u0027Having done the Housewives season, I see people and they\u0027re like, God you\u0027re so beautiful in person, you wore so much makeup. And I did, I tried to glam it up.\u0027If you\u0027re going to get the real me, you\u0027re not going to get a lot of makeup, you\u0027re going to get hair really natural, you\u0027re going to get my tattoos,\u0027 she added. \u0027I like to be physically fit and I want just a healthy, clean, glowy look. I think there\u0027s a stigma with TV, that you play the part.\u0027Eden says that now she\u0027s back in the dating game and looking and feeling younger, she hopes to bag a younger man.\u0027We still have to play this game and oh my God I\u0027m exhausted. But now that I look 10 to 15 years younger, I can kind of play the game with the youngsters,\u0027 she said.The Real Housewife hinted that she already had a \u0027quarterback\u0027 in her love life, but added that she is still enjoying \u0027a view on the bench\u0027, and is very much looking to score.The health and fitness entrepreneur said she wanted to televise her face-lift to remove the mystery of the process for other women, showing them how it really works.\u0027So many people want to know how and why some women look like this, but everyone doesn\u0027t tell the truth. I\u0027m 100 per cent open and honest about it,\u0027 she said.          New face, new me: Sassoon debuted her youthful new look last weekend at the 2019 Pre-GRAMMY event presented by OK!, Star, In Touch and Life \u0026amp Style magazines in LA  The reality star is so happy with her surgery, that she\u0027s even recommending Dr Talei to her daughter for plastic surgery.\u0027My daughter is someone who is a beautiful young girl and struggles a little bit with a facial feature,\u0027 she revealed. \u0027And because as a kid I did the same thing, I can\u0027t say no.

He did not specify howA lawyer for AMI meanwhile described the source on Sunday by stating: \u0027The story was given to The National Enquirer by a reliable source that had been giving information to the National Enquirer for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.\u0027                            They were talking marriage. The three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, let’s get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, You’re both pilots and you’ve never landed a 747, but that’s what we’re trying to do here.\u0027                        Michael makes an analogy comparing his sister\u0027s affair to a large plan  His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer recently, with the tabloid also running racy exchanges between Fox Business Network host Charles Payne and Scottie Nell Hughes. American Media defended the emails sent by the National Enquirer\u0027s Chief Content Officer and the firm\u0027s legal team threatening to publish nude photos of Bezos and Sanchez if he did not drop an investigation into how editors learned of the billionaire\u0027s affair.  \u0027American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,\u0027 the company said in a statement released on Friday. \u0027Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\u0027            Cheers: His sister is actually the second person close to Michael whose texts have shown up in The National Enquirer, with Scotty Neal Hughes (above) suffering a similar leakThe American Media board is comprised of four iniduals, including: owner David Pecker Evan Ratner, a partner  at Chatham Asset Management Barry Schwartz, also a partner at at Chatham Asset Management and David R. Hughes, the former executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. Chatham Asset Management has an 80 percent stake in American Media according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, it was revealed on Friday that federal prosecutors were reviewing the emails sent by AMI to Bezos in order to determine if the company violated its immunity deal by blackmailing Bezos. Bezos meanwhile said that he believed Saudia Arabia played a role in AMI\u0027s decision last week.\u0027Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is “apoplectic” about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\u0027 wrote Bezos in a post on Thursday.\u0027A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation.\u0027When asked if there was any Saudi involvement in the leaking of Bezos\u0027 texts on Friday, the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir said \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 and then a short while later said \u0027no.\u0027   “My Only Goal Has Been to Protect Jeff and Lauren”: Michael Sanchez, Suspected Bezos Leaker, Supplies His Own Theory About the Affair, the Enquirer, Some Below-the-Belt Selfies, and “a Legendary Romance” | Vanity Fair"},{"url":null,"title":"Feds tell Alfonso Ribeiro copyright Carlton moves","story":"    Ribeiro, pictured on DWTS in 2014, has been told he cannot copyright his moves for the \u0027Carlton\u0027 dance which he is suing creators of Fortnite video game overA hearing on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 18.Ribeiro\u0027s dance was popularized through his character, Carlton Banks, on the 1990s sitcom.He joins several rappers suing Epic Games over dances used in Fortnite.A suit was filed against the company - which developed the wildly popular multiplayer port - in December last year.Ribeiro claims the video game included a new dance move for it\u0027s characters called the \u0027Fresh emote\u0027 on January 2, 2018 and it\u0027s a \u0027carbon copy\u0027 of the famous movements he came up with for the Will Smith vehicle.The hilarious choreography includes his arms being swung wildly back and forth as he shuffles his feet in a two-step.A computer graphic character for the video game does a spot on impression.

Khashoggi, a contributor to the Washington Post, was killed on October 2 shortly after entering the kingdom\u0027s consulate (pictured) in what Riyadh called a \u0027rogue\u0027 operation          Citing police sources, Turkish media said the 59-year-old\u0027s dismembered body was carried from the consulate where he was murdered in cases and bags to the consul general\u0027s residence where his remains were burntDespite Turkey\u0027s investigation looking at the kingdom\u0027s consulate in Istanbul, the consul\u0027s residence and several other locations, Mr Khashoggi\u0027s remains have not been found.Mr Khashoggi\u0027s killing has severely strained ties between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, although Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has good ties with the Saudi monarch, King Salman.Erdogan has said Mr Khashoggi\u0027s killing was ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership and has repeatedly called on Saudi officials to identify a \u0027local cooperator\u0027 involved in the killing. Riyadh has rejected accusations that the crown prince was involved.Footage from the police report shown on Turkish televisions showed a man believed to be a Mr Khashoggi impersonator walking alongside a man police say is the \u0027local cooperator\u0027 in the case. The identity of the man was not immediately clear.Last week a UN human rights expert said Mr Khashoggi was murdered in a \u0027brutal and premeditated killing\u0027 carried out by Saudi officials. Turkish officials have been frustrated by what they say is a lack of cooperation by Riyadh and have called for an international inquiry.           The images feature three men carrying five suitcases and two large black bags into the home of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, Turkey          There has been speculation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (centre) ordered the hit of Mr Khashoggi but Riyadh has absolved the de facto leader of any blameKhashoggi\u0027s killing  provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of Crown Prince bin Salman, previously admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive.  CCTV footage emerged in December allegedly showing Jamal Khashoggi\u0027s body parts being carried into Saudi Arabia\u0027s consul residence in bags and suitcases on the day he was murdered.The images feature three men carrying five suitcases and two large black bags into the home of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, Turkey.The residence lies a short distance from the Saudi consulate where Khashoggi was butchered in a killing that has tested Riyadh\u0027s relations with the West.Saudi Arabia has also repeatedly rejected Turkish demands to extradite suspects connected to the murder of the journalist, a critic of the crown prince. The journalist had decided to leave his native Saudi Arabia for the US in September 2017, but was lured to the embassy in Istanbul on in October this year to collect papers for his upcoming marriage. Listening devices planted inside the building by Turkish intelligence captured the \u0027kill squad\u0027 planning the murder in the days before and carrying it out.A report by the Washington Post, to which Khashoggi was a contributing columnist, says that when he arrived at the consulate a member of the team asked \u0027whether he would take tea\u0027. Shortly afterwards, a member of the Saudi \u0027kill squad\u0027 chillingly told the journalist he would be \u0027going back to Saudi Arabia\u0027, before injecting him with a lethal dose of sedative. Khashoggi\u0027s final gasps for air are audible on the tape recordings, officials told the Washington Post.They added that there was nothing to suggest that the team had any intent to take Khashoggi alive.Further reports quoting those who have listened to the recordings claim Khashoggi\u0027s last words were to tell his killers \u0027I can\u0027t breathe\u0027.Just moments after his gasps faded, the silence on the tape gives way to the sound of an electric saw, consistent with reports that Khashoggi\u0027s body was dismembered.

Admiral Sir John Balchin was aboard HMS Victory during the ship\u0027s final voyage in October 1744 and he was long thought to be responsible for its sinking, due to poor navigation. However, in 2009,  Odyssey Marine Exploration announced it had discovered Victory, 62 mile away from where it was thought to have sunk. This suggested that a fierce storm rather than a navigational error had been behind the sinking          Bringing Victory\u0027s treasures to the surface would be a costly exercise - one companies like Odyssey would usually fund through the sale of artifacts. This has prompted a tense legal battle over whether the wreck should be allowed to lay undisturbed or should instead be brought to the surface and taken to a museumIn addition to the cannon, rigging, glass bottle fragments and remains of the hull and anchors were discovered.But a massive gold hoard rumoured to be aboard the Victory has not been found.There is still more to be learned from the ship, Mr Sheldon said but the question remains - should that be done through surveying the site underwater, or should Victory be excavated?One man who is convinced Victory\u0027s artefacts are best taken out of harm\u0027s way is Dr Sean Kingsley a marine archaeologist for the Maritime Heritage Foundation (MHF), which was gifted the wreck site in 2012.He would like to see artefacts brought up and displayed in a UK museum.\u0027The government believes this unique wreck can be managed untouched, 80km offshore, in one of the world\u0027s busiest sea lanes.\u0027An irreplaceable piece of British history ends up abandoned, out of sight and mind, with the government\u0027s stamp of approval.\u0027The site is also at risk of damage from fishing trawlers, erosion and illegal salvage, something noted by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 2014.While the extent of threat to the wreck from fishing and looting is disputed, Dr Kingsley is concerned a 2018 decision to put the foundation\u0027s initial 2014 \u0027research and rescue\u0027 application on hold will mean the site could be further threatened.While there is a consensus on the historical importance of the wreck, not everyone in the archaeological world agrees with the Maritime Heritage Foundation\u0027s plans for the site.\u0027This is basically a grave - this is the last resting place of 1,100 British sailors and it should not be disturbed lightly,\u0027 said Robert Yorke, chairman of the Joint Nautical Archaeology Policy Committee.

Not that she has ever made one, but she loves to collect them on her journeys around the globe. Two of these finds appear at the outset of The Journey of Things, her new exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield. For Odundo, teapots represent how ceramics are central to culture and community. From China to England, people gather around them to socialise. And yet, as these examples demonstrate, a traditional Chinese teapot with its dark exterior and weighty clay is very different from a Staffordshire stoneware iteration.Under its little lid, a teapot encapsulates all the things Odundo loves about ceramics. They have an unusual form, they can be made using various techniques and materials and they are functional. But, above all, they are objects infused with centuries of tradition. These interests are the driving force behind the exhibition, which unites more than 50 of Odundo’s works plus a large collection of ceramics, photographs, paintings, textiles and sculptures that have influenced her during her 40-year career. Although there are some important names attached to this show – Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Edgar Degas – it is the object itself that Odundo values. Many of the pieces are by unknown artists.The four gallery spaces feature large concrete-effect plinths in the same tone as the floor, like mountains raised up from the ground. Designed by architect Farshid Moussavi, the plinths are set at a reasonable height and stepped against the walls, ensuring we connect with most of the works eye to eye. Many of Odundo’s signature black-and-orange burnished pots congregate in the centre of the room in small groups. With their curvaceous centres and elongated necks, her creations are reminiscent of the human body, and, by lifting them up, it is like meeting a group of friends. In recognising a rounded stomach in a base or spotting a nose or waistline in the neck of a vase, we begin to consider ourselves as vessels, too, capable of carrying ideas, traditions, cultures and, in some cases, a child. “For me, the pieces contain what it is to be human,” says Odundo.Early in Odundo’s career, potter Michael Cardew encouraged her to return to Africa (she is originally from Kenya) to engage with African ceramic practices. During her time at Cardew’s pottery training centre in Abuja, Nigeria, she learned the Gbari way of handling clay, forming the basis of her creative process. But she also identified the singular connection between the Abuja community and the objects they were crafting. She has travelled the world and visited museums to explore the function and cultural value of these pieces. Many of the works in show exemplify this. A Ghanaian akua’ba, or fertility doll, reveals how Asante people ushered in the conception of future generations a figurine from Mali details how androgyny is important to the Dogon religion, and a lekythos from ancient Greece demonstrates how oil was used in funerary rites in antiquity.There is layer on layer of history and skill in this exhibition, which s 3,000 years. Detailed curatorial notes guide us through Odundo’s interest in dance, spirituality, the female form, vernacular crafts and much more. The level of information could feel overwhelming, but spending some time in the presence of these spectacular objects will ensure you never look at your coffee cup in quite the same way again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f731609dfe86bbc7bbf0024b57a5b6592e8e7341/0_173_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dddd822a836e6ceb9df7eef99ad76e2","title":"the black cowboys of mississippi in pictures","story":"The sub-culture of black cowboys in the Mississippi delta is the subject of an ongoing project by the photographer Rory Doyle.

Given the extent of the cuts – £950m has been sliced from the total budget since 2010, with the amount falling from £2.5bn to £1.6bn in real terms – critics were unimpressed. While the extra money can be expected to ease the situation for a small minority of litigants, for the majority nothing will change.There is a clear public interest in understanding how the courts have been affected by cuts, especially in handling disputes over housing, immigration or benefits. One of the most serious areas of concern is family law. Parents are entitled to legal aid in care cases, but not in disputes between ex-partners over access (unless they have proof of domestic violence), meaning that some simply give up. In 2017, more than a third of family court hearings saw both parties appearing without representation.Last month the Liberal Democrat former justice minister Tom McNally told the  that he believes it was right for the coalition to seek to reduce the amount of taxpayer-funded litigation and promote mediation instead. But as the level of cuts has increased far beyond the original target of £350m, the evidence of unintended and harmful effects has increased. This makes it all the more essential that it is possible to scrutinise what is happening in family courts. Difficult questions about the reporting of family law must be addressed. There are very tough restrictions on what can be reported in cases involving children. That is understandable. No one wants a free-for-all. But it is becoming clearer that more transparency is needed. Ten years ago, journalists won the right to report on family court proceedings under certain conditions. But the promised new era of openness never materialised. There are a variety of reasons for this, some of them good ones. Reporting on family law is difficult, and resources are limited. When deciding what information can be published, judges must balance the right to privacy with the right of free expression.Sometimes those deciding a child’s future make mistakes. Judges may also err in deciding what may be said about a case. On Friday the journalist and  contributor Louise Tickle succeeded in her application at the court of appeal to have a reporting restriction order ruled unlawful. The ruling was in the case of a girl who was taken into care by Southampton city council between the ages of two and five, before her mother successfully challenged a placement order and the child was returned to her. The appeal was granted on grounds that the balancing exercise, between privacy and free expression, had not been carried out. The lack of scrutiny resulting from such judgments is particularly concerning at a time when the number of children in care continues to rise. The most recent official figures show 75,420 looked-after children in England, up from 60,000 in 2008. One study last year showed the number of newborn babies removed from their mothers had doubled over the same period. This matters not only to the iniduals involved, but to society more broadly. When the system gets it wrong, we need to know it has done so and understand why. When it gets it right, showing how it reached a decision in a complicated case builds vital public trust."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb65d31cf82a811802a409cc5769384b735445f/0_439_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f702e21b4d575e16e5e72d6381c3bd","title":"young climate change greta thunberg children","story":"Such is the upside-down, topsy-turvy state of our world, that the children are now the adults and the adults are the children.

I’m the mother of five, grandmother of nine. I know a temper tantrum when I see one.”But perhaps these comparisons are unfair – not to Trump or the Brexiters, but to children. Because while Trump has invented a wholly fake emergency – there is no threat of imminent invasion by migrants on the US’s southern border – and while the threat of a no-deal crashout from the EU is, if all too real, entirely avoidable via a simple vote of the House of Commons, it has fallen to children to point to the emergency that is neither fake nor easily averted. It has fallen to those so young they are not trusted to decide what they can eat or when they can go to bed to sound the alarm about the crisis that matters most: the crisis of the climate.What are we to make of today’s strike by schoolchildren, in Britain and across the world, part of a rapidly growing movement aiming for a global walkout of kids on 15 March? How should we react to a phenomenon that began with a single child, a Stockholm teenager by the name of Greta Thunberg, who skipped class one Friday last August to sit in protest on the steps of the Swedish parliament, and which today saw primary-aged children, as well as teenagers, following her lead, wielding placards as they marched in Parliament Square and the streets of dozens of British towns and cities?At first sight the reaction surely has to be one of unfettered joy. Many will share the enthusiasm of those veteran environmentalists hailing this as the most exciting, most hopeful development they have witnessed in decades of campaigning. A young generation so easily caricatured as disconnected and self-absorbed, heads tilted permanently downward towards their phones, Instagramming pictures of themselves, are instead taking a moral lead.Liberal parents have been beside themselves with pride, bundling up their little ones in scarves and gloves as they watch them bunk off school to save the planet. I suspect there will be many  readers who shared the dilemma I myself faced this week. Not whether to allow their kids to miss lessons in an exam year for the higher cause of tackling climate change: that one was a no-brainer. No, the dilemma I have in mind is rather more finely balanced. Should the conscientious liberal parent reveal their excitement about seeing their son or daughter take a stand, or should they pretend to disapprove, thereby supplying their young with the thrill of principled rebellion?Teachers have grappled with the tension between the law, which says that children must be in school, and the obvious truth that this is a “teachable moment”, a learning experience. In fact, the law says children must be in school unless there are “exceptional circumstances”. As the country’s sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, told me while marvelling at child protesters on the streets in her Brighton constituency: “When David Attenborough is warning that the future of civilisation is at risk, that counts as ‘exceptional circumstances’.” It’s not just the case against carbon emissions that this moment can teach. Thunberg is also demonstrating the power of the inidual act. It’s so easy to feel impotent given the sheer scale of the climate crisis. But Thunberg, whose Twitter bio describes her as a “16-year-old climate activist with Asperger”, is the living embodiment of the case against defeatism. Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg, an early and tireless environmental advocate, is right to say that the #FridaysForFuture movement is “not the first great change to begin with the action of just one person”: from Abraham onwards, our history and tradition is full of people who, alone at first, changed the world.All of these are reasons to be heartened. And yet, there is a harsher truth to face. These demonstrations by the young are a terrible indictment of the rest of us. They are a mark of our failure. Their action is only necessary because we have failed to act. As one placard at the Belgian protests told politicians: “I’ll do my homework when you do yours.”This week marked the first anniversary of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, a massacre of 17 that led to a mass movement of young Americans demanding gun control. That effort too is a product of failure, children having to act because adults have failed in their basic duty: to protect the young. There was great poignancy in Thunberg’s words to the UN climate change conference in Poland in December: “You are not mature enough to tell it like it is – even that burden you leave to us children.” Any delight, pride or joy we feel in these protests has to be tempered by the realisation of the adult world’s failure.There’s a last question, one that feels unfair given the idealism written on the faces of these children. Will this effort work? The sceptic will say not, speculating that the attention of the young is a fickle thing, that this will be – as parents have told their kids through the ages – just a phase. They might also add that the powerful are very skilled at co-opting, and thereby often neutralising, the young: witness Thunberg’s recent invitation to Davos.I’m more hopeful than that. There are signs that the climate crisis is finally getting the attention it deserves. Watch would-be Democratic challengers to Trump in 2020 fall over themselves to embrace the “green New Deal”, a vision of transforming the economy to save the planet with appeal beyond those who have previously tended to prioritise the environment. Watch too the way the Extinction Rebellion has captured the imagination or the reaction to news that the world’s insect population is plummeting, a destruction that threatens the collapse of nature itself.Page warns that humans are exceptionally bad at spotting slow, long-term dangers: “We’re wired for sabre-toothed tigers,” he says. We can find it hard to envisage the future. The only way we can visualise it, perhaps, is through our children. When they tell us we are burning their future, as they are now, we have to overcome our shame at having failed them – and listen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a047b8c4b3e5e6d73f7c2d12043a4c00d9ea6a0/0_959_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de0007038803835df526ae556c59abc4","title":"hozier webchat post your questions now take me to church","story":"The singer of Take Me to Church will be answering your questions from 1-2pm GMT on Monday 18 FebruaryIt’s hard to believe it’s more than five years since Hozier released his debut single, Take Me to Church, that mammoth rebuke of organised religion that ruled 2013.

But it did so by challenging Hollywood expectationsThis week, two minutes of video struck both terror and cheer into the hearts of parents worldwide. The dread, for those with small children, is prompted by the endless viewings, deluge of merchandise and earsplitting singing that lie in store with the release of a follow-up to Disney’s blockbuster Frozen later this year. The trailer offered the first, teasing glimpse of that sequel.The original is the highest grossing musical and animation ever, earning $1.3bn at the box office since its release six years ago and vast sums via associated paraphernalia. No wonder Disney wouldn’t let it go. It is “a generational set text”, wrote a  critic: it is to its younger and mostly but by no means solely female audience what Star Wars was to teenage boys. Very loosely inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story, it follows a snow queen who freezes the land and a brave young girl who risks her life to bring back the warmth.This is a Disney princess movie that inverts or demolishes most of the tropes of that genre, and does so well and wittily enough that many will welcome its sequel. Though there had already been a broader shift away from classic fairytale storylines, Frozen proved beyond question that it is possible to make a hugely popular movie that eschews stereotypes and takes self-realisation, and the love between sisters Elsa and Anna, as seriously as romance.The parameters of princesshood were once so narrow that The Little Mermaid, in which the heroine is literally voiceless for much of the action, was considered progress. It is not coincidental that Frozen was the first Disney full-length animated feature directed by a woman, Jennifer Lee, and that Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who co-wrote the songs with her husband, shares her feminist sympathies.Frozen has its disappointments: notably the Barbiefication of Elsa as she comes into her own. Unlike the more recent Disney heroine Moana, the sisters are white and wasp-waisted. But this is a movie that, as those campaigning for a girlfriend for Elsa noted, embraces difference and shows the damage caused by shame and concealment. These are princesses who do the rescuing, learn to love their power, and wonder whether they’re “elated or gassy”. The handsome prince who sweeps you off your feet may be a frog. The companion who has your back is a better bet, but not the be-all and end-all. Your relationship with yourself, or your sister, may be more important. Frozen doesn’t just pass the Bechdel test with flying colours. It even rejects the Manichaean worldview of classic Disney movies: “People make bad choices if they’re mad, or scared, or stressed.” In another movie Elsa would be the villain.We will soon find out whether what comes after Frozen’s happy ever after proves as pleasing to audiences. It will be a relief if the sequel lives up to the boldness of the original – and better still if Hollywood takes note of its lessons when producing movies for grown-ups, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e456eb132857477fceb92523f4f012c992b40b36/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18120218794dc7f8dfb945337579e943","title":"gazprom abu dhabi alternative guide champions league ties last 16","story":"Other states, hedge funds and a tax haven also feature in our look at how club owners and partners stack up in the last 16Owned by its members.Value of club £548m, 15th in Forbes: The Business of Soccer (see note on sourcing)Turnover £210m, 16th in Deloitte Football Money League 201718 (see note on sourcing) Net profitloss -£9.5m loss (2017)Partners: The Russian government at one remove.

She was the sixth woman to study law at Oxford University, reading jurisprudence at St Hugh’s College. She completed her studies in 1911 with first class marks, yet she didn’t formally graduate because women at the time couldn’t be awarded degrees.In 1913, Bebb and three other women – Karin Costelloe, Maud Ingram and Lucy Frances Nettlefold – applied to the Law Society to sit the preliminary examinations needed before becoming a solicitor. They refused their applications and returned their fees, because women couldn’t be admitted as solicitors or barristers.Bebb and her colleagues took an action against the Law Society, claiming that it should allow them to take the exams and seeking a declaration that a woman was a “person” within the meaning of the Solicitors Act 1843. Section two of the act said: “No person shall act as an attorney or solicitor … unless such person shall after the passing of this act be admitted and enrolled and otherwise duly qualified as an attorney or solicitor.”Section 48 meanwhile said that “every word importing masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to a female as well as male … unless in any of the cases aforesaid it be otherwise specially provided.”The women were represented by Liberal politician and leading barrister Stanley Buckmaster KC. Buckmaster argued that simple statutory interpretation meant that women could be solicitors, relying on section 48. He also argued that there were precedents for women working as lawyers, even if they were not called “solicitors”.Despite the provisions of the act, Joyce ruled against them, stating that there were no examples of female solicitors or precedent for allowing them to become solicitors essentially, he argued that women could not be solicitors because no women had ever been one, and said it was up to parliament to change the law, not the court.They appealed to the Court of Appeal, and lost again. The court stated it was bound by “long uniform and interrupted usage, which we ought … to be very loth to depart from” – that as only men had been solicitors, women could not be.The case failed, but the women had made their point and won public support. They did not appeal to the House of Lords, then the highest court in the land, but put their energy into campaigning for law reform, with support from a number of male MPs.The impact of the first world war and the increased awareness of women’s rights due to the suffrage movement meant the time had come for change. The Law Society voted to admit women and in 1919 parliament finally passed the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, which declared: “A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from … entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation, or admission to any incorporated society.”In 1922, Ingram, Mary Elizabeth Pickup, Mary Elaine Sykes and Carrie Morrison became the first women to pass the Law Society exams. Morrison became the first woman admitted as a solicitor later that year. Bebb herself did not benefit from the law change: she died the year before, aged 31, from complications during childbirth.Dana Denis-Smith, founder of the First 100 Years project which charts the journey of women in the law, says it was an important case. “It showed how the courts used precedent in order to maintain the status quo, and demonstrated the inflexibility and limits of the law,” she says.As Erika Rackley and Rosemary Auchmuty write in the book Women’s Legal Landmarks, the case highlights the “decades-long resistance of the male lawyers, MPs and judges to the idea of allowing women to be lawyers, and the need for feminist campaigners to strategise on all fronts to shift attitudes”.There is still work to be done to achieve real equality in law.

Asprey also has his own stem cells injected into his face and genitals, freezes himself in a home cryotherapy chamber, and bathes in infrared light. The point, he explains, is to use “science, biology, and self-experimentation to take control of and upgrade your body, your mind, and your life”.Which prompted Edith Zimmerman, writing on The Cut, to ask a pertinent question: why? She conceded that the same might be asked of her exercise routine. “What are we doing? And why? Am I afraid of death? Of ageing? Am I avoiding the present, always thinking of how good it’s going to be, soon?”It’s a good question, and there’s a clue to the deeper issue in Asprey’s use of the word “upgrade”. Speaking to  Weekend last year, the millionaire biohacker Serge Faguet – who takes 60 supplements a day, and won’t have kids because they’re “not a good return on investment” – used identical language: “Ultimately, the real value is being able to upgrade yourself.” But what does that even mean? Upgrading, like “optimisation”, is one of those words implying a sort of all-round “betterness”, or generally increased efficiency.But there’s no such thing as general betterness or efficiency. You’re always improving at something specific, usually at the expense of something else, whether you acknowledge it or not. For biohackers, that often seems to mean living longer – Asprey’s aiming for 180 – but that’s not a very satisfying answer. Live longer for what? To spend more time biohacking?There’s a cynical reading of all this, in which the ultimate beneficiary is always and only The Man: while the super-wealthy might biohack for fun, for most of us the main effect of boosting energy and focus, or learning how to sleep more efficiently, is to become a better cog in the corporate machine. (See also “productivity”, another idea that masquerades as an end in itself, when in fact it’s always productivity for some goal – frequently your employer’s bottom line.)I don’t think that’s universally true, though. If you care about your work, time with your family, or the local volunteering project you’re involved with, it makes perfect sense to want to do it with more energy, even sometimes more efficiently. And personally I’d rather like to live a few decades more than my official life expectancy. Rather, the point is to know – or at least to ask – why you’re doing it: because there’s always a “why”, whether it’s your own or not.To adapt a timeworn adage, it would be terrible to spend your life upgrading your climbing gear, only to reach the summit and realise you’d been scaling the wrong mountain.In her new book Counterproductive, Melissa Gregg charts how “personal productivity” came to dominate the modern workplace, leading to isolation and burnout.

We had nothing to lose and everything to gain in writing this.”When Beats saw the scripts “that sealed it for us”, the spokesperson said. “They were clearly the product of not using the right voices to make this show.”The group was keen to stress that it did not want the show to be cancelled. It is calling for the BBC and Twenty Twenty to work with British East Asians in the industry to create “a series that is truly progressive in its representation of British East Asian family life because it succeeds in humanising them”.The spokesperson said: “The world needs to be exposed to a realistic, nuanced and normalised representation of British East Asian people growing up.”A BBC spokesperson said: “We’re really proud of our track record in making erse and culturally relevant output for our young audience. We believe they deserve the best, which is why we work hard to find the most talented writers and producers to create the most entertaining and engaging shows.“We always seek guidance, advice and expert input for culturally sensitive content. We’re still in the development stages of Living With the Lams and so the editorial process is ongoing.

By  Daniel ImmerwahrThere aren’t many historical episodes more firmly lodged in the United States’s national memory than the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is one of only a few events that many people in the country can put a date to: 7 December 1941, the “date which will live in infamy,” as Franklin D Roosevelt put it. Hundreds of books have been written about it – the Library of Congress holds more than 350. And Hollywood has made movies, from the critically acclaimed From Here to Eternity, starring Burt Lancaster, to the critically derided Pearl Harbor, starring Ben Affleck.But what those films don’t show is what happened next. Nine hours after Japan attacked the territory of Hawaii, another set of Japanese planes came into view over another US territory, the Philippines. As at Pearl Harbor, they dropped their bombs, hitting several air bases, to devastating effect.The attack on Pearl Harbor was just that – an attack. Japan’s bombers struck, retreated and never returned. Not so in the Philippines. There, the initial air raids were followed by more raids, then by invasion and conquest. Sixteen million Filipinos – US nationals who saluted the stars and stripes and looked to FDR as their commander in chief – fell under a foreign power.Contrary to popular memory, the event familiarly known as “Pearl Harbor” was in fact an all-out lightning strike on US and British holdings throughout the Pacific. On a single day, the Japanese attacked the US territories of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, Midway Island and Wake Island. They also attacked the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and they invaded Thailand.At first, “Pearl Harbor” was not the way most people referred to the bombings. “Japs bomb Manila, Hawaii” was the headline in one New Mexico paper “Japanese Planes Bomb Honolulu, Island of Guam” in another in South Carolina. Sumner Welles, FDR’s undersecretary of state, described the event as “an attack upon Hawaii and upon the Philippines”. Eleanor Roosevelt used a similar formulation in her radio address on the night of 7 December, when she spoke of Japan “bombing our citizens in Hawaii and the Philippines”.That was how the first draft of FDR’s speech went, too: it presented the event as a “bombing in Hawaii and the Philippines”. Yet Roosevelt toyed with that draft all day, adding things in pencil, crossing other bits out. At some point he deleted the prominent references to the Philippines.Why did Roosevelt demote the Philippines? We don’t know, but it’s not hard to guess. Roosevelt was trying to tell a clear story: Japan had attacked the US. But he faced a problem. Were Japan’s targets considered “the United States”? Legally, they were indisputably US territory. But would the public see them that way? What if Roosevelt’s audience didn’t care that Japan had attacked the Philippines or Guam? Polls taken slightly before the attack show that few in the continental US supported a military defense of those remote territories.Roosevelt no doubt noted that the Philippines and Guam, although technically part of the US, seemed foreign to many. Hawaii, by contrast, was more plausibly “American”. Although it was a territory rather than a state, it was closer to North America and significantly whiter than the others.Yet even when it came to Hawaii, Roosevelt felt a need to massage the point. So, on the morning of his speech, he made another edit. He changed it so that the Japanese squadrons had bombed not the “island of Oahu”, but the “American island of Oahu”. Damage there, Roosevelt continued, had been done to “American naval and military forces”, and “very many American lives” had been lost.An American island, where American lives were lost – that was the point he was trying to make. If the Philippines was being rounded down to foreign, Hawaii was being rounded up to “American”.One reporter in the Philippines described the scene in Manila as the crowds listened to Roosevelt’s speech on the radio. The president spoke of Hawaii and the many lives lost there. Yet he only mentioned the Philippines, the reporter noted, “very much in passing”. Roosevelt made the war “seem to be something close to Washington and far from Manila”.This was not how it looked from the Philippines, where air-raid sirens continued to wail. “To Manilans the war was here, now, happening to us,” the reporter wrote. “And we have no air-raid shelters.”Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam – it wasn’t easy to know how to think about such places, or even what to call them. At the turn of the 20th century, when many were acquired (Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, Hawaii, Wake), their status was clear. They were, as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson unabashedly called them, colonies.That spirit of forthright imperialism didn’t last. Within a decade or two, after passions had cooled, the c-word became taboo. “The word colony must not be used to express the relationship which exists between our government and its dependent peoples,” an official admonished in 1914. Better to stick with a gentler term, used for them all: territories.Yet a striking feature of the overseas territories was how rarely they were even discussed. The maps of the country that most people had in their heads didn’t include places such as the Philippines. Those mental maps imagined the US to be contiguous: a union of states bounded by the Atlantic, the Pacific, Mexico and Canada.That is how most people envision the US today, possibly with the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. The political scientist Benedict Anderson called it the “logo map”, meaning that if the country had a logo, this shape would be it:The problem with the logo map, however, is that it isn’t right. Its shape does not match the country’s legal borders. Most obviously, the logo map excludes Hawaii and Alaska, which became states in 1959 and now appear on virtually all published maps of the country. But it is also missing Puerto Rico, which, although not a state, has been part of the country since 1899. When have you ever seen a map of the US that had Puerto Rico on it? Or American Samoa, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas or any of the other smaller islands that the US has annexed over the years?In 1941, the year Japan attacked, a more accurate picture would have been this:What this map shows is the country’s full territorial extent: the “Greater United States”, as some at the turn of the 20th century called it. In this view, the place normally referred to as the US – the logo map – forms only a part of the country. A large and privileged part, to be sure, yet still only a part. Residents of the territories often call it the “mainland”.On this to-scale map, Alaska isn’t shrunken down to fit into a small inset, as it is on most maps. It is the right size – ie, huge. The Philippines, too, looms large, and the Hawaiian island chain – the whole chain, not just the eight main islands shown on most maps – if superimposed on the mainland would stretch almost from Florida to California.This map also shows territory at the other end of the size scale. In the century before 1940, the US claimed nearly 100 uninhabited islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Some claims were forgotten in time – Washington could be surprisingly lax about keeping tabs. The 22 islands included here are the ones that appeared in official tallies (the census or other governmental reports) in the 1940s. I have represented them as clusters of dots in the bottom left and right corners, although they are so small that they would be invisible if they were drawn to scale.The logo map is not only misleading because it excludes large colonies and pinprick islands alike. It also suggests that the US is a politically uniform space: a union, voluntarily entered into, of states standing on equal footing with one another. But that is not true, and it has never been true. From its founding until the present day, the US has contained a union of American states, as its name suggests. But it has also contained another part: not a union, not states and (for most of its history) not wholly in the Americas – its territories.What is more, a lot of people have lived in that other part. According to the census count for the inhabited territories in 1940, the year before Pearl Harbor, nearly 19 million people lived in the colonies, the great bulk of them in the Philippines. That meant slightly more than one in eight of the people in the US lived outside of the states. For perspective, consider that only about one in 12 was African American. If you lived in the US on the eve of the second world war, in other words, you were more likely to be colonised than black.My point here is not to weigh forms of oppression against one another. In fact, the histories of African Americans and colonised peoples are tightly connected (and sometimes overlapping, as for the African-Caribbeans in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands). The racism that had pervaded the country since slavery also engulfed the territories. Like African Americans, colonial subjects were denied the vote, deprived of the rights of full citizens, called racial epithets, subjected to dangerous medical experiments and used as sacrificial pawns in war. They, too, had to make their way in a country where some lives mattered and others did not.What getting the Greater United States in view reveals is that race has been even more central to US history than is usually supposed. It hasn’t just been about black and white, but about Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan and Chamoru (from Guam), too, among other identities. Race has not only shaped lives, but also the country itself – where the borders went, who has counted as “American”. Once you look beyond the logo map, you see a whole new set of struggles over what it means to inhabit the US.Looking beyond the logo map, however, could be hard for mainlanders. The national maps they used rarely showed the territories. Even the world atlases were confusing. During the second world war, Rand McNally’s Ready Reference Atlas of the World – like many other atlases at the time – listed Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Philippines as “foreign”.A class of seventh-grade girls at the Western Michigan College Training School in Kalamazoo scratched their heads over this. They had been trying to follow the war on their maps. How, they wondered, could the attack on Pearl Harbor have been an attack on the US if Hawaii was foreign? They wrote to Rand McNally to inquire.“Although Hawaii belongs to the United States, it is not an integral part of this country,” the publisher replied. “It is foreign to our continental shores, and therefore cannot logically be shown in the United States proper.”The girls were not satisfied. Hawaii is not an integral part of this country? “We believe this statement is not true,” they wrote. It is “an alibi instead of an explanation”. Further, they continued, “we feel that the Rand McNally atlas is misleading and a good cause for the people of outlying possessions to be embarrassed and disturbed”. The girls forwarded the correspondence to the Department of the Interior and asked for adjudication. Of course, the seventh-graders were right. As an official clarified, Hawaii was, indeed, part of the US.Yet the government could be just as misleading as Rand McNally on this score. Consider the census: according to the constitution, census takers were required to count only the states, but they had always counted the territories, too. Or, at least, they had counted the continental territories. The overseas territories were handled differently. Their populations were noted, but they were otherwise excluded from demographic calculations. Basic facts about how long people lived, how many children they had, what races they were – these were given for the mainland alone.The maps and census reports that mainlanders saw presented them with a selectively cropped portrait of their country. The result was profound confusion. “Most people in this country, including educated people, know little or nothing about our overseas possessions,” concluded a governmental report written during the second world war. “As a matter of fact, a lot of people do not know that we have overseas possessions. They are convinced that only ‘foreigners’, such as the British, have an ‘empire’. Americans are sometimes amazed to hear that we, too, have an ‘empire’.”The proposition that the US is an empire is less controversial today. The case can be made in a number of ways. The dispossession of Native Americans and relegation of many to reservations was pretty transparently imperialist. Then, in the 1840s, the US fought a war with Mexico and seized a third of it. Fifty years later, it fought a war with Spain and claimed the bulk of Spain’s overseas territories.Empire isn’t just landgrabs, though. What do you call the subordination of African Americans? Starting in the interwar period, the celebrated US intellectual WEB Du Bois argued that black people in the US looked more like colonised subjects than like citizens. Many other black thinkers, including Malcolm X and the leaders of the Black Panthers, have agreed.Or what about the spread of US economic power abroad? The US might not have physically conquered western Europe after the second world war, but that didn’t stop the French from complaining of “coca-colonisation”. Critics there felt swamped by US commerce. Today, with the world’s business denominated in dollars, and McDonald’s in more than 100 countries, you can see they might have had a point.Then there are the military interventions. The years since the second world war have brought the US military to country after country. The big wars are well-known: Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. But there has also been a constant stream of smaller engagements. Since 1945, US armed forces have been deployed abroad for conflicts or potential conflicts 211 times in 67 countries. Call it peacekeeping if you want, or call it imperialism. But clearly this is not a country that has kept its hands to itself.Yet among all the talk of empire, one thing that often slips from view is actual territory. Yes, many would agree that the US is or has been an empire, for all the reasons above. But how much can most people say about the colonies themselves? Not, I would wager, very much.It is not as if the information isn’t out there. Scholars, many working from the sites of empire themselves, have assiduously researched this topic for decades. The problem is that their works have been sidelined – filed, so to speak, on the wrong shelves. They are there, but as long as we have the logo map in our heads, they will seem irrelevant. They will seem like books about foreign countries. The confusion and shoulder-shrugging indifference that mainlanders displayed at the time of Pearl Harbor hasn’t changed much at all.I will confess to having made this conceptual filing error myself. Although I studied US foreign relations as a doctoral student and read countless books about “American empire” – the wars, the coups, the meddling in foreign affairs – nobody ever expected me to know even the most elementary facts about the territories. They just didn’t feel important.It wasn’t until I travelled to Manila, researching something else entirely, that it clicked. To get to the archives, I would travel by “jeepney”, a transit system originally based on repurposed US army jeeps. I boarded in a section of  Manila where the streets are named after US colleges (Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Notre Dame), states and cities (Chicago, Detroit, New York, Brooklyn, Denver), and presidents (Jefferson, Van Buren, Roosevelt, Eisenhower). When I would arrive at my destination, the Ateneo de Manila University, one of the country’s most prestigious schools, I would hear students speaking what sounded to my Pennsylvanian ears to be virtually unaccented English. Empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it is impossible to miss.The Philippines is not a US territory any more it got its independence after the second world war. Other territories, although they were not granted independence, received new statuses. Puerto Rico became a “commonwealth”, which ostensibly replaced a coercive relationship with a consenting one. Hawaii and Alaska, after some delay, became states, overcoming decades of racist determination to keep them out of the union.Yet today, the US continues to hold overseas territory. Besides Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and a handful of minor outlying islands, the US maintains roughly 800 overseas military bases around the world.None of this, however – not the large colonies, small islands, or military bases – has made much of a dent on the mainland mind. One of the truly distinctive features of the US’s empire is how persistently ignored it has been. This is, it is worth emphasising, unique. The British weren’t confused as to whether there was a British empire. They had a holiday, Empire Day, to celebrate it. France didn’t forget that Algeria was French. It is only the US that has suffered from chronic confusion about its own borders.The reason is not hard to guess. The country perceives itself to be a republic, not an empire. It was born in an anti-imperialist revolt and has fought empires ever since, from Hitler’s Thousand-Year Reich and the Japanese empire to the “evil empire” of the Soviet Union. It even fights empires in its dreams. Star Wars, a saga that started with a rebellion against the Galactic Empire, is one of the highest-grossing film franchises of all time.This self-image of the US as a republic is consoling, but it is also costly. Most of the cost has been paid by those living in the colonies and around the military bases. The logo map has relegated them to the shadows, which are a dangerous place to live. At various times, the inhabitants of the US empire have been shot, shelled, starved, interned, dispossessed, tortured and experimented on. What they haven’t been, by and large, is seen.The logo map carries a cost for mainlanders, too. It gives them a truncated view of their own history, one that excludes part of their country. It is an important part. The overseas parts of the US have triggered wars, brought forth inventions, raised up presidents and helped define what it means to be “American”. Only by including them in the picture do we see a full portrait of the country – not as it appears in its fantasies, but as it actually is.How to Hide an Empire: A Short History of the Greater United States by Daniel Immerwahr will be published by Bodley Head on 28 February.

He told diplomats that he “does not expect a solution this week”.“The vote yesterday indicated there is no majority in the Tory party for the withdrawal agreement,” one diplomat said after Barnier’s address. “He said ‘strategy May has failed’ and that she needs to go cross-party.”A number of ambassadors echoed Barnier’s reading. “We have a major problem,” one told the meeting.Barnier, who will meet Corbyn on Thursday, also told diplomats that during a dinner with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, on Monday, the British cabinet minister had pressed the need for a legal guarantee of being able to exit the backstop or a time-limit on the customs union it envisages.The EU official told the ambassadors that it appeared crucial to the government to be able to change the legal advice given by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. Cox is due to go to Brussels with Barclay on Monday.Sources in London suggested the prime minister had hoped that other EU leaders would be more understanding of the kind of parliamentary game-playing seen on Thursday than officials in Brussels. “They are all politicians,” said a government source.Privately, Downing Street is exasperated by what it regards as self-interested posturing by some MPs. Sources described the prime minister as furious in the voting lobbies on Wednesday night.On Friday, May’s spokeswoman said the previous vote in January, where MPs passed an amendment demanding the backstop be replaced with alternative arrangements and rejected the possibility of no deal, was the only one that had spelled out what parliament would accept.“The motion on 29 January remains the only one the Commons has passed expressing what it does want, and that is what we are pursuing,” the spokeswoman said.Anger at the ERG’s antics was explicit from soft Brexit ministers in the aftermath of the defeat. The defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the group’s actions “selfish and provocative” and said they were acting as a “party within a party”.Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister, gave his strongest signal yet he was prepared to resign unless the government allowed him to back efforts to stop no deal by the next vote at the end of February.“If my colleagues cannot accept a necessary compromise, or if government does not itself move to prevent no deal, then I expect parliament to do so, as such moves would certainly pass a commons vote,” he said. “I will continue to act consistently with the views I have regularly set out.”Senior Labour figures, including Keir Starmer and Jon Trickett, are to hold a fresh round of meetings with their government counterparts next week over whether a cross-party consensus can be found.One person present at the last meeting said Barclay and May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, appeared serious about looking for common ground – but that little progress was likely to be made until May is willing to lift her objection to a customs union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/337cc98ed67483d28425c19deb9bf78026fc9b28/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e96aba4a7f2ae746577dea41031d80cd","title":"may has been playing all sides readers on the eu brexit strategy vote","story":"You have been reacting to MPs passing an amendment to replace the Irish backstop and discussing what might be next for BrexitAnother awful day in Brexitland. This country is limping towards a chaotic exit. The strident voices of the far right shouting down any rational discussion. We have a PM who is incompetent and who has become an international embarrassment, an ineffectual leader of the opposition at odds with his membership and half his party and a media largely hell bent on driving us over the cliff. How has our once revered democracy morphed into this mess? DaivedoverEvery time that May makes a concession to the ERG they take a step back to reveal yet another demand and uncover more of the trap that has been there all along. She is like a weak, second-rate school teacher who is letting the louts in the back row of her class dominate and control all lessons. The ERG has a clear agenda of their own and that has nothing to do with what is best for the country or for the majority of people in the country. These are the arrogant and self-serving men who conned and coerced voters into taking back control and now expect that power to be given to them. Theresa May is incapable of spotting a wolf in wolf’s clothing. Why? John HewardYou get what you deserve. May has been trying to play to all sides of the argument. It cannot work. The hard right Tories will only accept a no strings deal. The more centrist Tories want to either remain or have a deal that to a certain extent, ties us to Europe. This is where Tories have existed for decades. Surely May didn’t really think that the two groups would unite over policies that either side could not agree to? She did not think to plan an exit before even triggering article 50. She should have spent a year in trying to find consensus instead of just applying her “my way or the byway” approach. Cameron is to blame for this fiasco, but May is guilty of completely mishandling the whole thing. morbileBrexit is bad enough, but the constitutional disaster that May and co are overseeing is worse. In the space of just over two months, her government has been found in contempt of parliament, and heavily lost votes on key items of government policy. Yet she maintains that nothing has changed, continues on her path unaltered with little or no admonition from the populist press or the public. Given the precedents she is setting - if a really competent leader ever got into power, imagine what havoc could be wreaked - as parliamentary scrutiny has effectively been shown to be, well, ineffective. dougmeyberryBetween the Malthouse fiasco and now the ERG abstaining on this vote (and handing May another authority sapping defeat) the PM needs to stop pretending that Rees-Mogg and his merry men will accept anything except a no-deal exit. The days are long gone where there was any point in pretending that she can somehow come to terms with them, except by a complete surrender to their position. If there are any solutions to this mess, it will be in found spite of the ERG, and pretending it can be part of any solution is delusional. CaligulaMcNuttMay’s premiership has delivered the very worst of all worlds. It has allowed the ERG to undermine her from the sidelines, given disproportionate levels of influence to the DUP, and allowed no-deal advocates like Davis and Raab to fritter away two years’ worth of negotiating time while supposedly acting as Brexit Secretary. On the evidence since 2017, May must now outstrip Cameron as our worst PM ever. Her almost unique combination of total inflexibility, weakness and insecurity leads to her appeasing the ERG and the hard Brexiteers in her own party while failing to realise that the ERG aren’t remotely interested in anything other than “no deal” WestonTigerSurely it’s time that even Theresa May acknowledges that the ERG are not acting in good faith? They’re advocating no deal because they know parliament will finally have too much sense to go down that route, leaving them free to proclaim their ideological purity and completely disassociate themselves from any problems that arise from Brexit. davidabsalomThe Tories have completely failed at every stage of this process, from calling a referendum on the issue in the first place to everything that has ensued as a result. Any PM with even a crumb of authority would have disciplined or expelled members of herhis party who vote against the interests of the nation. May clearly has no authority and, it is becoming clear, no respect for the good of the nation. Brexit must be paused of stopped altogether so we can bring in a government worthy of the name.

Some party colleagues say that if she were to go it could represent a tipping point.Conservative MPs considering their futures, according to those involved in the talks, include Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, and Heidi Allen, who represents South Cambridgeshire.The three have cooperated closely with Labour MPs as part of the People’s Vote second referendum campaign, and were all lead signatories of an amendment on Thursday that forced the government to agree to release no-deal cabinet documents.Those involved in the discussions believe that a crunch point could come at the end of February, when pro-EU Labour MPs desperately want Corbyn to back a second referendum and restless Conservatives want May to rule out no deal if she cannot get a revised Brexit agreement through parliament.A source in the People’s Vote campaign said: “Whatever happens, it is important to emphasise this is nothing to do with our campaign which is strictly and proudly non-partisan, involving supporters from all parties and none.”Another idea circulating is that the new group could be called the Reformist party, with the Lib Dems contributing national and local resources. “There are a lot of generals here without an army – well the Lib Dems have an army of members,” one MP involved said.A Labour MP contacted by members of the group said he believed there were around a dozen MPs in his party close to quitting. Those involved in the organisation are understood to have conducted significant polling, including in target constituencies.“I honestly believe this is imminent. You will see the values emphasised first, rather than policies to help people make that change. There are the names that are public but others are involved, including in the organisation of it, who have never been named,” the MP said.Labour strategists say they are relaxed about a potential breakaway, arguing that the figures involved are unlikely to be of the political standing of the four former cabinet members who helped found the Social Democratic party in 1981.They also believe there is a firm majority in the shadow cabinet against a “people’s vote” and continue to hope May will ultimately be forced to soften her red lines and shift towards something more like the form of Brexit they have proposed.The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, issued a stark warning to MPs considering leaving the party that their project would be rejected by voters. “Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna and Gavin Shuker are marginal figures with marginal politics,” he said.“This is very different to the SDP breakaway in 1981. I was there, and I remember at least a certain level of public support for their policies. The situation is completely different now. Socialism has gone mainstream, a Blairite programme has no support amongst the public and parties pursuing similar programmes across Europe have seen their vote share plummet.”Some in Labour appear to be goading the grouping to split. On Thursday, Momentum released a spoof Valentine’s Day video aimed at Umunna, set to the song Please Don’t Go. It urged him to stay in the party, but concluded: “If you go we’re keeping the house xxx.”Local Lib Dem parties in some constituencies, such as Wavertree and Totnes where it has a presence, have been told to be receptive if any MP were to quit Labour or the Conservatives, even if they do so to sit in Westminster as an independent.Party insiders say the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, could step down after the local elections in May, creating a vacancy for a leader of any new movement. They, too, have been studying the history of the SDP and say the Lib Dems could be open to anything from a full merger to an alliance or supporting independent candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc63bda77b80e35254c36eb0ae5895ebb94e5c5/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7ee389afeac38b88cce66f85a58a63","title":"how brexit revealed four new political factions","story":"Analysis of Commons voting patterns show how Europhobe and Europhile rebels from both main parties are forming new parliamentary blocsOur study clusters MPs by the similarity of their voting patterns: if two MPs always vote the same way, the chart groups them tightly together.The patterns on key Brexit votes reveal the emergence of four cross-party political factions that are wrangling for control of the negotiations.A cross-party group of pro-European MPs usually votes with each other, with or against their own frontbenches, while Europhobe Conservatives now constitute a party within the party.Search for your MP to see which faction they were most closely aligned with as the Brexit votes unfoldedHere each MP is represented by a circle () and grouped by party, but key Brexit votes have upended traditional party politics and seen the formation of new cross-party alliances.With the government\u0027s first defeat on Brexit, parliament\u0027s decision to demand a vote for itself on the final deal, we see the initial fracturing of the two-party system. The rebels on each side are few, but they would prove persistent.The cracks widened as the government comfortably, with Labour help, defeated a motion to commit Britain to EEA membership. But those voting for the motion were forming the core of a new soft Brexit alliance, across party lines. Each MP is linked () to those with the most similar voting pattern to theirs on Brexit.Perhaps sensing what was unfolding, a week later Theresa May offered concessions to stop Dominic Grieve and others from winning a vote to stop a no-deal Brexit. In December, the Commons found the government in contempt of parliament for failing to release legal advice. The remainersoft Brexit alliance was strengthened, and joined for this vote by the Democratic Unionist party and hard Brexit wing of the Tory party.After that a series of defeats for the government hardened up the isions. First, a vote to block government financing in the event of no deal ...... then another, to force a quick response from a government that was quickly losing the confidence of many parliamentarians ...... and finally, the long-expected defeat of the withdrawal deal itself. As well as throwing the business of government into disarray, this vote cemented the existence of a separate, fourth bloc, as the pro-leave European Research Group (ERG) and friends definitively peeled off from the main Tory voting record. Yvette Cooper\u0027s amendment to extend article 50 in the event of no deal was rejected after 14 Labour rebels defied the party whips and voted with the government, causing them to splinter off from the main Labour bloc ...... and then Graham Brady\u0027s amendment to reopen negotiations on the Irish backstop passed with the help of seven Labour MPs. The Labour leavers and the Tory remainers now occupy a sort of parliamentary no-man\u0027s land.May\u0027s latest defeat splits the Tory Europhobes into two subgroups: the hardcore, mostly ERG members, and a second tier who stayed loyal last night. But the overall picture remains. British politics is now dominated by four roughly equal factions, none of them with the heft to impose its viewpoint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f5db71b0560a35b5e4ddbd8e51c9c7b8db78f2/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=165d28f02edc88ae07362b11873b917a","title":"jokers please first human mars mission may need onboard comedians","story":"Researchers are working with Nasa to see if clowns help team cohesion on long space missionsWanted: smart, fit and unflappable applicants for humanity’s first mission to Mars. Must have: crazy wig, oversized boots and a big red nose.It is enough to make Neil Armstrong spin in his grave, but researchers have found that the success of a future mission to the red planet may depend on the ship having a class clown.Rather than the cool personality that underpinned the Right Stuff in the Apollo era, future astronauts may need to prove they have something very different: the Silly Stuff. An onboard comedian is a proven way to unite teams in stressful situations, research shows.“These are people that have the ability to pull everyone together, bridge gaps when tensions appear and really boost morale,” said Jeffrey Johnson, an anthropologist at the University of Florida. “When you’re living with others in a confined space for a long period of time, such as on a mission to Mars, tensions are likely to fray. It’s vital you have somebody who can help everyone get along, so they can do their jobs and get there and back safely. It’s mission critical.”Johnson spent four years studying overwintering crews in Antarctica and identified the importance of clowns, leaders, buddies, storytellers, peacemakers and counsellors for bonding teams together and making them work smoothly. He found the same mixes worked in US, Russian, Polish, Chinese and Indian bases.“These roles are informal, they emerge within the group. But the interesting thing is that if you have the right combination the group does very well. And if you don’t, the group does very badly,” he said.Nasa plans to fly astronauts around the moon in 2023 as part of its preparation for a crewed mission to Mars as early as 2033. The Russian and Chinese space agencies have proposed human missions from 2040 onwards. Private ventures such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX have also set their sights on the planet.But a mission to Mars is no cakewalk. On average, the red planet is 140m miles from Earth and the travel time one way is around eight months. The distance alone is expected to take a psychological toll, but astronauts must also face a time delay in communications of up to 20 minutes each way. In an emergency, there will be no time to call mission control: the crew are effectively on their own.Even minor delays in communication are bad for crews. When Nasa tested a 50 second communications delay on astronauts on the international space station, they found well-being slumped and frustration rose, with knock-on effects for how efficiently tasks got done.Johnson is now working with Nasa to explore whether clowns and other characters are crucial for the success of long space missions. So far he has monitored four groups of astronauts who spent 30 to 60 days in the agency’s mock space habitat, the Human Exploration Research Analog, or Hera, in Houston, Texas.“We now want to see if these types of informal role dynamics function similarly in space-simulated environments,” Johnson said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Washington DC. Early results suggest they do, he said.Johnson, who also studied isolated salmon fishers in Alaska, found that clowns were often willing to be the butt of jokes and pranks. In Antarctica, one clown he observed endured a mock funeral and burial in the tundra, but was crucial for building bridges between clusters of overwintering scientists and between contractors and researchers, or “beakers” as the contractors called them.The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen appreciated the importance of the expedition clown, Johnson said. In 1910, Amundsen picked the large, jolly chef Adolf Lindstrøm for his attempt on the South Pole, knowing that Lindstrøm’s joie de vivre would relieve the stress of homesickness and the long polar nights. “He has rendered greater and more valuable services to the Norwegian polar expedition than any other man,” Amundsen noted in his diary.Johnson said: “Lindstrøm was viewed by others as a great entertainer who helped maintain spirits and morale over the long austral winter. His role was informal but critical for maintaining group cohesion in this extreme environment. “Scott’s polar expedition was radically different. The crew broke into cliques, they didn’t have a cohesive group.”But, as Lindstrøm showed, there is more to it than making people laugh. “Being funny won’t be enough to land somebody the job,” Johnson added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8eaf158f7274a1ecb0bd7b4c9fe581ce87601ea/243_5_5229_3137/master/5229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3410918b6d324fbe967341f92708d9ce","title":"laura muir targets kirsty wade indoor mile record birmingham","story":"• Kirsty Wade’s indoor mile Birtish record has stood for 31 years• Muir to defend her 1500m and 3,000m indoor titles next monthShortly after Laura Muir first broke into the British team in 2014 she received an unexpected request from the Scottish middle distance legend Kirsty Wade. “We think Laura has something special,” she wrote in a long email via her husband. “And we would love to see her name in front of mine in the rankings over the next few years.”Five years on, Muir, who still has the email, intends to oblige by beating Wade’s British indoor mile record of 4:23.86 – which has stood for 31 years – at Saturday’s Birmingham grand prix.“All going to plan, a record should hopefully be on the cards,” said Muir, who already holds numerous national records between 1,000m and 5,000m. “It’s the one in the middle that I am missing out of the ones I have indoors, so it would be very nice to add another one.”The race will be Muir’s final prep run before next month’s European Indoor Championships in Glasgow, where she will defend both her 1500m and 3,000m titles, and she says that her form could not be better.“At the British champs last week my coach Andy Young wanted me to sub-60 secs for the last 400m and I ran 56,” she said. “I was like ‘wow, OK, that ticks that box’.“My sessions I have been happy with, the endurance ones and sprinting ones. I have been running PB sessions at both ends. I am very happy where I am at.”Muir also explained why she had changed her mind and will go for two gold medals in Glasgow, having originally intended to run one event. “I am running really well, there are no injury concerns, so I thought ‘why not go for it?’” she said.“If it had been somewhere else, I don’t know if we would have done it, it is quite a big ask.

For Mark Wood, whose scorching return to England’s Test team sent everyone a bit gaga in St Lucia, the answer is wonderfully simple: “You almost feel like a superhero. I’ve been playing Mario Kart recently and yeah, it’s like when you get a magic mushroom and you’re just absolutely flying.”It will come as little surprise to learn Wood is still glowing from victory in the third Test against West Indies and his maiden five-wicket haul. The 29-year-old sat down for a chat this week and, in that inimitable Ashington twang, his delight at finally becoming a match-winner shone through.“I’ll never forget the feeling of that spell,” he said. “If I’m ever down about my bowling I’ll rewatch the highlights. I’ve watched them about 20 times already – probably more. This will sound bad but seeing it back I just thought: ‘Wow, that’s me.’ I couldn’t believe how well I bowled and how fast it looked on TV. I was so happy.”Wood’s recall in St Lucia may have come too late for the series, with a resurgent West Indies side, led by Jason Holder, having already taken a 2-0 lead. But first-innings figures of five for 41 that propelled Joe Root’s side to a 232-run consolation win were more than just the numbers in the scorebook.In his initial 19-ball burst before tea on the second day, one that dispatched Shai Hope, Roston Chase and Shimron Hetmyer, Wood ensured the clouded Test leg of this tour would end with a significant silver lining his slippery pace, something many feared had been sliced away by three bouts of ankle surgery, was back.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsHis first delivery was clocked at 88mph and the follow-up at 90. When Hetmyer survived his hat-trick ball, the speedgun hit 94.6mph. The crowd was transfixed, a usually busy England dressing room stopped in its tracks and the slips appeared closer to the sightscreen than the stumps. The sense from Wood was that the batsmen wished they were too.“You could see their batsmen coming in and looking more nervous,” he said. “Hetmyer had attacked our bowlers from the outset in the first two Tests. I expected more of the same and when he didn’t I thought: ‘I’ve got him here. I’m on top of him.’ As soon as you feel like that it’s like: ‘Right, any ball I can get a wicket.’ I was so in the zone too, I didn’t know my field. I was just so focused on the batsman.”Wood winces when reminded about his cheeky comment to TalkSport that Hetmyer had “two feet in the toilet” before edging a 91mph lifter through to first slip (a catch that left Root’s hands burning) as he admires the Guyanese left-hander. Nevertheless, after two tough Tests for England’s batsmen, he loved switching the panic over to the opposition, as he had done in Australia last winter.“I’d been with the Test squad towards the end of the Ashes and the lads had got peppered. So when the ODIs came, I told them: ‘Right, I’m going to hit David Warner in the head first ball’ and I was pretty much on the money. A few came over after I got him out a couple of balls later and said the mood had changed. I wanted to have that same impact here.After completing his five-wicket haul, spearing a yorker into Gabriel’s stumps at the start of his second spell, Wood wheeled away in delight, before snaffling the match ball, kissing it for the crowd and yomping back to a delighted England dressing room.“I held the ball up and felt so proud, then I got into the pavilion, had hug with the physio Craig de Weymarn – he’s touched me in places my wife never has! – and it all sunk in. It was everything I’d wanted after all I’d been through with injury. I know it’s only one five-fer and there’s Jimmy and Broady with tons of them, but it was so special. I felt I finally belonged in the England Test team. I put the ball in my England cap, sat them next to me and just looked at them. All the emotions came out. I was a bit teary.”Wood wants to be known for more than just pace and noted the left-handers removed – Hetmyer and Darren Bravo – were done by away movement off the deck, something he and Chris Silverwood had worked on. England’s bowling coach, and Loughborough’s Kevin Shine, are also behind the new lengthened run-up that puts less stress on his body.Wood gushed about the support of the entire England team and staff, not least the psychologist, David Young, who has worked on his self-esteem and taught him to focus on the process of bowling, not the outcome. Sarah, whom he married in December, has been his rock off the field, while the good folk at Durham deserve England’s gratitude as ever.All this support was needed. Having played only 12 Tests since his debut four years ago, Wood struggled and after his third ankle operation in late 2016, briefly lost his love for cricket. The key was last winter when he learned to push through bowling with niggles to gain physical confidence. A strong Lions tour to the UAE last November, when Olly Stone went down injured at the start of the tour, led to his recall. It followed a sit down with Trevor Bayliss in Sri Lanka before Christmas, where he had played only one ODI.This instant impact prompted two questions: Could he have played in Antigua? And can all this be bottled up for the World Cup and Ashes campaigns this summer? He feels the former was possible but also backed Sam Curran’s retention on merit. Equally, as regards facing Australia, he is not looking too far ahead. If conditions suit others more, he won’t mind. “Honestly, I just want the team to win,” he says.Making England’s World Cup squad is certainly a goal, with the five one-dayers against West Indies that start on Wednesday a final chance to impress before the provisional group are selected. Wood knows competition is high and, as regards the first XI, he feels he is battling Tom Curran and David Willey for one spot given Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes and Liam Plunkett appear shoo-ins.“Add one more with Jofra Archer too,” says Wood, in reference to the Barbados-born quick who is soon to qualify for England duty. “But the competition pushes everyone. I’m desperate to play in a World Cup in England.

From the Nigel Twiston-Davies yard that had a winner with its first runner back after racing restarted this week, he is unbeaten over hurdles and looked highly progressive when scoring at Cheltenham in December.That was his handicap debut and even a 12lb hike in the ratings may not stop him. Getaway Trump is a talented opponent but may find this too much of a test of speed.1.35 Ascot A late faller left Top Ville Ben to score by 46 lengths at Wetherby over Christmas, a margin that rather flatters him. Still, he had matters well in hand before that incident and could have a few pounds to spare over the rest in this Reynoldstown Novices’ Chase.1.45 Wincanton This looks a good chance for Gino Trail, who put up a fine effort behind Dolos a fortnight ago, in his first outing for 10 months. Kerry Lee’s veteran, who had a wind operation in the off-season, will provide these rivals with a serious test from the front.1.55 Haydock With Alan King firing in winners for fun just now, it may be worth taking a chance on the fitness of Yanworth, who has not been seen since the last festival, when he was sixth in the stayers. He would be comfortably the best of these if on song.2.10 Ascot The winner of this race last year, Regal Encore has a fine record around Ascot and is only a couple of pounds higher this time. His one run this season was not especially convincing but Anthony Honeyball’s string was under a cloud at the time and is faring better now. This has been the plan for some time.2.45 Ascot Moving the Denman Chase from Newbury has cost us the chance to see Native River, who seems ill-suited to right-handed tracks. As a result, this looks a straightforward opportunity for the King George winner, Clan Des Obeaux, and it will be a surprise if Terrefort can give him a fright.3.00 Wincanton A close third to Yanworth in this race two years ago, Sceau Royal is of interest as he reverts to the smaller obstacles. His Shloer Chase success in November suggests he retains plenty of pace.3.35 Haydock The Welsh National was too much for Ballyoptic, who carried top weight on a testing surface, but the drier ground and flatter track here can show this stout stayer to better advantage. It should help that the fences will not be as stiff as they were in November.3.55 Ascot Ruth Jefferson was hoping to walk the course early on Saturday morning in the hope it has sufficient give for Waiting Patiently.

Clearly her company thought so too. While they continued to perform her works around the world, it was nine years before they commissioned anyone to make a new full-length work.And here it is, by Greek choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou – a huge Bausch fan since he saw her Café Müller aged 19, and a great fit for the company. Since She opens with a tribute of sorts: a procession of dancers walking on chairs, just like the ones used in Café Müller. There is something slightly uncanny about the way the piece is so recognisably the work of Tanztheater Wuppertal, and of Papaioannou too. Both have a line in dreamlike weirdness, incidents and interactions taken out of their contexts to create an absurdist “other” world, but one that cuts close to the bone.Papaioannou, who trained in fine art, is interested in manipulating materials as well as bodies. The set is a tall pile of foam mats, looking like a slate mountain, for the often semi-naked dancers to slither down. We see long tubes threaded through a man’s trousers forcing him to scuttle like a multi-legged beast, and a woman’s dress pierced with arrows.There are arresting moments, including a wonderful scene in which Ophelia Young is carried atop a table that’s being spun in circles while she magically stays in one place, still but for the wind through her hair, radiant and regal like the figurehead of a ship.Papaioannou’s imagination and love of illusion can be fanciful, almost vaudevillian, but here there is a nagging sense of the degrading or unseemly beneath. (I won’t even tell you what Azusa Seyama bakes into a pie.) We see transformation and repetition, flirtation and manipulation, and people making simple tasks, or the route from A to B, way more difficult than they need to be – all very Bauschian metaphors for life. There are so many clever moments, but the heart and humour wane, leaving a desolate stage. Perhaps Papaioannou’s approach is too reverent. Or this time the alchemy just didn’t quite take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f719f5d16301859ac2b5df339b92eacff9082e9c/0_154_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68c7cd8ffd27b1324bedd78b2bc5f35e","title":"amazon new york long island city hq2 michael gianaris","story":"Michael Gianaris turned his outrage into leverage when he was appointed to an obscure state board – and soon after, the company called the project offAmazon made plenty of enemies with its plans for a new headquarters in New York, but one of those foes played an outsized role in sending the tech giant packing.The man who stared down Amazon is state senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood where the company set its sights.Gianaris came out in opposition to a deal that proposed $3bn in subsidies and tax breaks for the new campus, alongside a slew of other politicians. But his outrage turned into leverage when he was last week appointed to an obscure state board where he would be one of three people with veto power over the project. Days later, reports emerged that Amazon was rethinking its plans.By Thursday, the company had called the project off.“New York is in a unique position to stand up and draw a line, because Amazon is not bigger than New York,” Gianaris told the . “We have the ability to set the tone for the nation.”If Amazon had had its way, its new campus would have risen on a waterfront parcel across the East River opposite Manhattan. It was to employ at least 25,000 people and, backers said, generate $27bn in tax money for the city and state over the next 25 years.Grassroots groups organized quickly against the project, which they worried would drive up rents. Amazon executives further angered opponents when they vowed to oppose any effort by workers to unionize.“A community that was facing its own demolition was salvaged. And New York took a stand against the type of corporate subsidies that are increasing the wealth concentration in this country,” Gianaris said.New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the project’s chief proponent, has made clear who he will blame for the project’s collapse: his fellow Democrats in the state senate.“The New York state senate has done tremendous damage,” he said on Thursday. “They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity.”The state senate’s top Republican also took aim. “From the start, the senate Democrats have politicized and poisoned this process just so they could avoid the wrath of the extreme left wing of their party,” minority leader John Flanagan said after the deal’s collapse.But Gianaris had no problem playing the chief naysayer. “I’m very comfortable being the person that says we should not be giving $3bn to Jeff Bezos when we can’t afford to fix our subways or have enough housing for people to live in,” he said.The politician fought the project on multiple fronts, holding rallies, gathering petition signatures and introducing bills that would bar New York from participating in nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) like the one used to lure Amazon, and prohibit real estate sales based on inside information.But his best chance to stop the project came through a little-known panel called the public authorities control board, which had to sign off on a development plan.Gianaris, who became a deputy majority leader in the senate when Democrats claimed control of the body this year after years of Republican dominance, was chosen as the senate’s representative on the board, a post that comes with veto power. That was a hurdle for Amazon, which had counted on the state’s maneuver to avoid a city council vote.Amazon picked New York and Arlington, Virginia, for new offices after staging a national competition between cities vying to host its secondary headquarters, after its base in Seattle.News that the company was wavering on New York set off a new scramble among cities which had lost out but were quick to say they would still welcome the project.Dallas was eager for another shot, with an editorial in the Dallas Morning News headlined: “Dear Amazon, New York Doesn’t Want You Dallas Does.” Miami and Chicago renewed their interest, as did Newark, New Jersey, which had offered Amazon $7bn in incentives. Even a Staten Island city councilman made a pitch for the company to simply switch New York city boroughs and avoid the strife.But Amazon disappointed the other contenders, saying it has no plans to reopen the HQ2 search.It’s not unusual for big development projects to generate big opposition in New York. A few are killed, but more commonly local officials extract concessions from the developer.For a company like Amazon, that may have meant giving up some of its subsidies or agreeing to remain neutral if employees attempted to unionize.But Amazon, which dangled its headquarters as a prize for cities to covet, proved unwilling to deal.“Rather than engage with the community that would be most affected by their project, they instead decide to pack up and leave like a petulant child,” Gianaris said. “There’s no indication they took seriously the community’s concerns regarding this project.”Gianaris, meanwhile, isn’t about to start shopping at Amazon again.“I was lamenting during the holidays that it was really hard to shop without using Amazon. That’s how pervasive it’s become,” he said. “They’re into everything, and that’s part of the danger of who they are and the kind of power they have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22cdc227279fb83d1ef12fec2f4bb282e4f6297/0_0_1204_898/master/1204.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1afa981f1c25d4a852960d4e74f0e29 1010w","title":"german minister calls ban gay conversion therapy","story":"‘Homosexuality is not an illness,’ says health minister Jens SpahnThe German health minister, Jens Spahn, has said that he will seek to ban “conversion therapies” that claim to change sexual orientation. “Homosexuality is not an illness, which is why it does not need to be treated,” Spahn, who is gay himself, told the left-leaning Berlin daily Die Tageszeitung.He hoped that a German law banning such therapies could be adopted by the summer.Conversion therapy – sometimes referred to as “cure” therapy, reparative therapy, ex-gay therapy or sexual-orientation change efforts – refers to any treatment aiming to change a person’s sexual orientation or suppress their gender identity. They have spread across the United States and have been used by parents of homosexual or transgender adolescents against their will.Most such practices depend on talking therapy, but some techniques involve injections of large doses of testosterone, electric shocks, and other treatments.“I do not believe in these therapies, mainly owing to my own homosexuality,” said Spahn, who represents the right wing of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party.The health minister is counting on support from his colleagues if and when a vote is taken. “I cannot imagine there is a partisan of conversion therapies in my parliamentary group,” he said.Within the EU, only Malta and some Spanish regions have banned the practice outright.

There was a lull in its activity after the 11 September 2001 attacks when the Pakistani government cracked down on the group.But it has re-emerged in recent years, carrying out attacks in India including on a Punjab state airbase in January 2016, and nine months later, on an army base in Uri near the ceasefire line with Pakistan.The Uri attack killed 19 and prompted the Indian government to announce it had carried out “surgical strikes” to destroy militant camps inside Pakistan-controlled Kashmir – a measured response that salved public anger without igniting a wider conflict.Control of the Himalayan region, one of the most militarised places on earth, is ided between India and Pakistan and claimed in full by both. China administers a smaller patch in the east.A full-blown revolt against Indian control of Kashmir bolstered by Pakistani and Afghani fighters raged throughout the 1990s but waned after negotiations between Delhi and Islamabad.It has been replaced by a low-level insurgency waged largely by young Kashmiris disillusioned with India’s failure to accommodate popular calls for greater autonomy or independence for the region.Thursday’s attacker was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar, 20, a mason who joined the militancy in March last year. In a video released after the attack, Dar said he was avenging human rights violations and warned that more killing would follow.Both the ruling Bharatiya Janata party and the main opposition Congress cancelled all political events on Friday.

Elsewhere, 15 people were crushed to death at a ruling party rally in eastern Port Harcourt. On Thursday, 14 sacks of ballot papers were intercepted in Kano state – though police said they were merely “specimen” papers to educate voters.As Nigerians prepared to cast their votes, data analysts raised concerns about the number of new voters registered since January 2018, which they said increased by almost exactly the same percentage in each of the country’s states, and suggested that the results of Saturday’s presidential election could be open to mass rigging.Plotted on a scatter line graph, there was a 0.99 correlation across all the states, without a single outlier. According to three separate data analysts, the parity cannot be a coincidence, and two of them called it a “statistical impossibility”. “Only God works that closely,” one said.But other observers said there were other possible explanations for the correlation, including demographics.“In itself, it’s not an indicator of any kind of electoral malpractice or manipulation,” said economist Nonso Obikili. He said the correlation in the registration figures across states was “what you would expect, because demographic changes don’t happen very quickly”.If some of the new voters registered are fake, it could imply meddling at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) , though it is unclear whether it would be the ruling party or the opposition that would stand to benefit.Additional data seen by the  shows irregularities in registration for the 2015 election in which Buhari came to power, until now considered to have been free and fair.On Sunday 16 February, 84m voters will choose who leads Africa’s largest democracy. Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.Buhari\u0027s 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.Main opposition People\u0027s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\u0026nbsp He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.Atiku\u0027s opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.Nigeria is deeply ided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.It isn\u0027t just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria’s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a Not Too Young to Run campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u0027s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off.An analysis of separate figures shows that manipulation may have happened in favour of Buhari’s party, which was running in opposition to Goodluck Jonathan’s People’s Democratic party. A clue may have been dropped last July when the INEC, perhaps inadvertently, publicly referenced a different set of results from the one on which Buhari’s victory was based.Both documents showed 29.4 million votes were cast. But according to the original results, 31.7 million accredited voters participated in the election, whereas in the second set of results, that figure dropped to 23.6 million.The discrepancy suggests an additional 6 million accredited voters, far more than the APC’s winning margin – as per the original result set – of 2.6 million votes.Smartcard readers were used for the first time in 2015 and the second set of results was released in response to widespread criticism after the new technology malfunctioned, forcing millions of voters, including Jonathan, to use the manual process. The second set of results appears to have disappeared from the INEC’s website two months ago, along with all others relating to the 2015 poll.Nigerian elections have a long history of rigging, and it is not usually limited to whichever side happens to be in power at the time. Powerful politicians move fluidly between the two main parties, taking support and manipulation mechanisms with them.If free and fair, the election is expected to be very close, with many Nigerians either proclaiming themselves to be “Atikulated” and fed up with the state of the economy or chanting “Sai Buhari”, a term of respect used by those vigorously defending the president’s record.In the ancient northern city of Kano, a Buhari stronghold, men in embroidered kaftan robes and colourful caps said they were voting for Buhari, while opposition billboards had been torn down in the streets. Innocent Okpanachi, an architect in Abuja, said: “The entire system is bad. You vote for who will unite the country.”• This article was amended on 15 February to reflect doubts over the way in which analysts who spoke to the  had interpreted new voter registration data for the 2019 election"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

There’s an unseen network to forests in which trees send signals to each other and form part of a ‘wood wide web’Despite appearances, trees are social beings. For a start, they talk to each other. They’re also sensing, co-operating and collaborating, even across species boundaries. Peter Wohlleben, the German forester-turned-tree-whisperer and author of The Hidden Life of Trees, also says they are suckling their young, that juveniles are learning, and that some elders are sacrificing themselves for the sake of the next generation.While Wohlleben’s view is a step too far towards anthropomorphism for some scientists, the traditional view of trees as isolated, non-sensory beings has been shifting for some time. For example, the phenomenon known as “crown shyness”, in which similarly-sized trees of the same species appear to be respecting each other’s space was recognised almost a century ago. Sometimes, instead of interlacing and jostling for light, the branches of immediate neighbours stop short of one another, leaving a polite gap. There’s still no consensus on how this is managed – abrasion of growing branch tips is one possibility, another is that growth is inhibited when leaves sense infrared light scattered by other leaves close by.Much of the current research on this so called “wood wide web” stems from the work of the Canadian biologist Suzanne Simard. Simard describes the largest inidual trees in a forest as hubs or “mother trees”. Mothers have the deepest, most extensive roots, and are able to supplement smaller trees with water and nutrients, allowing saplings to thrive even in heavy shade. Further experiments suggest that iniduals are able to recognise close relatives and favour them when it comes to transferring the good stuff. Thus healthy iniduals can support damaged neighbours, even leafless stumps, keeping them alive for years, decades, even centuries. This connectivity and collaboration makes much more sense when you realise that the dependent trees may not be random strangers, but old friends, or more persuasive still, close relatives.The discernment shown by trees extends to their enemies as well as allies. Scientists have known for more than 40 years that if a tree is attacked by a leaf-eating animal, it releases ethylene gas. On detecting the ethylene, nearby trees prepare to repel boarders – boosting production of chemicals that make their leaves unpalatable, even toxic. The strategy was first discovered in a study of acacias, and it seems giraffes understood it long before humans: having finished browsing one tree, they habitually move more than 50 metres in an upwind direction before starting on another that is less likely to have sensed the emergency.More recently, however, it’s become clear that not all enemies trigger the same response. When elm and pine trees (and probably others) are first attacked by caterpillars, they respond within seconds to distinctive chemicals in caterpillar saliva, releasing an additional scent that attracts specific varieties of parasitic wasp. The wasps lay eggs in or on the bodies of the caterpillars, and then the emerging wasp grubs devour their host from the inside. If the damage to leaves and branches is caused by something for which the tree has no means of counterattack – such as the wind or cutting with an axe – the chemical response is focused on healing rather than defence.A sobering aspect of recent revelations is that many of these newly recognised “behaviours” are limited to natural growth. In plantations, there are no mother trees, and there is very little connectivity. This is partly because of the way young trees are transplanted and partly because when they are thinned to prevent competition, what little underground connectivity neighbours have established is severed. Seen in this light, modern forestry practices begin to seem almost monstrous: plantations are not communities but crowds of mute, factory-farmed iniduals, felled before they have ever really lived. None of the scientists involved are seriously suggesting trees have feelings, or that the newly discovered sociability of trees is driven by anything other than natural selection. The transactions being observed may be utilitarian rather than altruistic, they might be accidental. Nevertheless, the result is that in supporting each other, trees build sheltered, humid microcosms in which they and their future offspring will stand the best chance of surviving and reproducing. We know these places as forests. The trees, if they “know” anything, know them as home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3794287.1550231528!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"too many people in ireland going to college and unsuited to it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmployers rate further-education graduates slightly higher than college graduates in areas such as team working, commercial awareness and entrepreneurial skills.

Photograph: Niklas Halle’nAFPGetty ImagesTheresa May could have presented MPs on Thursday with a neutral motion that simply took note of her statement on the Brexit negotiations earlier this week. Instead the UK prime minister asked them to reiterate their support for “the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on January 29th”.It must have seemed like a clever idea at the time, but if there is one thing the conspiracy theorists in the Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) are good at, it’s spotting conspiracies. They understood that the motion could be interpreted not only as a reaffirmation of their demand for changes to the Northern Ireland backstop but also as a rejection of a no-deal Brexit in line with another amendment passed on January 29th.The DUP voted with the government, a smart move that tells the government that its 10 votes are available for a Brexit deal as long as the prime minister keeps her promise to secure changes to the backstop. It has the additional merit of warning the government that if the DUP is not satisfied with a renegotiated deal, it will vote against it rather than abstaining.Some leading figures in the ERG were reluctant to be seen to be responsible for the government’s defeat but their decision to abstain rather than vote against the motion did nothing to blunt their action. The Brexiteers have weakened May’s negotiating hand in Europe and diminished her chances of winning the concessions on the backstop that they are demanding.Freak phenomenonFor the EU, Thursday’s vote is confirmation that last month’s majority for the Brady amendment was a freak phenomenon and that the will of the House of Commons remains unsettled. EU negotiators have no incentive to offer any concessions to the UK ahead of a vote on February 27th, when MPs will be able to back an amendment that would force the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.As Conservative former minister Oliver Letwin told the House on Thursday, such an extension would offer MPs an opportunity to seek a consensus approach to Brexit. Such a consensus would almost certainly embrace a permanent customs union and possibly single-market membership.Such a deal would be in the EU’s economic interest and would ease the difficulties Brexit creates for the Border, and Thursday’s vote will persuade EU leaders that it remains a possibility. While such hope is alive, why pass any concession on the backstop across the table to May, knowing that she will toss it into the furnace of the Conservative backbenches?Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

scott lost race south pole didnt have class clown team","story":"NASA scientists have come up with a previously overlooked explanation why the British expedition was beaten by Rauld Amundsen’s Norwegian teamThe reasons for Captain Scott’s heroic failure to become the first to conquer the South Pole have excited fevered debate for more than a century.Was the British expedition beaten by Rauld Amundsen’s Norwegian team by just over a month because of unfavourable weather did they mismanage their supplies was it the failure of the relief dogs to turn up that ultimately sealed Scott’s icy fate on the long return march?All these undoubtedly played a role, but now NASA scientists have come up with a previously overlooked explanation: unlike the Norwegians, Scott didn’t have a joker in his team.Scientists researching the ideal group dynamic for a manned mission to Mars have identified the crucial role of a “class clown” for relieving tension and providing a focal point in high-pressure situations.The insight was inspired by the records of Amundsen’s successful bid for the Pole, and in particular the praise heaped on the expedition’s jovial cook, Adolf Lindstrom.Captain Scott’s heroic failure was because he did not have a joker on his team, scientists have saidProfessor Jeff Johnson, from the university of Florida, said: “He was viewed by others as a great entertainer who helped maintain spirits and moral over the long austral winter.“Amundsen wrote in his diary that “he has rendered greater and more valuable services to the Norwegian polar expedition than any other man”.“A Mars mission will need a Lindstrom-like figure, somebody who can break the tension, can bring people together.“This is something that NASA is taking seriously and looking to incorporate into their strategy,” he added.A large man who rarely left ship other than to indulge in his beloved pastime of ptarmigan hunting, Lindstrom was nevertheless a stalwart of Amundsen’s many expeditions, credited with helping his crewmates through their “polar nerves” with his tireless humour.The Norwegian team arrived at the geographical south pole on 14th December 1911 and, unlike the pursuing British team, who arrived on 17th January 1912, made it safely back to their ship.Professor Johnson helped pioneer the science of group dynamics from observing teams operating in the South Pole over more than four years, as well as researching the pioneering arctic expeditions.He is now contributing to a NASA project to incorporate his “class clown” insights into selection of a manned mission to reach the red planet at some point in the next 25 years.Astronauts on such a mission are likely to be away from Earth for at least three years.“These roles are informal, they emerge within the group, but the interesting thing is that if you have the right combination the group does very well” he said.“And if you don’t, the group does very badly.”The class clown theory is now being tested in a series of experiments whereby at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where four-man teams are isolated for periods ranging from 30 to 120 days in a mock space environment.A parallel NASA project is also analysing transcripts of conversations aboard the International Space Station to gain better insights into ideal team dynamics.The agency has said it plans to send the first manned mission to Mars within the next 25 years.Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder, has said it will be possible to create a city on the planet with a million inhabitants within the next 50 years.However, a number of studies have predicted that with current technology the physical demands of a manned trip to Mars would be prohibitive.Professor Johnson said NASA’s next talk would be to come up with a set of tests capable of identifying the potential for applicant astronauts to use humour in high-stress situations.Professor Johnson added: “It’s pretty universal. It doesn’t matter whether you are Russian, Polish, Chinese, Indian. Group dynamics happen in very similar ways across all human groups.NASA is also looking at wearable sensors that keep track of social interactions and provide instant feedback when conflict happens.The research is being discussed at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Washington DC.Please review our commenting policyFive dead as gunman opens fire with \u0026#39laser-sighted pistol\u0026#39 at Illinois factoryThousands of criminals GPS tagged in nationwide 247 surveillance scheme to free up jail spaceThousands of children stage school walk out to protest climate changeIsil bride Shamima Begum legal right to return to UK - and Isil threat is \u0026#39definitely not done\u0026#39, MI6 head saysWhy Donald Trump is making the border wall the main issue for the 2020 electionExeter pensioners: suspect charged with murders is polo-playing former public schoolboyChoose an ethnic minority figure as new face of Britain’s £50 note, Treasury urges Bank of EnglandSmart meter roll out set for severe delays as energy firms told to slow down installationsJustice Department discussed forcing Donald Trump out of office, former FBI chief admitsComment: Hardline Brexiteers could trigger a battle for the soul of the Conservative partyTheresa May warned of mass Cabinet resignations if she fails to stop no deal BrexitHome Office funding top London mental health clinic to treat returning jihadists and their childrenScotland Yard investigating allegation of sexual assault made against former Canadian High Commissioner to UK \u0026#39We miss our freedom and independence in the UK\u0026#39 says British family detained in Syria for Isil linksScience Minister backs calls for Kitemark for social media sites to protect children in first interview Poppi Worthington\u0026#39s father received £25k in legal aid to fight inquest Comment: Isil youths like Shamima Begum may be \u0026#39lost\u0026#39, but they are still a radicalised menace to societyRapper boyfriend of actor John Michie\u0026#39s daughter blames parents for not helping her, court hearsDemocrats vow to fight Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39 national emergency as he reveals $8bn border wall planSophie Winkleman interview: \u0026#39I’ve never done really naughty roles because I’m too nervous\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/15/TELEMMGLPICT000188618345_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"family manchester detained syria links isil say miss freedom","story":"Shabina Aslam, 29, and her sister from Manchester speak after fleeing Isil territoryA family from Manchester detained in Syria on suspicion of links to Isil has said they want to return to Britain for a better life for their children after being captured by Western-backed forces.Safiya Zaynab, 51, mother of daughters Shabina Aslam, 29, and Alireza Sabar, 17, from Didsbury said they missed their freedom and wanted to be allowed back home.They claimed a relative told them they were going on holiday to Turkey in 2014 but from there they “ended up in Syria”.“We don’t know how it happened and since then we have been trying to escape, but it has not been possible,” Ms Aslam said.The family was interviewed after being picked up by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near the eastern...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

Instead a new hi-tech version will be fitted in homes.Whereas the older models have been plagued by issues causing them to lose their smart functions when a consumer changes supplier, the new type, which are supposed to fully switchable. However it has emerged that due to technical issues with some of the new style devices, there will not be enough to continue the roll out as planned.   It is a major blow for the roll out as it will mean firms will have to reduce the number of smart meter appointments they make with customers. Conversely consumer group Which? have warned that suppliers needed to treble the number of appointments they are making to meet the Government\u0027s 2020 deadline.Industry sources said the approaching cliff edge has caused chaos for suppliers’ plans with some having run out of the early type of meter already. A source at a large firm said: “There aren’t enough second generation meters to go around. At the moment there’s a mass scramble to try and get hold of them.”Tom Thorp, of Foresight Metering, which provides smart meters to energy firms, said: “We have recommended to all the energy suppliers we work with that there should be a dip in their rollout programme. Part of the reason for slowing down is to make sure we can honour the appointments.” Robert Cheesewright, corporate affairs director at Smart Energy GB, said: There are so many things that this rollout can deal with but it’s now being let down by poor delivery.You don’t have to be a mathematician to know that the rollout won’t be completed by the end of 2020.A spokesman at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, declined to comment. Five dead as gunman opens fire with \u0026#39laser-sighted pistol\u0026#39 at Illinois factoryThousands of criminals GPS tagged in nationwide 247 surveillance scheme to free up jail spaceThousands of children stage school walk out to protest climate changeCaptain Scott lost race to South Pole because he didn\u0026#39t have \u0026#39class clown\u0026#39 in his team, scientists sayIsil bride Shamima Begum legal right to return to UK - and Isil threat is \u0026#39definitely not done\u0026#39, MI6 head saysWhy Donald Trump is making the border wall the main issue for the 2020 electionExeter pensioners: suspect charged with murders is polo-playing former public schoolboyChoose an ethnic minority figure as new face of Britain’s £50 note, Treasury urges Bank of EnglandJustice Department discussed forcing Donald Trump out of office, former FBI chief admitsComment: Hardline Brexiteers could trigger a battle for the soul of the Conservative partyTheresa May warned of mass Cabinet resignations if she fails to stop no deal BrexitHome Office funding top London mental health clinic to treat returning jihadists and their childrenScotland Yard investigating allegation of sexual assault made against former Canadian High Commissioner to UK \u0026#39We miss our freedom and independence in the UK\u0026#39 says British family detained in Syria for Isil links Poppi Worthington\u0026#39s father received £25k in legal aid to fight inquest Science Minister backs calls for Kitemark for social media sites to protect children in first interviewComment: Isil youths like Shamima Begum may be \u0026#39lost\u0026#39, but they are still a radicalised menace to societyRapper boyfriend of actor John Michie\u0026#39s daughter blames parents for not helping her, court hearsDemocrats vow to fight Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39 national emergency as he reveals $8bn border wall planBritain’s new F-35 fighter jets fitted with super-boosted ejector seats because RAF pilots are heavierWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/14/18/insulation.jpg","title":"aerogel insulation weightless space industrial","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Aerogels are a material made up of air that is stuck within a network made of a solid medium, such as ceramic, metal or carbon.Ceramic aerogels can be incredibly lightweight, but still able to endure demanding environments. However, they are usually very brittle and easily degrade, making them hard to use as insulation and limiting their adoption.However, the new ceramic aerogel has been created using atomically thin sheets of a substance known as\u0026nbsphexagonal boron nitride. That was carefully engineered into a new material that does not expand outwards when it is compressed or heated up, unlike other similar materials.It then succeeded in a whole host of tests, including experiments that heated and cooled it rapidly. The aerogel hardly changed at all, the authors right, and did not lose any strength.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby.

After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.The dance was performed by Ribeiro, in character as Carlton Banks, on the Will Smith-starring sitcom back in the 1990s.In 2014,\u0026nbsphe won\u0026nbspDancing with the Stars, the US version of\u0026nbspStrictly Come Dancing.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The losses are not due to any changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU, but instead are “related to expectations of future changes, and uncertainty about future changes”, he said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCompanies have told the central bank that Brexit fears had hit\u0026nbspinvestment, with many scaling back plans for expansion.

Mark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fears“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, as it held the base rate at 0.75 per cent.

Like many other entrepreneurs, she is spending a lot of time in London, masterminding the expansion of Karma in the UK.\u0026nbspSince it launched in London in February 2018, 80,000 users have signed up to click and collect surplus food from delis and restaurants for half price. On any day, users can browse nearby restaurants and cafes for surplus salads, pastries and full meals to buy and collect before closing.\u0026nbspAll that waste has been good for business: Karma is working with 600 independent retailers in London and makes money by taking a cut of sales. Food waste costs businesses in the UK around\u0026nbsp£20bn annually, according to Wrap, the food waste charity –\u0026nbspthe equivalent of more than £300 per citizen.In September, 90 organisations signed a commitment to reduce food waste through the food chain, from field to fork, by working with suppliers and engaging with customers alike. Supermarkets are increasingly seeing apps as part of the solution.\u0026nbspIn November last year, Karma teamed up with appliance manufacturer Electrolux to test out a smart refrigerator for grocery stores. In a trial in Stockholm, users signed up to buy reduced-price chilled goods that would have otherwise gone to waste, unlocking a connected fridge at the entrance to a supermarket with a QR code.Karma has raised €18m\u0026nbsp(£16m) from investors to expand the number of retailers it works with in London and is planning a test launch in Paris in 2019. But Bernadotte says the app works just as well in small towns with just one or two retailers as it does in big cities. She says: “It’s about matching supply and demand.”It’s also about beating the competition. The number of food waste apps on the market has multiplied in the last decade, fuelled by environmental pressure from consumers and industry bodies. Winnow, which launched in London is 2013, provides chefs in commercial kitchens a set of scales to weigh food and measure how much is thrown away. The app can then assess the value of what is being lost, with the idea that restaurants adapt their menus.\u0026nbspOther apps are based on Bernadotte’s notion of matching supply and demand. Tessa Cook co-founded Olio\u0026nbspin the UK in 2015. The app now connects supply and demand for surplus food within communities in 32 countries, with 75 per cent of food listed picked up within 24 hours.\u0026nbspOlio\u0026nbspcurrently makes money by charging business for its Food Waste Heroes Programme, in which a group of volunteers rescue unsold food from businesses and add it to the app. But its core business is connecting people within communities who may only need one red onion, for example, and have another two to give away. Olio\u0026nbspattracted $6m\u0026nbsp(£4.7m) in Series A funding in July led by Octopus Ventures, which was attracted by the value of connecting people through the app.\u0026nbspKarma’s major competition comes Too Good To Go, an app founded in Copenhagen in 2016. It\u0026nbsphas raised a total of €16m\u0026nbspto expand\u0026nbspin Europe. Too Good To Go founder Mette Lykke knows a thing or two about seeing a gap in the market and scaling a business. She previously co-founded Endomondo, an app for tracking and sharing workouts. It sold to Under Armour for $85m\u0026nbspin 2015.\u0026nbsp“The reality is that it’s standard practice for food businesses to throw away perfectly edible food,” she says. “We give them the flexibility to offer up anything that’s still good to eat and sell it to consumers through the app at a discounted price. It’s a win for retailers, because they reduce waste, acquire customers and increase revenue\u0026nbspit’s a win for consumers who get great food for a reduced price –\u0026nbspand it’s obviously a win for the environment.”In France, Too Good To Go is campaigning for Carrefour, the French retail company, to change its food labels from “best before” to “best before, not bad after”. The campaign comes after Tesco scrapped “best before” labels in the UK in October 2018\u0026nbspon more than 100 products. In its native Denmark, Too Good To Go is also working with the country’s minister for education to create webinars to educate children about how to reduce waste at home.\u0026nbspBut its main business is comes from taking a cut of surplus food sales from restaurants and cafes – with a plan to save 20 million\u0026nbspmeals by the end of 2019. Bernadotte says the main difference between the apps is that Karma users know exactly what food they are picking up, which can help with allergies and dietary requirements. Many of the meals on Too Good To Go are listed as “the magic bag”, a mixed bag of any surplus food that a restaurant might otherwise throw away.\u0026nbspHarriet Jenkins is chief operating officer for Detox Kitchen, a health-food home delivery service that has two delis in London. Detox Kitchen switched from using Too Good To Go to Karma after it was contacted by the latter app when it entered the London market in 2018. “Karma was working with a good number of stores and slightly bigger numbers, so we thought we’d experiment with them,” Jenkins says.6 easy ways to prevent food waste at homeDetox Kitchen had long been interested in reducing food waste in its kitchens, but had found it difficult to strike deals with charities because the delis couldn’t guarantee a set amount of waste to make a worthwhile pickup at the end of the day. Through Karma, they could list as much or as little food for half price to be picked up by customers. In the first week of December last year, Detox Kitchen sold 100 units through Karma, raising £230.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a huge boost to revenue, but it’s not about making money – it’s about not losing money by throwing this stuff away,” Jenkins says. “Anything that is raising the profile of our brand is good for us.”With 700 retailers in London, Karma hasn’t even begun to test the potential of the model, according to Bernadotte. “We started off with restaurants and big hotel chains, and now we’re ramping up with grocery stores, supermarkets and school kitchens,” she says. “I haven’t found anyone who doesn’t have any food waste.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

There are hints that it shares an undercurrent of resentment towards The Sun newspaper too.Debate in Britain over the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the EU have focused largely on the economic consequences of the move. The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

This beautiful axehead was found in the Scottish Borders\u0026nbspbut it’s not from Scotland, it’s from central Europe – and it’s been here for 6,000 years.Several floors above, in the museum’s revamped East Asia galleries, curators from a range of countries are celebrating a landmark in the museum’s history. After 15 years, the £80m\u0026nbspoverhaul of this historic institution is finally complete. The project was completed on time\u0026nbspand on budget. The museum’s 29 galleries look magnificent. By any measure, it’s been a spectacular success. More than two million people visit the\u0026nbspmuseum every year, making it Britain’s most popular visitor attraction outside London – not bad for a venue in a city with a population of half a million, and in a country with a population of just five million. However, this relaunch comes at a critical time in Scotland’s national history. When this redevelopment began, in 2004, who would have thought it would be completed just as Scotland braces itself to leave the EU?In case anyone needs reminding (and it seems quite a lot of English voters do), Scots voted to remain in the European Union in 2016, by a considerably larger margin than they voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014. According to English Brexiteers, this “will of the people”\u0026nbspdoesn’t count because Scotland is merely part of the UK, rather than a distinct and separate country – and in a narrow\u0026nbsplegalistic sense they’re right. But as you wander around this museum, which charts the history of the Scottish nation and its relationship with the wider world beyond the British Isles, you realise there’s nothing eternal or automatic about Scotland’s place within the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBrexit putting the union at risk, new poll revealsThe history of the National Museum of Scotland\u0026nbspmirrors Scotland’s shifting relationship with Great Britain over the past few hundred years. The museum’s roots stretch back to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, founded in 1780, at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment, when Edinburgh, then as now, was a European cultural and intellectual hub.In 1861\u0026nbspthe current building was erected here in Chambers Street. Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. Originally called the Industrial Museum of Scotland, it was the UK’s first national museum outside London. The central atrium, flooded with natural light, was inspired by London’s Crystal Palace, where Albert staged his Great Exhibition in 1851. The museum’s mission was “to bring Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland”.\u0026nbspThat mission statement held true in 1861 – it still holds true today.Over the next century, this museum was renamed several times. It was the Edinburgh Museum of Science and\u0026nbspArt, and then the Royal Scottish Museum, before finally becoming the National Museum of Scotland in 1985. In 1998\u0026nbspa modern wing was added to the original Victorian building, and since 2004 the Victorian building has been undergoing an enormous renovation programme. Now finally, after 15 years, that renovation is complete.So is this the\u0026nbspend of the story, the conclusion of a process which began back in 1780? Hardly. A stroll around this museum confirms that history is always unfinished business – particularly here in Scotland, in a national museum in a country which hasn’t been an independent nation for more than 300 years. For visitors, from Britain and abroad, this ambiguous status begs the question: what is the purpose of a national museum in a land that is not (yet) a nation? Is it a sop to rebellious Scots, to appease their nationalist ambitions? Or is it a cultural harbinger of full independence – a sign of things to come?As these displays remind us, England and Scotland have shared a monarch since 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown from the childless Queen Elizabeth I. What’s less widely known – outside Scotland, at least – is that the Scottish parliament stumbled on for another century, until the Act of Union in 1707. Since the foundation of the Scottish parliament, just down the road from here, in 1999, Scotland is back where it was in the 17th century –\u0026nbspa country with its own parliament\u0026nbspbut subservient to Westminster. A century from now, will Scotland be independent again?Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The European Council president launched the scathing attack as he accused anti-EU campaigners of pushing for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” Mr Tusk also dismissed suggestions that the EU could reopen negotiations over the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, dealing a blow to Theresa May‘s hopes of securing fresh concessions as she tries to get her exit deal through parliament. Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4242 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadScotland isn’t the only European nation within a nation, and several of these quasi-nations have their own national museums. Their respective histories reveal a good deal about these statelets’ differing attitudes to independence. The Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich was founded in 1855\u0026nbspby King Maximilian II of Bavaria, when the region was still an independent nation. Bavaria voted for union with the Deutsches Reich in 1871, and has remained part of Germany ever since, yet it retains many of the cultural trappings of a nation state, including this national museum. A significant minority of Bavarians still pine for a return to statehood (a YouGov poll in 2017, at the height of the refugee crisis, put the number as high as 32 per cent), but as immigration falls it looks as if these separatist ambitions have peaked.Conversely, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, in Barcelona, reflects far stronger independence aspirations. Despite its long history as an independent country, Catalonia has been part of Spain since 1715, and until 2004 the Palau Nacional in Barcelona merely housed the Museu d’Art de Catalunya. In 2004 it was renamed the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, and in 2017, when Catalonia held an (illegal) independence referendum, the Palau Nacional was a popular focal point for pro-independence demonstrations.At present, Scottish independence seems to sit somewhere between these two positions. In 2014 Scots voted to remain in the UK, by 55.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 44.7\u0026nbspper cent, but Scotland’s subsequent vote to remain in the EU, by 62 per cent\u0026nbspto 38 per cent, puts the Scottish parliament on a collision course with Westminster. The National Museum of Scotland is careful not to take sides in these isive debates. They don’t need to. The exhibits speak for themselves. Scotland may leave the EU\u0026nbspand may remain in the UK, but the contents of this museum show Scotland has always been a European country, as much as a British one.Entering the wing of the museum\u0026nbspdevoted to Scottish history, you’re confronted by a cri de coeur from Robert the Bruce: “As long as one hundred of us remain alive, we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.”\u0026nbspOn the opposite wall is a similarly stirring pronouncement from the Declaration of Arbroath (the letter the barons of Scotland sent to Pope John XXII in 1320, confirming Scotland’s independence, and its right to resist the English by force): “For we fight not for glory nor riches nor honours, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up except with his life.”For an English visitor in particular, what is unfamiliar (and instructive) about this display is the pan-European focus, and the refreshing absence of Anglo-centric emphasis. You realise that, for long periods of its history, Scotland’s relationship with England was nothing special. The Romans occupied all of England for several centuries and left a lasting mark upon it. Their partial incursions into Scotland were short and insubstantial. During the dark ages, Scotland enjoyed closer links with Ireland than England. As the old Roman roads crumbled away, it became far easier for Scots to sail to Ireland than to trek to England. The Irish Sea wasn’t a barrier\u0026nbspbut a busy highway.There was nothing inevitable or preordained about the Act of Union in 1707. Like a lot of historical turning points, it owed a good deal to happenstance. At the end of the 17th century, despite having shared the same monarch for almost 100 years, the Kingdom of Scotland was still independent. And with better luck and better judgement it might well have remained so. If only the Scottish government hadn’t invested a quarter of Scotland’s wealth in a new colony in Panama, it might still be independent today.Like a lot of heroic failures, the idea was inspired. By establishing a base in Panama, on the isthmus between North and South America, Scotland would control the growing trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, anticipating the Panama canal by 200 years. Mindful of the Romans, and the new empire they hoped to build, they called this new colony Caledonia.If Caledonia had been successful, Scotland might have become a world power, with no need of England. However, the English government did its best to scupper the venture, colluding with the East India Company in a trade blockade. The colony collapsed, sparking a financial crisis\u0026nbspin Edinburgh. If anything, the collapse in national confidence was even more severe. Seven years later the Scottish parliament voted narrowly for union with England – and that was the end of the Scottish parliament\u0026nbspuntil 1999.Of course this isn’t new information, but it’s a shock to English eyes to see it presented here so prominently, and so starkly, rather than buried in the footnotes of a dry and dusty history book. I studied this stuff when I did my history degree, but I never knew about the £20,000 in bribes the English paid to Scottish politicians to push the Act of Union through the Scottish parliament, and vote for their own extinction. In the light of this betrayal, the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 make a lot more sense.Hunting with dogs to be ‘effectively halted’ in Scotland Women win equal pay dispute after 12-year battle with Glasgow councilCross-party rally calls for second referendum in ScotlandThe top floor of the museum is devoted to Scotland in the 20th century. The exhibition Scotland:\u0026nbspA Changing Nation is a vivid picture of where Scotland stands today. Here you’ll find Jimmy Reid, the Scottish trade unionist, and Winifred Ewing, the pioneering SNP politician. Here you’ll find Margaret Thatcher, opining that:\u0026nbsp“We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.”\u0026nbspThe display lets you draw your own conclusions. The exhibition concludes with the opening of the Scottish parliament, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles. “We have a building which is more than a building,”\u0026nbspsaid the Scots poet Edwin Morgan, and he’s right.So what does the rebirth of this museum tell us about the rebirth of Scottish nationalism? This museum isn’t a nationalistic project, as its curators are at pains to point out. The National Museum of Scotland is devoutly, resolutely apolitical. It flies no flag for any party. Yet Scottish politics has flowed in a very different direction since 1998\u0026nbspwhen this museum was last expanded: an independence referendum (defeated) an EU membership referendum (won in Scotland\u0026nbspbut lost across the UK, thanks to Brexit votes in England)\u0026nbspand a resurrected Scottish parliament, reconvened after 200 years.In party politics, the biggest story by far has been the rise of the Scottish National Party, now the governing party here in Scotland. These have been seismic changes, and though this museum’s impartiality is admirable, it wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t reflect this tectonic shift.The internationalism of this museum, and the growing internationalism of Scotland, is reflected in this museum’s perspective, and the nationalities of its staff. The three curators I spoke to, entirely at random, were Chinese, French and German. Time was, talent tended to drift south from Scotland. Now, increasingly, it’s the other way around. The museum’s director, Dr Gordon Rintoul,\u0026nbspis a Scot who returned to Scotland from England.“We’ve certainly attracted a substantial number of people from outside Scotland, and I think people have come here because they sense an opportunity to do something different, an opportunity to make a difference,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. His curator of Chinese collections, Dr Qin Cao, is a case in point. Originally from China, she worked in London and Oxford before she relocated to Edinburgh. “It is a very vibrant place,”\u0026nbspshe says.“We have so many visitors coming from all over the world,”\u0026nbspsays Friederike Voigt, a senior curator\u0026nbspwho was born and raised in Germany. “In a way what makes Scotland great is the same thing that makes this museum great,”\u0026nbspsays Dr Xavier Dectot, keeper of art and\u0026nbspdesign at the musuem, who comes from France. I know what he means. It’s big enough, but it’s small enough. People feel connected here.“There’s a greater awareness that we’re actually dependent on other people, so we want to interact,”\u0026nbspadds Voigt. “It’s very outward looking,”\u0026nbspconcurs Dectot. “Not only do we feel Scottish, but the other Scots don’t perceive us as anything but Scots.”\u0026nbspIf only this were true in England.“A large part of what defines the architecture of this city is late 18th century – neoclassical – that’s something that is very European,”\u0026nbspsays Dectot, who personifies Scotland’s Auld Alliance\u0026nbspwith France, and its cultural affinity with the continent. And now the street life is catching up. The city always used to feel cosmopolitan in August\u0026nbspduring Edinburgh\u0026nbspFestival Fringe. Now it feels cosmopolitan all year round. “Everyone in the city has responded to that,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. “That does actually give the city a more international feel.”Scottish devolution has had a direct effect on the evolution of this museum. “A key point for this project was the strong support from Scottish government,”\u0026nbspRintoul tells me. It doesn’t hurt that the Scottish parliament, in Holyrood, is just a short walk\u0026nbspfrom the museum. “It’s clearly easier to argue your case.”\u0026nbspIt’s also clearly easier to secure public funding when the public keep coming in such numbers. The museum’s recent Mary Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlie exhibitions were both hugely popular. Their popularity reveals a growing appetite for Scottish heritage, particularly for shows like these, which re-evaluate the mythic elements of Scotland’s past.There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago“Since the time of devolution there’s been\u0026nbspmuch increased interest in Scotland’s history. There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago.”Although Edinburgh feels more international now, Scots internationalism is nothing new. “Scots have always engaged with the rest of the world. These galleries, throughout the whole museum, are replete with items that were acquired by Scots who were abroad, as missionaries\u0026nbspor to seek their fortune\u0026nbspor in military service, and bringing things back to Scotland.”Speaking personally, as a Londoner who’s spent more time in Edinburgh than in any city outside London, I grow to love Scotland more with every visit, but I also become more and more aware of how different it is from England. Without Brexit, the National Museum of Scotland might have remained what it has been for more than a century – an expression of national identity for a nation within a nation – a Bavarian model, if you like. After Brexit, it looks destined to become the focal point for a more Catalan model, whether these curators like it or not. What an exquisite irony that the Conservative and\u0026nbspUnionist Party, of all parties, has brought the Act of Union to its current crisis point! What a fascinating exhibition that will make, in 20 or 30 years to come.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That light is invisible to the human eye but is a useful tool for exploring the universe: it will give astronomers a look at more than 300 million galaxies, as well as 100 million stars in our Milky Way.This amazing mission will be a treasure trove of unique data for astronomers,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement. “It will deliver an unprecedented galactic map containing ‘fingerprints’ from the first moments in the universe’s history. And we’ll have new clues to one of the greatest mysteries in science: What made the universe expand so quickly less than a nanosecond after the big bang?”To answer those questions, SPHEREx will look out at all those galaxies, some of which are so far away that the light reaching us has taken 10 billion years to travel through the universe. It will hunt out water and organic molecules in the hope that we can understand where – and how often – those ingredients for life occur throughout the cosmos.It will also look out\u0026nbspto create\u0026nbspmap of the entire sky, in 96 different colour bands.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalAstronaut Tim Peake previously revealed the damage that orbital junk can cause spacecraft, when he shared an image of a chipped window panel on board the International Space Station in 2016.It is believed that something as small as a paint chip could have caused the damage, as it hurtled towards the International Space Station.When in full operation, scientists aim to make the harpoon fire at debris up to 30 metres away.Engineers back on Earth are still trying to work out how the system can be used to target moving objects.A previous RemoveDEBRIS\u0026nbspexperiment demonstrated how a net could be used to catch potentially dangerous pieces of rubbish orbiting the Earth. Next, the group are expected to test the drag sail part of the test on 12 March.\u0026nbsp“Successful in-space demonstration of the harpoon technology is a significant step towards solving the growing issue of space debris, said Chris Burgess, Harpoon Lead Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, added: “This is RemoveDEBRIS’ most demanding experiment and the fact that it was a success is testament to all involved.\u0026nbspThe RemoveDEBRIS project provides strong evidence of what can be achieved with the power of collaboration – pooling together the experience across industry and the research field to achieve something truly remarkable.”Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct.

But the truth is we\u0027re finding it harder and harder to do.It starts to bring into question whether in fact the government is able to operate in the national interest at all.We are facing a great crisis and we are not really looking at all the options for trying to resolve it.Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspsaid the EU\u0027s solidarity with Ireland is resolute, despite Theresa May urging Brussels to agree to changes to the backstop.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpeaking at Dublin Castle, he said:\u0026nbspNo matter what happens we know that Northern Ireland citizens will have the right to travel anywhere in the EU from Athens to Athenrye.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.One leading Tory described the night as a “fiasco”, Jeremy Corbyn said the country was heading for a “catastrophe”, and a senior source in Brussels said: “There goes the strong mandate.”The Brexit fault line also cut through Mr Corbyn’s party on Thursday, with a significant number of Labour MPs apparently defying their leader’s will in a separate vote\u0026nbspamid suspicions that some are close to breaking away.Corbyn suffers revolt as 41 Labour MPs back ‘immediate’ Brexit delayBut the spotlight was firmly on the prime minister’s ailing administration as it contorted in an attempt to avoid defeat on what did not have to be a difficult night for Ms May.The wording of Thursday’s motion called on MPs to reiterate their support for the approach set out in an earlier set of votes on 29 January, when the Commons backed a plan to reopen negotiations with Brussels on the withdrawal agreement –\u0026nbspbut also voted for a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit.After the government apparently combined\u0026nbspsupport for both issues in Thursday’s motion, rather than just focussing on renegotiating with the EU, Tory Euroceptics who want to keep no deal on the table found themselves unable to back Ms May’s position.It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness createdGovernment whips tried and failed in the hours running up to the vote\u0026nbspto convince Brexiteers that backing the government on Thursday would not take no deal off the table.After the defeat, prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin MP said: “It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness created.“I don’t know why the government doesn’t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 Eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the withdrawal agreement – not one of us was consulted.”The ision list showed the government’s Brexit motion was supported by 243 of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s MPs.\u0026nbspWhile just five of them voted against it, many Tories in the\u0026nbspBrexit-backing\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) abstained, robbing Ms May of her majority.Steve Baker, vice-chair of the ERG, said its members were not prepared to be “coopted into taking no deal off the table”, but he insisted that Ms May retains “a clear mandate” from last month’s vote to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.He said: “It’s time for some people to grow up and think about what is in the national interest.\u0026nbspThat is standing firm that we are leaving and then negotiating with the EU to get an acceptable deal.”Mr Corbyn demanded the prime minister come back to the chamber with a “coherent plan” following the defeat, claiming the vote showed there is no majority for her course of action.He went on: “The government cannot keep on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29\u0026nbspMarch without a coherent plan.“She can’t keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face.”A Downing Street spokesman accused Mr Corbyn of putting “partisan considerations” ahead of the national interest and voting in a way to make a no-deal scenario more likely.He added: “While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage.The spokesman said the government will now continue to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to secure Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March.But the defeat does not bode well for a more significant set of votes coming on 27 February, when parliament could well use Commons amendments to take control of the process away from Ms May and delay\u0026nbspBrexit.Pro-Europe Tory\u0026nbspAnna Soubry\u0026nbspsaid: “This is a serious blow to the credibility of the prime minister. We are in such a mess, I’m afraid, that parliament is going to have to take back control of this.“It is a symbol of the profound lack of leadership in both political parties.”Mr Corbyn also suffered a major revolt when dozens of his own MPs backed an\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspcall for an “immediate” move to delay Brexit by extending\u0026nbspArticle 50.The Labour leader had ordered his MPs to abstain – but he was defied by 41 who voted with the Scottish Nationalists for a suspension of “no fewer than three months”, past 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Somehow, they’ll stop it.” I don’t think I was alone in reckoning that.It’s looking very much like that at the moment, isn’t it  We’re  days away from deadline time, March . But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so. They were never going to let it happen.”Congratulations to young Hartlepool lad Michael Rice for becoming our entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest.He’s singing a ditty called Love Is Really Lovely or something, and will come third from last, just above Kosovo and France.Michael Rice will represent the UK at Eurovision but will probably come third from lastBut bless him, at least he’ll be going.Far left, anti-Semitic bullies have been demanding we boycott the extravaganza because it’s in Israel.A bunch of C-list celebs wrote a letterinsisting we pull out.They said nothing when the contest was held in the repressive Islamic state of Azerbaijan.Good luck, Michael.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So British workers, who earn an average of £, a year, are each getting richer by £ a week, every week.Not that you may have heard the good news on inflation and real wages.As ever, it was drowned out by the relentless drone of bad news stories, all trying to convince us that Britain is in an economic crash, caused by Brexit.In this fictional version of Britain’s economic health we are all getting poorer. Factories are closing like never before and jobs are drting away to the rest of the EU.Yesterday, for example, thegave prominence to a claim by a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, that Brexit is already costing us £million a week.It was fantasy, based on Mr Vlieghe’s guess that the economy would have been two per cent larger had we not voted to leave the EU.Why should anyone believe him when the Bank of England’s economic forecasters have such a terrible record A month before the  referendum, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, predicted Britain could fall into a “technical recession”we voted to leave.It didn’t happen — or even come close to happening.Then on Wednesday, Carney stunned many with a speech saying Brexit could usher in a golden era of “international co-operation and crossborder commerce” and even that it could be a springboard to a “new global order” of free trade.It is true that economic growth in Britain is sluggish by historical standards, but then it has been ever since the economic crash of  .But at . per cent growth in the past three months, it is outpacing Germany, where the economy was static over the same period. Italy is in recession.It is more than six years since Britain saw the economy shrink over the course of three months, and more than nine years since the economy shrank by more than two quarters in a row — the official definition of a recession.We might not be booming, in other words, but we have gone a remarkably long period without a bust.As for jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen to four per cent — the lowest since the first three months of .Employment, however, is far higher than it was then.We are in the middle of a jobs miracle, yet you would never guess this from listening to many news bulletins.Last week, we never heard the end of it when Nissan announced that it would not, after all, be building its new X-Trail model in Sunderland. You had to read a little more deeply to realise that not a single job is being lost at Britain’s Nissan plants and that the X-Trail is only being dropped because European consumers have turned against diesel.In France, by the way, the unemployment rate is . per cent and in Italy it is . per cent. So much for the notion that the Eurozone economy is powering ahead while Brexit Britain lags behind.Ever since the referendum, the economy has defied the doom-mongers. The past month has been no exception.The High Street was predicted to be a bloodbath. Yet several large chains, including Next, Dunelm and Pets At Home, reported strongly rising sales in the weeks up to Christmas.We have continued shopping after Christmas, too. Consumer spending in January was . per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Barclaycard.The stock market and housing market have both failed to crash, as many predicted they would. In fact, the FTSE  is up seven per cent this year.House prices, according to the Government’s index, are up . per cent over the past  months. That’s no rampant boom, but it is certainly nowhere near a crash.The one thing on which economists were right was that the Pound would fall after a Brexit vote.It is  per cent lower than in early .That is bad newsyou are going on a foreign holiday. Butyou have a job in a company which exports goods or services, it is a pretty good thing.By increasing exports and decreasing imports, the lower Pound is helping to reduce Britain’s trade deficit.In  we imported £billion more in goods and services than we exported. In  the deficit grew to £billion. But by , once the lower Pound had taken effect, it was £billion. However former Brexit Secretary David Davis was wrong when he pinned hopes this week of a sizeable, long-term export boost on a devaluation of the Pound.Brexit success depends on cutting taxes, trade barriers and regulatory burdens, just as Singapore has done.No matter how positive the economic data, however, there are many Remainers who simply will not accept that the economy is not crashing.They want that to happen because they want to be proved right. It is surprising the relentless tales of doom have not caused a recession by destroying consumers’ confidence.If we had taken notice of what the Eeyores were trying to tell us about economic collapse and stopped spending, recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Evidently, British consumers have the good sense to see the forecasts of doom as the anti-Brexit propaganda that they are.The economy is not roaring ahead, but strip away the gloomy headlines and there is more good news than bad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This test is consistent with that.“With a recovery rate of  per cent that’s equivalent to  years’ worth of gas for the country. We believe this really is something to shout about.”Ineos is now urging the Government to get fully behind fracking revolution by speeding up the planning process. It took two years to get the green light to drill a test well at its Tinker Lane sight in Nottinghamshire – when it hoped to begin within  weeks.And it wants Ministers to honour a commitment to review strict rules that force firms to suspend fracking when earth tremors hit . on the Richter scale – equivalent to a kid bouncing a football.Rival fracker Cuadrilla lost a planning appeal to drill in Fylde Lancashire after Communities Secretary James Brokenshire raised concerns over traffic congestion. The Government has also yet to announce whether it will remove the need for planning permission to drill exploratory shale wells like the one Ineos has just completed.Mr Pickering said: “The industry is committed to the safe development of fracking. But now is the time for Ministers to really get behind it.”‘Fracking’ has transformed America’s energy sector by discovering vast quantities of gas and oil from shale rock. Analysts believe new discoveries will allow the US to become a net oil exporter by the late s – ending a decades long addiction to energy imports.Under fracking, companies use a high pressure water mixture to ‘fracture’ rock and release the gas inside.Reserves of shale gas have been identied across large swathes of northern England but fierce pressure and legal challenges from green campaigners have led to huge delays in planning approvals.Mr Pickering said: “With Brexit just around the corner and the UK increasingly dependent on expensive foreign gas, now is the time for strong leadership to take advantage of a once in a generation opportunity.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would never have crossed my mind.How can they expect me to afford to pay It has ruined my le. I cantas a normal person or think straight.It has caused me depression and Ive had to go to the doctors.It has put a massive strain on my relationship with friends and family. Ive been in la la land since I got the first letter.I just couldnt believe it. I cant understand how they can do this, it seems impossible.Theyve clearly made a massive mistake and its of no fault of my own.Antony has lived in the flat, in Chadwell Street, Islington, since , and originally rented it from the council.He bought it from the authority under the Right To Buy scheme in , and because hed lived there for so long he got an £, discount.The council priced it at £, in August  and he got a £, mortgage - for the remaining amount after the discount - in .He was previously paying £ a week in rent but now pays around £, a month in mortgage repayments.But two years later, in , Antony received a shocking letter from the council explaining the blunder, and demanding the remaining £,.The council admitted it valued the home as a one-bed in a desktop valuation - a way of valuing a property or business using existing information.In legal documents, Antony - via solicitor Peter Felton of Feltons Law - alleges it was due to an error in the councils computerised records.But Antony claims before the sale took place, an independent surveyor conducted a site survey of the flat.The bedroom in question is a box room and Antony claims it was mentioned on his lease, drawn up by the council.The council is claiming security guard, Antony, has been unjustly enriched by the apparent admin blunder.In a letter to Antony in March , the council explained where a public body acts outside their jurisdiction, their decision is void.It also included the councils admission that it had no power to dispose of the premises at a lower valuation than that based on market value.As a result, the council is entitled to recover the funds, by way of restitution for unjust enrichment, the letter said.Lawyers acting on behalf of the council tried to settle outside of court and offered Antony the option to agree terms for restoration of the balance of the purchase price.But the two parties failed to agree terms, and in a letter sent to Antony in October , he was issued an ultimatum - either accept liability to pay up, or enter a legal battle.Court papers prepared for proceedings say the council has a duty to recover the missing £,, as they acted outside their statutory powers by granting the lease at an undervalue.In a letter, sent in October , the council offered Antony a final  day window in which to settle the dispute outside of legal proceedings, and warned of lodging a claim against himhe still refused to pay.Both parties have prepared court papers but a start date for proceedings is yet to be confirmed.Worried Antony said: Up until  everything was completely fine. I first heard about all of this when the council sent me a pretty aggressive letter.It even said we understand this letter may cause you some distress.They told me by letter my property had been undervalued and we need to resolve the £, I now owe them.Even my barrister has said he has no idea what the outcome will be.I have no idea how they can justy asking for that much more money. It has always been a two-bed flat. It was never a one-bed.Its madness really. They have doubled the price of a property based on a box room.Antony says he is the victim of an admin error and is being punished for something out of his control.The council and Antony are due to begin legal proceedings at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court but are awaiting confirmation on a date.Antony has enlisted the help of solicitors for the upcoming legal battle and says he is adamant hell keep his home.His defence barrister, Christopher Royal QC, claims there is no reported case of a former landlord claiming damages from the former tenant due to an undervaluation.But the homeowner fears evenhe wins in court, hell have to sell his flat to pay for the legal bill - which he fears could top £,.He said: No matter what happens I will have to sell the property to pay my legal fees.If I win Ill get the fee back for my barrister but Ill have to pay some costs for my solicitor and mortgage company.I will probably be unable to live in London anymore. Ill be bankruptI lose.Antony says he took the decision to buy the flat for the benefit of his children and wanted to ensure he leaves a legacy for them in London.He said: I wasnt surprised at the price when I bought it. It was the first time Id ever bought a property so it seemed a lot of money to me.I wanted to get on the property ladder for my children and I was really happy.I wanted to make my childrens lives easier for when they want a home.I thought it was odd how they valued it on a computer but I was ensured it was normal.The effect on me has been incredible. It has ruled my le for four years.I dont wish I never bought it in the first place. I got a lot of fulfilment from it.The most unjust part of it is I will still lose the property evenI win. I cant get my head around it, evenI win I know Ill still be losing.Islington Borough Council has not responded to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000469124481.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jihadi bride shamima begums family demand government bring her home where she belongs claiming shes pregnant and vulnerable","story":"Pregnant Shamima Begum, , this week resurfaced after fleeing to Syria to join IS as a Bethnal Green high school student with two pals in .She was discovered by a Times journalist in a camp filled with refugees escaping the battle for the final ISIS stronghold - telling him she didnt regret joining the murderous cult but would now do anything possible to get home.And today, her elder sister Renu told ITV News she was desperate for the teen to come home.She pleaded: Shes pregnant and vulnerable, and it’s important we get her out of al-Hawl camp and home as soon as possible.We hope the British Government will help us bring her home to us where she belongs.The teens family has previously admitted they understood she would not be welcome.Speaking on behalf of the family, Mr Rehman told MailOnline: “As a family we cant understand how her head was turned like this and why she thought going to Syria was a good idea.“I can understand why people in this country are angry and dont want her back. What shes done doesnt portray Islam in a good light.”While her family pleas for compassion the teen shows no sign of repentance.During interviews she even called herself “weak” for leaving ISIS and praised those who stayed to fight with the death cult.Meanwhile critics are furious at the thought of her picking up her le at home in Bethnal Green, East London.Security minister Ben Wallace said British lives will not be risked trying to rescue the jihadi bride.He added thatshe does make it back to the UK she will face prosecution “at the very least”.Mr Wallace said today: “Shes a British citizen, she has rights. Thats the reality of it. Its not about me or anyone  saying you cant come.“You have rights. But you know, dont be surprised by what reception you get when you come back when it comes to investigations and law enforcement.”Ex UKIP leader turned LBC radio host Nigel Farage was also among those calling for the government to stop Begum ing to Britain.He fumed: “This woman shows no remorse for her actions, remains a committed jihadist and is totally unsuitable to come into our country.”Begum made the plea toto the UK after telling reporters she could give birth “any day now”.Her pregnancy comes after her first two children died of starvation and illness, with Begum hoping the baby can have a decent le with her in the UK.Speaking to a Times reporter who tracked her down she said: Im scared this baby is going to get sick in this camp.Thats why I really want to get back to Britain.Because I know it will be taken care of, healthwise at least.And she calmly revealed that the first time she saw a severed head “didn’t faze me at all”.She revealed she had been married to a Dutch fighter and but now believes she is a widow.But shockingly just one in ten have been prosecuted for direct action theyve carried out in Syria.Around  per cent of the  Brits believed to have travelled to Syria or Iraq have died.The Home Office says every person who s is questioned by police and an assessment made over whether they are a threat to Britain.However few have been prosecuted.The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill is currently going through Parliament, after its third reading in the House of Lords.This could make travelling abroad to join terror groups an offence which carries a penalty of ten years in prison.Security Minister Ben Wallace said: The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.Everyone who s from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by the police to determinethey have committed criminal offences, and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.There are a range of terrorism offences where iniduals can be convicted for crimes committed overseas and we can also use Temporary Exclusion Orders to control an inidualsto the UK.She added: “I know what everyone at home thinks of me as I have read all that was written about me online. But I just want to come home to have my child. I’ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child.”Discussing what made her walk away from the embattled village of Baghuz, Begum described herself as “weak” for leaving ISIS and praised those brave enough to stay.She added: “In the end, I just could not endure anymore. I just couldn’t take it. Now all I want to do is come home to Britain.”The teen also criticised the group’s oppression and corruption saying they didn’t “deserve victory”.But she insisted: “I’m not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago and I don’t regret coming here.Begum - who used her elder sister’s passport to leave the UK - fled with two Bethnal Green Academy pals, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, in February .The trio flew to Turkey and then used people smugglers to cross the border into Syria.She believed that her two Bethnal Green friends were still alive as recently as two weeks ago, but Sultana is widely thought to have been killed in a Raqqa airstrike in .Amiras dad has now said the girls pose no threat as he begged for them to be allowed home.Yes, she was only  when she left London. But she was old enough to know right from wrong — to know IS were an evil army of terrorist cut-throats.Even now she has “no regrets” about supporting the Islamist butchers as they raped and massacred women and children and beheaded hostages. She seems proud she was unmoved by the sight of an enemy’s head in a bin.No remorse. No tears for the family le she abandoned in Bethnal Green. No nostalgic longing for our food, telly or shops. No hint her mind has changed.Begum simply no longer has “high hopes” IS will survive and wants taxpayers to look after her and her baby.We won’t.Security Minister Ben Wallace rightly won’t lt a finger. He says she will face justiceshe turns up. Let’s go further: Strip her of her citizenship. Stop her at the border. She is eligible to become Bangladeshi. Let her try her luck there.Begum would eradicate our way of leshe could. Why should we pay to house or police her Anyone who s to the UK after travelling to ISIS territory faces a criminal investigation and up to ten years in jail.The Sun revealed that permanent exclusion could be an option for the teen.It emerged the legal test to exclude the we of an ISIS fighter from the UK is whether she is eligible to claim citizenship where. Her parents are from Bangladesh — raising the bar to re-entry here.Other alternatives could see the teen prosecuted in her absence for being in a designated terror area — or to allow her tobut under heavy monitoring.Critics today argued Begums lack of remorse shows she is a danger to Britain.Dr Kim Howells, a former Foreign Office and Counter-Terrorism Minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: She sounds to be completely unrepentant, she sounds cynical, she said she wasnt phased by the sight of these heads in a bin as she described it. And now she wants to take advantage of the NHS.You can bet your bottom dollar there will be a lobby that will swing into action to get this girl home on humanitarian grounds.Theres not going to be many people with great enthusiasm for bringing her back, but I suspect she will make it in the end.An ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner spoke out on Good Morning Britain today, questioning what danger the pregnant teen would pose."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000249511092.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum left kids asleep on sofa to go clubbing","story":"Kylie Taylors four-year-old and two-year-old sons were left to fend for themselves in the family home, Bolton Crown Court heard.After a neighbour called police, Taylor was tracked down to a  nightclub in Bradshawgate  just before am where she was described as being intoxicated and somewhat unhelpful by prosecutors.Taylor, , initially claimed that her sons were with their mother, but they were found in the filthy property at am alone and asleep.She later claimed the home was in such a state because shed had an abortion only a week earlier.Taylor, who no longer lives with her sons, is described as being remorseful over the incident.The mum-of-two was spared jailed because her children were not physically harmed, the judge said.Taylor had banged on a neighbours door just after am on May , , and asked them to call a taxi.The taxi arrived but the neighbour phoned the police, the court heard.Neil Fryman, prosecuting, said the neighbour was concerned that the defendant was out at the time and the children might be home alone.Police tracked Taylor down to McCauleys nightclub in Bradshawgate just before am.Taylor initially attempted to trick police and said her children were with her partner or at his mothers home in Farnworth, but checks revealed they were home alone.There were broken objects on the floor, no food in the kitchen and a toilet was overflowing when police arrived at am.Five minutes later Taylors partner, Dylan Fahy, arrived at the property and said he had left Taylor looking after the children.Both parents were arrested but charges against Fahy were not proceeded with and allowed to lie on file.Taylor pleaded guilty to child neglect.She told police that she and Fahy had an argument and she had left the house thinking he was upstairs.Virginia Hayton, defending, told the court that the children no longer live with Taylor, although she hopes to be reunited with them one day, and her relationship with Fahy is over.Miss Hayton added that the criminal proceedings against her have been a real wake up call and that Taylor no longer drinks or takes illegal drugs.Miss Hayton said: Her main focus has been securing the welfare of the children.She wants to show the children she can be a good mother.She is remorseful.She knows she let the children down on this occasion.Thankfully, there was no physical harm.Judge Graeme Smith sentenced Taylor to a community order for  months with conditions that she undertakes  hours of unpaid work and participates in  days of rehabilitation activities.He told her: Being a parent is an enormous responsibility.Very small areas of neglect can lead to devastating consequences.Having failed to carry out the responsibility of being a parent, you have lost that privilege.He added that although it was a reckless and foolish action to go out without checking on the welfare of the children, they had not been physically harmed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0003585498791.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british family ban burger king new zealand behaviour holiday","story":"The burger chain barred the now infamous family from Liverpool after they allegedly used their children as scavengers in a fast-food scam.According to the New Zealand Herald, the shameless brood swizzed free meals from Burger King staff by taking uneaten food from other people’s tables back to the counter and complaining about it being cold.The kids allegedly were sent to scavenge leftover food for the family to use in the scam.Drinks would be poured on their food before complaining.The ban was revealed by New Zealand Police who said they had been alerted to the family’s scheme by Burger King staff from a restaurant in Hamilton. The family would also order food and partially eat it before waiting y periods for it to go cold. They would then send it back complaining it was cold.The documents, which were obtained using the Official Information Act , have shed new light on the family’s shocking behaviour last month while they holidayed in the country. A briefing noted: “The family appeared to use the children as tools in assisting with this and getting them to take old food from customers’ deserted tables, then trying to demand a refund with the cold food,” the briefing information noted.“When refused a refund replacement food … the family would become aggressive … banging the counters in the arcade, as well as swearing.”After being caught, all family members were issued with trespass notices, effectively banning them from all  Burger King restaurants across New Zealand.The restaurant staff and Burger King did not pursue further formal complaints against the Dorans.The group made world headlines after they wreaked havoc during their stay. Following a public outcry, members of the family were threatened with deportationthey did not leave within  days.  Local reports described them as Irish travellers, but the family said they were British citizens and not gypsies.One claimed: Im just a fat kid from England on holiday.The same family were accused of leaving restaurants without paying, creating havoc in a drive-thru Burger King, and causing a stink on the worst flight ever.Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff didn’t hold back in sharing his thoughts, blasting the visitors as worse than pigs.NZ Herald reports he told a radio station: “What a bunch of a**holes, these guys are trash.Shocking footage also showed a young lad threatening to knock the brains out of a woman who filmed them littering on a picturesque beach.A petition was started by locals demanding “Deport the unruly tourists” after the week-long trail of carnage.The petition reads: “These tourists have come to our country, scammed our local businesses and littered along our beaches.“Get rid of them now to teach a lesson to future tourists that we do not accept such behaviour in our Homeland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"council force parents remove flowers grave hull","story":"Kelly Desborough and Tony Wilson, both , were sent a letter by Hull City Council telling them the tributes they had placed around baby Ebonies grave were unauthorised memorabilia which needed to be removed.The couple had decorated their daughter Ebonies resting place in Eastern Cemetery, Hull, with pink flowers and toys.The heartless note said the items were encroaching on to the neighbouring grave and causing an obstruction to the councils grass cutting machinery.Kelly and Tony say they are heartbroken they have been told to remove the items from the grave, which has been designed as a fairy garden and they say has remained the same since Ebonie was laid to rest there three years ago.They also say the way the council has handled it is insensitive and has re-opened old wounds.Ms Desborough. said: I cried my eyes out when I read the letter sent by the council - it was just how they sent it with absolutely no warning or consideration of how it would make us feel.The letter was completely generic and treated us just as a number, and there was nothing in there of meeting face to face to discuss things, as we had no idea there was a problem after three years of the grave being there.Losing a child never leaves you, and asking for Ebonies grave to be changed has just reopened old wounds, especially with the way the council have gone about it, which I think is disgusting.Im heartbroken at the thought of changing the grave, which we have made in to a fairy garden to visit with the kids as a family - the way we have set up Ebonies grave has given us all a connection to her and we often rearrange the stones on it.Ms Desborough says the fairy garden grave is her only link to her little girl.The family often visit the grave with their two older children, who they say have formed a connection with their little sister through the decorations.She added: I remember being in hospital and the staff there telling me that I had to decide whether to bury or cremate my baby before she was even born, and I just couldnt take any of it in.In the end we chose a burial, and now Ebonies grave is the only thing that Ive got to connect me to her as I have nothing  of her, only the garden that we created at the cemetery.A part of me went with her when I lost Ebonie and I have to try and build myself up everyday - the scars are there and now more wounds are being added.If I knew the rules around the graves to begin with, I would have followed them, but to ask us to change the grave now seems so unfair.Dad Tony Wilson says he is disgusted at how the council have handled the matter.He said: We take our -year-old and seven-year old kids to Ebonies grave and also our baby girl - our eldest have made a connection with their sister through her fairy garden, and we cant now tell them that it has to come down, as theyd just be so devastated.Making the plot look nice is really important, as otherwise its just a depressing piece of grass, but with the garden weve created, it looks really nice.Its disgusting, me and my partner have been crying about being told to take it down - its absolutely s***.Its not just us affected either, as there are lots of plots near Ebonies where babies are buried, so a lot of parents will be grieving again like us when theyre given the news that they need to scale back their plots.The letter sent to Ms Desborough reads: Please accept my sincere apologies for having to contact you on this matter you are recorded as being the applicant for the burial of baby Ebonie Rose Wilson.It has come to my attention that unauthorised memorabilia has been placed on and around the above grave.Unfortunately this is encroaching on the neighbouring grave and also causing an obstruction to the councils grass cutting machinery, preventing the council from maintaining and preparing the area for burials.In addition, it will obstruct any masonry work the neighbouring grave is having done.I must ask that you make arrangements for this to be moved.I would like to thank you for your understanding in thus matter, and should you have any queries or concerns, please do not hesitate to speak to me on the above telephone number.Hull City Council say that they are doing their best to deal with the matter respectfully.A spokeswoman said: “Although we can understand this request may be upsetting, we have responded to recent feedback relating to access to surrounding graves.We will take the utmost care to ensure that this matter is dealt with respectfully for all families.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000469194923.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"woman floors putin in judo sparring session forcing him to get real but you didnt see pics due to cover up","story":"After the  Olympic bronze medal winner Natalia Kuzyutina, , tackled the strongman, he got up and kissed her on the head.But so far images of the moment which left him on the sprawling mat from last night’s fight practice in Sochi have not been released, prompting the Ukrainian media to claim a cover-up by Russian “propaganda” teams.Ukrainian publication Obozrevatel claimed: “Russian propaganda did not show the unpleasant moment for Putin.”At the same session -

When the holiday is over and you leave the pool and sunshine to turn your attention once again to the news-vacuum that is Brexit, you may wonder which alternative dimension all the grown-ups were sucked into, and why more Ritalin was not prescribed to those currently smashing the country to pieces.Because with  working days until Brexit -  in Northern Ireland, where presumably the inhabitants will be spending the March bank holiday doomsday prepping - our political class is floundering as only those who have unwisely put bricks in their pockets and jumped in the deep end can do.Theyre not panicking. Theyre too stupid for that. Instead theyre merrily trying to drown each other in the mistaken belief that,they are the last one left, they will own a swimming pool. They have failed to note this ownership will last for all of a second before their vision darkens permanently, because they did not think it through before immersing themselves in something they were entirely unqualied to deal with. The Conservative Party is doing just as it has for the past  years, and expending all its energies negoatiating with a fringe so deranged even David Bowie in the depths of an LSD bender would dismiss it as ridiculous.The Labour Party still cant agree with itself on what day of the week it is. This is possibly because it is worried some of the days are Jewish, and possibly because some members accuse others of not believing strongly enough in St Jeremy of Islington.

The trip will come just days after influential Lords committee accused the Government of being “on the wrong side of international law” over arms sales during the Kingdom’s involvement in hostilities in Yemen. The report, published by the Lords International Relations Committee today, called on ministers to suspend key weapons contrats to members of the Saudi-led coalition in the conflict, and address the causes of the “unconscionable” humanitarian crisis in Yemen. And the Chancellors visit comes amid mounting questions over visits made to Saudi Arabia by senior UK officials, apparently in connection with arms sales, within days of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A Cabinet source told the Mirror: “Arent we supposed to be taking a tough line with these beheaders    The UK has licensed over pound. billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, and pound million worth to its coalition partners since the conflict in Yemen commenced in March . The UK is the second largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia after the US, accounting for % of arms imports to the oil-rich nation. Lord Howell, chair of the committee said: “It That the UK is the second-largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia, and the fth largest donor of humanitarian aid in Yemen is a contradiction which the government must address as a matter of urgency.” He added: “We do not agree with the Government’s assertion that it is narrowly on the right side of international humanitarian law in the case of licensing arms exports to the Saudi-led coalition. “It is narrowly on the wrong side: given the volume and type of arms being exported to the Saudi-led coalition, we believe they are highly likely to be the cause of signicant civilian casualties in Yemen, risking the violation of international humanitarian law.” Treasury officials refused to confirm Mr Hammond’s travel plans in advance of the visit.   And they would not say what the aim of any trip to Saudi Arabia would be. The Foreign Office did not respond to a request for comment. Mr Hammond last travelled to Saudi Arabia in July , when he visited Jeddah for discussions with King Salman on the Kingdoms Vision  plan for social and economic reforms. In , Mr Hammond was criticised by human rights groups, after he refused to condemn the mass execution of  people in Saudi Arabia. The Government had expressed disappointment at the executions. But asked to go further on the BBC, Mr Hammond refused to denounce the action.Instead he claimed: Let us be clear, first of all, that these people were convicted terrorists.” At least four of the men were arrested and sentenced to death for taking part in political protests. In Decemberthe Mirror revealed British officials promoting arms exports held meetings with Saudi Arabian government and military personnel in the weeks immediately after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.   A high-level delegation from the Defence and Security Organisation, which exists solely to promote arms exports, was in Riyadh on the day of the killing, October . And senior officials from the Department of International Trade , including Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner, and representatives from the Foreign Office held meetings with businessmen during a three-day trade conference in Riyadh, while the Government officially sought to distance itself from the event. The summit came at the peak of international uproar over Mr Khashoggis death and dismemberment, apparently at the hands of Saudi government agents in the country’s consulate in Istanbul. Mr Khashoggi, a journalist and dissident who criticised the kingdoms rulers, was murdered moments after he entered Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul on October . It is said that he was strangled before his body was dismembered and removed from the consulate. His remains have not been found. There has been speculation in Turkey that his body was dissolved in acid.   The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt both insisted at the time that the UK had withdrawn from the so-called ‘Davos in the Desert’ summit as questions mounted over Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the murder. Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said:“This is a welcome and credible report and will add further weight to the growing international pressure on the UK and others to end arms sales to the brutal Saudi regime. UK-made fighter jets and bombs have played a central role in the bombardment and the destruction. Despite the atrocities and abuses that have been committed, the Government’s position has been to push arms sales at all costs. These sales are immoral and illegal.The Saudi regime has shown a consistent contempt for human rights and has proven that it cannot be trusted to observe the most basic rights of Saudi people. YetDowning Street has trusted it to investigate itself for war crimes. How much worse does the situation have to get before Theresa May and her colleagues take action ”A Government spokesperson said: “We welcome the IRC’s report on Yemen and thank the committee for engaging on this fundamental issue. The UK is doing all that it can to help parties to find a way to end this devastating conflict.We are putting our full weight behind the work of Martin Grfiths and the UN-led peace process, and urge the international community to do the same. It is the only way to finding a lasting solution to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alesha macphail accused 16 sent","story":"NewsAlesha MacPhail suspect, , sent bad joke Snapchat selfie saying \"Found the guy whos done it\"The teenage boy denies raping and murdering Alesha, whose body was discovered in woodland on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, on July  last yearShareBySophie EvansLaura Paterson:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAlesha MacPhail was found dead in woodland on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, on July  last year \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA boy accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail sent a Snapchat video of himself to pals before saying: Found the guy whos done it, a court has heard.

As number two in America’s Drug Enforcement Administration, he had led the most successful operations in the agency’s history. The target of his obsessions were either dead or safely put away. But then in July , Riley’s nemesis, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, escaped. While being held in Mexico’s supposed maximum security Altiplano prison, the leader of the murderous Sinaloa Cartel – the world’s biggest drug-trafficking shyorganisation – fled through a mile-long tunnel built under his cell before riding away to freedom on a makesht motorbike. “I was going to retire until this d*** escaped,” Riley said.   Chapo had been his white whale, the object of an infatuation that sidelined shyeverything , including his family. “I love my we and kid, but I was never home for dinner,” said Riley. What followed was a very personal shyfour-year mission that this week ended with Chapo being put behind bars on US soil for le – and Riley finally retired. After a three-month trial in New York, jurors found the Mexican guilty on all  charges after six days of deliberation. They convicted the near legendary cartel boss of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds, international distribution of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs, and use of firearms.   He faces le in a “supermax” American jail in Florence, Colorado, known as the “Alcatraz of the Rockies” alongside Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, British shoe bomber Richard Reid and   conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. The verdict brought a welcome end to Riley’s decades-long hunt for America’s most wanted man, who once offered an pound, bounty to anyone who brought him the DEA agent’s decapitated head. It is a fact Riley, , admits not only scared him but also “p***ed” him off. In , Riley was handed a transcript of a conversation wiretapped by his staff. It eavesdropped on Chapo’s men negotiating a price to kill him. “I saw a transcript, and it basically said, ‘What do you think Chapo would give us to shut him up and cut his head off.’ “The joke is, they talked about only , , which p***ed me off.  “What bothers me the most is I did exactly what that d*** wanted me to do. I got scared, and I started looking over my shoulder. And that’s what he intended.” Riley is the son of a hospital shypathologist and a nurse, and grew up in Chicago. His first jobs with the DEA had him working undercover as a s yuppie making cocaine deals. But he soon realised he wanted bigger fish – those who ran the operations. As he worked his way up through the ranks, he became involved in combating the Colombia drug trade, helping bring down Pablo Escobar in Medelliacuten and catch the leaders of the Cali cartel. Then when during the early s Chapo announced himself to the world by executing dozens of rivals and decapitating several Mexican cops, Riley’s interested piqued. “The images were seared into my soul. I never forgot the brutality or the name,” Riley said. Plus Chapo showed a gt for logistics no other cartel could match. At one point, he was called “El Rapido” because of his ability to move drugs from Mexico into the States within  hours. “Guzman was the most business-savvy son of a bitch who ever ran a criminal shyorganisation,” Riley said. His obsession with Chapo helped him become the head of the El Paso DEA office covering nearly one-third of the US-Mexico border. Upon his arrival, Riley made known his sole intention was “to get El Chapo under control”. His display of defiance did not go shyunnoticed. A sign reading, “Welcome Jack Reilly [sic]” was hung off a bridge just across the border in Mexico.  Weeks later as he drove along a deserted road, Chapo sent his men to give a warning. Riley was pursued at speeds of up to mph before he got out of his car, gun drawn expecting a firefight. But his pursuers shyinexplicably then sped off. Their job, however, was done. “That whole thing was just to scare the s*** out of me,” Riley said. However it only served to further cement his resolve. “I got p***ed off and said, ‘It’s either him or me,’” said Riley. “I’m a stubborn old Irish cop from Chicago. I’d put my money on me.” Despite a move back to his hometown, Riley refused to let his hunt for Chapo die. He began building a case in the Windy City targeting local gangs who worked for the cartel boss to stop the streets flooding with heroin. Under one roof Riley brought together the DEA, FBI, state troopers and police to chase the “choke-point guys” – the brokers who were buying in bulk from Chapo before then selling it on to the gangs. It opened huge resources to him including shywiretapping local criminals’ phones. “What really stands out is how stupid all these guys were,” Riley said. “On one call, [a dealer] is talking to Chapo’s guys in Mexico, and he says he thinks the ‘three letters’ [DEA] are onto us. So the guy says, ‘Don’t call me at this number anymore.’ Then he gives out his new number. We laughed our ass off in the office.”  Operation Strike Force was a huge success. Arrests and seizures rose, local drug lords fell and the busts netted millions in cash forfeitures. In , Chicago named Chapo Public Enemy No – and the fallout from Riley’s move surprised everyone, him included. The Mexican government was bombarded with calls from enraged shybusiness leaders demanding the drug lord’s arrest. “They screamed that Chapo was disgracing their country,” Riley said. Authorities in Mexico immediately changed their approach, offering new levels of shycooperation. They pledged to hunt down Chapo in the hills and working hand in glove with the DEA they closed in on him. US intelligence began shymonitoring the phones of those around him, so Chapo ordered his henchmen to dispose of their burner phones regularly, but many got lazy and didn’t. The US also used drones to carry out surveillance of suspected hideouts, hoping to snap an image of Chapo. The method led to several close calls – in one raid, Chapo escaped through a tunnel hidden beneath his bathtub – and shyultimately his capture in . A year after Riley’s announcement, they chased him to Mazatlaacuten and arrested him, without resistance, in his hotel room. A few months after his capture, however, Chapo was gone through that mile-long tunnel from his Mexican prison cell.  Although only ft ins, the drug lord compensated for his short stature as a giant in the Mexican underworld. He paid a reported poundmillion in costs and bribes to officials to remove more than , tonnes of earth to escape. It all added to the myth of El Chapo. “One of the reasons he’s been successful is he’s used the media. There are folk songs written about him,” Riley said. “There is the Robin Hood theory that he builds soccer fields and water purication. I’ve never seen any evidence of that, but he tries to paint himself that way. The only thing I know is he’s a stone-faced killer.” Riley, by now second in command at the DEA, had flown down a few days earlier to noty Mexican officials that Chapo was planning to escape. The alarm went ignored.  Then in late , they got another break. Officials suspected Chapo was heading to Los Mochis, a coastal town in Sinaloa. Surveillance images showed building crews reinforcing the front door on one house, and locals were overheard saying, “Papi is coming.” In the end, “burritos and porn are what did him in,” Riley said. It was January , when Mexican shyofficials saw a van leaving from a safe house late at night. Inside the vehicle, one of the men looked like Chapo. “They were going out for burritos and porn – who  would need both at that hour ” said Riley. After watching him , the Mexican marines moved in. Chapo escaped through the sewer and emerged, carjacking a driver before finally being apprehended. He was extradited to the US in .Riley, who is now retired, is happy his nemesis is facing le behind bars afterhis conviction.He has no love or admiration for Chapo. “He was on top for  years, has billions of dollars hidden – and he’s a second-grade dropout who can barely read and write and has to dictate love letters in prison. Explain it to me, ’cause I don’t get it. How did this f***ing mope become El Chapo ” Riley said. But sadly such was his business acumen that the drug lord has left a deadly legacy. Riley said: “All those routes he opened, all that fentanyl he shipped – he’s gonna kill our kids for years to come. This monster he built, it’s too big to fail now, thanks to him.” Fling Penn in jail for cartel bosss escape The cop credited with capturing Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman says Hollywood star Sean Penn should be in prison for allowing the drug lord to escape arrest. As Jack Riley, his DEA team and elite Mexican marines were poised to arrest the fugitive kingpin in October  in a rugged mountain hideout in his birthplace of La Tuna, their mission had to be aborted when the Oscar-winning actor suddenly appeared.  Just as the order was about to be given to move in, Penn and Kate del Castillo, a Mexican soap opera actress who had praised Chapo online, bizarrely arrived at the compound. The pair had arranged to met Chapo in secret for a film about his le before the Dead Man Walking star then published a gushing interview with the cartel boss in Rolling Stone magazine. Fearing the civilians would be caught in the crossfire, commanders ordered the marines to stand down. It gave Chapo the chance to escape. Riley, who inspired Breaking Bad’s Hank Schrader, is furious Penn has not faced prosecution. “Oh, my God. If I could get my hands on Sean Penn,” Riley said. “The people he put at risk because of that stunt. He should be in jail.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man faces losing home home","story":"NewsMan faces losing his home after council mistakenly sells £k flat at half priceAntony Zomparelli, , says he was stunned when Islington Borough Council wrote to him admitting they had accidentally undercharged himShareCommentsByJack Longstaff:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-faces-losing-home-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA homeowner has been told to pay pound, or face losing his home - after the council wrongly sold him a pound, flat at half price. Dad Antony Zomparelli, , bought his two-bed flat from Islington Borough Council for pound, in . But he was stunned two years later when the council wrote to him admitting they had accidentally undercharged him - as they thought the home only had one bedroom. Security guard Antony, who has four children, could not afford to pay the dference - and now the council is taking him to court. The local authority wants to reclaim ownership of his flat or the money they claim he owes.   Single Antony, who lives in the second floor flat alone, says the unforgivable mistake has ruled his le ever since and is preparing for a court room fight later this year. He claims hed never have bought the houseit was on the market for pound, - and thinks the council have no right to DOUBLE the price over a sqm room. He said: I would never have bought the propertyI knew it was going to cost pound,. It would never have crossed my mind. How can they expect me to afford to pay. It has ruined my le. I cantas a normal person or think straight. It has caused me depression and Ive had to go to the doctors.   It has put a massive strain on my relationship with friends and family. Ive been in la la land since I got the first letter. I just couldnt believe it. I cant understand how they can do this, it seems impossible. Theyve clearly made a massive mistake and its of no fault of my own. Antony has lived in the flat, in Chadwell Street, Islington, since , and originally rented it from the council. He bought it from the authority under the Right To Buy scheme in , and because hed lived there for so long he got an pound, discount. The council priced it at pound, in August  and he got a pound, mortgage - for the remaining amount after the discount - in .  He was previously paying pound a week in rent but now pays around pound, a month in mortgage repayments. But two years later, in , Antony received a shocking letter from the council explaining the blunder, and demanding the remaining pound,. The council admitted it valued the home as a one-bed in a desktop valuation - a way of valuing a property or business using existing information. In legal documents, Antony - via solicitor Peter Felton of Feltons Law - alleges it was due to an error in the councils computerised records.  But Antony claims before the sale took place, an independent surveyor conducted a site survey of the flat. The bedroom in question is a box room and Antony claims it was mentioned on his lease, drawn up by the council. The council is claiming security guard, Antony, has been unjustly enriched by the apparent admin blunder. In a letter to Antony in March , the council explained where a public body acts outside their jurisdiction, their decision is void. The letter included the councils admission that it had no power to dispose of the premises at a lower valuation than that based on market value.  As a result, the council is entitled to recover the funds, by way of restitution for unjust enrichment, the letter said. Lawyers acting on behalf of the council tried to settle outside of court and offered Antony the option to agree terms for restoration of the balance of the purchase price. But the two parties failed to agree terms, and in a letter sent to Antony in October , he was issued an ultimatum - either accept liability to pay up, or enter a legal battle. Court papers prepared for proceedings say the council has a duty to recover the missing pound,, as they acted outside their statutory powers by granting the lease at an undervalue.  In a letter, sent in October , the council offered Antony a final  day window in which to settle the dispute outside of legal proceedings, and warned of lodging a claim against himhe still refused to pay. Both parties have prepared court papers but a start date for proceedings is yet to be confirmed. Worried Antony said: Up until  everything was completely fine. I first heard about all of this when the council sent me a pretty aggressive letter. It even said we understand this letter may cause you some distress. They told me by letter my property had been undervalued and we need to resolve the pound, I now owe them. Even my barrister has said he has no idea what the outcome will be.  I have no idea how they can justy asking for that much more money. It has always been a two-bed flat. It was never a one-bed. Its madness really. They have doubled the price of a property based on a box room. Antony says he is the victim of an admin error and is being punished for something out of his control. The council and Antony are due to begin legal proceedings at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court but are awaiting confirmation on a date. Antony has enlisted the help of solicitors for the upcoming legal battle and says he is adamant hell keep his home. Antonys defence barrister, Christopher Royal QC, claims there is no reported case of a former landlord claiming damages from the former tenant due to an undervaluation. But the homeowner fears evenhe wins in court, hell have to sell his flat to pay for the legal bill - which he fears could top pound,. He said: No matter what happens I will have to sell the property to pay my legal fees. If I win Ill get the fee back for my barrister but Ill have to pay some costs for my solicitor and mortgage company. I will probably be unable to live in London anymore. Ill be bankruptI lose. Antony says he took the decision to buy the flat for the benefit of his children and wanted to ensure he leaves a legacy for them in London. He said: I wasnt surprised at the price when I bought it. It was the first time Id ever bought a property so it seemed a lot of money to me. I wanted to get on the property ladder for my children and I was really happy.  I wanted to make my childrens lives easier for when they want a home. I thought it was odd how they valued it on a computer but I was ensured it was normal. The effect on me has been incredible. It has ruled my le for four year. I dont wish I never bought it in the first place. I got a lot of fulfilment from it. The most unjust part of it is I will still lose the property evenI win. I cant get my head around it, evenI win I know Ill still be losing.has contacted Islington Borough Council for comment.

Judge Timothy Stead condemned Sumners irresponsibility and disregard for safety. She was sentenced to three years for causing serious bodily harm by dangerous driving.

Niki Shaw, , was once a size  and was forced to wear a mens unorm at work as she was too large for the ladies sizes.“I only took the kids abroad for the first time in , the mum of three told the HullLive .I would never go before and it wasn’t because I couldn’t afford it - I just didn’t want to get shown up.” The west Hull mum said that was missing out on experiences with her family due to her weight. “We used to go on holiday to Scotland a lot with the kids and my husband would say ‘shall we go up this mountain ’   “I’d stay down the bottom with the dog and you miss out on things, she added. It was a health scare that kicked started Mrs Shaws incredible transformation, when she realised her size and thyroid issues could lead to other complications. Mrs Shaw revealed it was her husband who urged her to ask the doctor about sleep apnea during her thyroid check - a suggestion that she initially viewed as laughable. “I said ‘don’t be stupid, I’m .’ The doctor asked me five questions and she said answer and I will tell you at the end. I answered and she said she was going to have to send me for further tests. “I said you are not putting me in a mask at night at . I’ve got three kids and when you look at things like thyroid there is a greater chance of diabetes and cancer. This was the jolt that she needed to get into shape. Mrs Shaw said she knew that she needed to do this andshe was going to do it [she] had to grab the bull by the horns.”   After that Mrs Shaw joined WeightWatchers, determined to get into shape. The west Hull woman revealed that initially she struggled to shed the pounds, but it was her group’s coach, Jo Barr, that spurred her onto stop her from falling off the wagon. “Jo would text me and say ‘don’t give in.’ Some people lose nine pounds in the first week but that’s not realistic for everyone. For me in the first weeks it was only a pound and then it was half a pound when everyone  was losing a stone in a month. “I would be luckyI lost two and a half pounds but after a couple or months I had gone on holiday and I was still big but I lost one and a half stone. By tweaking her diet and hitting the gym, Mrs Shaws weightloss began to pick up speed. Now she spends six days per week in the gym and has changed her routine so she can get up earlier to keep healthy. “I used to come home from work andI sat down I would be asleep. Usually, I would come in, cook the kids’ dinner then fall asleep and wake up at pm. “I didn’t get a good night’s sleep and that caused a knock on effect. I would hit snooze until the very last moment I had to get up.  I used to get everything ready the night before so I could get out of bed at the very last minute but now I’m up in the mornings as early as .am because I’m at the gym and when I’m not I’m up at .am. The mum of three said that she eats three meals a day, changing her portion control to bring her diet into line. “I don’t snack anymore, You can - and I still can have crisps and chocolate but for me they are the things I used to turn to for comfort and I would eat them in secret, she added. Mrs Shaw did not say exactly how much she now weighs, but she did reveal that she has dropped from a size  to a size  since she started her weightloss journey. Now, she describes herself as more confident and has gained a supportive circle of friends. “I never would have worn a dress because I would never have really gone shopping, she said. “I no longer have to buy things that cover me - I can buy fitted dresses and I was never able to do that. “It has changed my le because I’m not stuck in all the time. I would have gone to work, come home, sorted the kids’ dinner out and gone to bed - that was my routine. “Now I can be selfish. The kids can make their own meals so they can look after themselves and I think it’s good to be selfish.

Fears had been raised by walkers over the sad pooch after they spotted him alone on Langland Bay in Swansea on Valentines Day. It was a scene that couldnt fail to melt even the hardest of hearts, especially when the lovelorn figure got up and strolled towards the rocks, trailing his balloon sadly behind him. Some passersby believed he may have been stood up by his Valentines date - others feared something more sinister may have happened to his owner, reports Wales Online .

Joann Randles, who was on the beach with her partner for a late-afternoon walk, took his photo as he wandered up and down the beach.   We started off in Caswell Bay and walked over to Langland, where there happened to be a dog with a balloon tied to its collar all on its own, she said. We didnt think anything of it, but he looked so sad, I took his picture. The couple continued to walk across the bay, and as they walked back, the dog was still there. Miss Randles added: There were other dogs on the beach with their owners, and he went over to seemingly try and play with them, but they all ran off. That was when we realised he didnt seem to have anyone with him, like an owner or anything.   It looked like a Disney movie, with a lonely prince trying to find his princess. The dog hung around on the beach until Miss Randle left just before pm. But for the rest of the evening, she couldnt help wonderinghe ever did find someone who loved him. It was cute at the time, but it played on my mind when I got home, said the -year-old. Where were his owners  He looked so forlorn with his droopy face, and it being Valentines Day, it seemed ironic. I cant help wonderinghe did ever find a date or a friend. Gordons owners confirmed he was perfectly happy - although a bit mfed off he had to wear a balloon.

With her mum working nights, Jessicas older sisters, Laura and Rebecca, who were only  and  at the time, would look after her so it was all Iceland oven and microwave food. She had a sweet tooth and would crave anything sweet which would see her drink two cans of regular coke, three cans of diet coke and a chocolate bar each evening.  But she equally used to hate the way she looked and while she would dream of going shopping in Topshop with her friends as Dorothy Perkins was the only shop catering for her size. Since starting to learn about health aged , Jessica has shed a staggering seven stone and now fits a size  . She hopes to inspire others with her transformation and prove that you dont need to join a slimming club, spend money on expensive meal plans or a personal trainer to lose weight.  I was uneducated on nutrition and healthy eating and I was inactive as a child due to being overweight. At school I never did a lesson of PE because the thought of getting changed in a public place was horric - never mind actually getting on a trampoline. I used to get into a lot of trouble in secondary school with fights and being disruptive because I didnt have any confidence within myself and this was how I got accepted - only now I can look back and realise thats how I felt although on the surface I wouldnt have seemed bothered about my weight at all.  But it wasnt until after her sister, Rebecca, was diagnosed with gestational diabetes whilst she was pregnant in , at st lb and a UK size  to , that Jessica - who had a BMI of  - decided to actually do something. Through my work I started to see the risks around obesity and awareness around eating healthy. I saw a picture of myself and the mayor of Lewisham that was taken in front of a theatre full of people when I completed my level three apprenticeship. When I saw it, I thought is that what I really look like, I couldnt look at the picture because it made me feel so insecure and embarrassed. Jessica joined a spin class in March  and eventually plucked up the courage to join her local gym where she started going twice a week.  She educated herself on nutrition and started to prepare healthy meals for herself at the start of each week. Now, Jessica is a super svelte size eight to  and st lb and feels more confident than she ever has before. Before her weight loss Jessica would skip breakfast altogether, have a lunch of McDonalds, KFC, a meal deal from Tesco or a sandwich from Subway. Her dinner would consist of large portions of pre-prepared meals such as sausages, chips and bread or pizza. In between meals, Jessica would snack on anything sweet like biscuits, cakes or chocolate. Now Jessica always makes time for breakfast which is rice cakes and fruit when she is on the go or poached eggs on brown toastshes at home. For lunch she has chicken, rice and steamed vegetables or a homemade hotpot or salad.  For dinner she has something similar or an oven baked salmon fillet.Since her transformation, Jessica likes to keep herself busy whereas before she was happy to sit in front of the telly in the evening. She has also shared her weight loss journey to her Instagram profile.Losing weight has made me much more aware of my health and how important it is to look after your body. Health is wealth, she said. I have a lot more energy I find myself wanting to keep active and busy whereas before I was content with a pizza, bottle of coke and the TV.  I feel much more confident, it has allowed me to think hard work does pay off and you can really achieve anythingyou put your mind to it. I want to inspire others with my story. I never thought it was possible to achieve weight loss without signing up to a slimming club, buying meal replacements or a personal trainer. People dont always recognise Jessica when shes out and about because she looks so dferent from how she did before, but she says her friends and family have supported her throughout her lestyle change. A lot of people dont recognise me, I have had to give people my full name before they realise who it is. My close friends and family are proud, they have supported and embraced my new-found love for fitness and even my step-dad has lost just over two stone recently, she said. Surround yourself with those who inspire you.

James Defalco was sentenced to  months after breaching court orders which meant he must tell any woman he meets that he is HIV positive. The order was first made in  when he infected an -year-old woman with the virus after having sex with her. Since then Defalco has breached the Sexual Offences Prevention Orderand Sexual Harm Prevention Orderon ious occasions. Those orders banned him for engaging in sex with anyonehe had not told them he was HIV positive, and associating with children under  in a public or private place. Yesterday Judge Paul Cook jailed him for a total of  months. Defalco met his latest victim after setting up a profile on the dating website Plenty of Fish. He told his victim she looked lovely and he met the woman and visited her and her family on four occasions.   Judge Paul Cook said: You engaged in sexual activity with her which involved intimate kissing. The sexual activity was intimate but it fell short of penile penetration. The judge said he also played with her two-year-old great granddaughter, bouncing her up and down on his knees and playing with her toys. He said he infected the -year-old woman with HIV when he was  and in  he had a sexual relationship with a -year-old woman. Prosecutor Mary McCarthy said Defalco has a long history of offending including violence, dishonesty and sexual offences. In  he breached the orders four times when he undertook work for an elderly lady. In  after he was freed from jail he associated with a vulnerable female family member. In  he breached it by going to Guernsey with a woman with whom he had unprotected sex. And again in  he befriended a woman who had children. Exeter Crown Court said his police offender manager investigated last September that Defalco had begun a relationship with a -year-old woman in Brixham, Devon.   Miss McCarthy said: It quickly developed into a relationship but not a sexual one. They were close quite quickly and there was kissing and sexual touching. She had not been informed he was HIV positive. Defalco was arrested but told police he had informed the woman of his HIV status. And he said their relationship was a friendly one where he pecked her on the cheek - and denied it was a sexual relationship. Kevin Hopper, defending, said: There is a theme here of the same old offences committed time and time again. The terms of the order have been made crystal clear to him. He said Defalco, of Brixham, Devon, claims the chances of passing on his viral infection are zero. Mr Hopper said: He does not consider himself a sex offender.

McCarthy now faces jail after admitting three offences of GBH related to procedures carried out at Dr Evils Body Modication Emporium in Wolverhampton. But Mr Art, formally known as Mathew Whelan, refused to give a statement to West Midlands Police against McArthy and has warned that making him a criminal will drive the body modication scene underground. Speaking to the Mirror, he said: Brendan is being treated very very unfairly, like a sort of test case.  People have been on TV doing extreme operations, branding, cutting - but now apparently it is illegal. A conviction like this will drive body modders underground, a lot of people dont even want to share stories about it. They wont talk about it but it will still happen because this community exists.

He told the Mirror that the tattooist, who was first arrested in , talked him out of a body modication procedure. He said:said he wouldnt cut my toe off, that it would have ruined my balance. I knew which toe I wanted but he said that wouldnt have been good. I thought about it, I researched it and I realised it wasnt for me.   He also questioned the actions of the police to arrest McCarthy. Why didnt the council or the police tell him to stop practising while they looked into it, rather than making him a criminal  Ive not had a crime committed against me, I challenged themapproaching me and put in a complaint against , that was rejected. I contacted victims of crime because Im legally deemed a victim of crime, theyve got a helpline.  I wanted to see how they could help me get the law reformed but they kept passing me round in circles. But the -year-old has planned on applying for victims of crime compensation.

Brandon Dinetz took five months planning the proposal for fellow lawyer Jen Lettman and it looked like his effort was worth it. The -year-old set up an imaginary drink driving trial in the Palm Beach County Courthouse in the US and told Jen it was important that she saw his opening statement. The romantic man even roped in a judge, a defence attorney, a fictional defendant and  of Jens family and friends to act as the fake jury. Unsuspecting Jen, also , began to cry when Brandon addressed the room with a specially tailored statement declaring his love for her.   Speaking after saying yes, Jen said: He and I had always talked about getting married and we knew we were going to be together but I didn’t think we would get married any time soon. When we worked together we would regularly watch each other’s opening statements and critique each other, so it wasnt unusual for me to be in the courtroom with him. I didn’t know the facts about the DUI trial he made up, and I didn’t really ask. I wasn’t really paying attention until I recognised that one of the jurors looked like Brandon’s dad, which I thought was funny.  Then I saw my dad and I was so confused. When I saw my sister I knew what was happening and I started crying. Of course I said Yes. Brandon added: The judge came out and as usual she askedthe state and the defence were ready to proceed and we said Yes we are. Then she said, ‘Bring in the jury’.   All of our friends and family started to come in and I think when Jen saw her sister and my dad she immediately knew. My back was to her but I could hear her start to cry. When she said yes there was a huge cheer from the jury. The judge said, Mr Dinetz you have been sentenced to le. Everyone laughed. Brandon proposed to Jen with a personally designed ring, embedded with a diamond from her grandmother’s engagement ring.

But whether or not you want to have children is a decision that is totally and completely up to you, your partner and no one . However one mum clearly didnt get this memo, as she decided to take matters into her own hands when her son and his we told her they didnt want to have a baby.  The womans daughter-in-law revealed the shocking story in a post on Reddit, which has since been removed. She began by explaining that she and her husband are in their late s and had made a deliberate decision not to have children.Some people had labelled them selfish for choosing this, but the worst response came from the husbands mother who apparently went into hysterics and began raving about how the bloodline and family name will die. The couple remained true to their decision despite this and hoped she would come around eventually, but she never did - and now shes gone and done something despicable.   After offering to cook dinner for the couple one night, the mother-in-law sent her son out to the shops to buy some ingredients. His we explains how she ed home from work, to find her husband still out of the house. So she went upstairs to change, but what she saw upon entering her bedroom has turned her world upside down.Her mother-in-law was poking holes in the couples condoms.  She wrote: When I opened the door into our bedroom what I see is what looks like MIL carefully trying to poke holes into our condoms. She snaps her head in my direction with this mortying deer in the headlights look on her face. Like a fish out of water. She mumbles something about how shes trying to save the family and frantically runs out of the house before I even have a chance to say anything. When her husband eventually came home, she recounted the events to him and says he was absolutely horried by his mothers actions.  To make matters worse, they soon realised that she had been in the home a few weeks earlier and could have tampered with their contraception then as well. Reddit users were equally as horried to hear her story, with one person telling them to go to the police and press charges against the mum. Others said they should end all contact with her and described the behaviour as assault. Many advised that the couple chuck out all of their condoms immediately and take a pregnancy test, just in case the mother-in-law had been doing this for a while. Sadly it seemed she had done it before and after taking a test and visiting the doctor, the woman updated her post to reveal that she was in fact pregnant with her first child and is unsure of what to do next.Im so distraught that I havent been able to sleep in the last four days, she admitted. Im sorry I didnt update sooner but Ive been in a really dark place. At this point we havent even spoke or contacted MIL. Shes been blowing up our phones for the last three days, but we havent responded. Im just so lost as to what to do. I mean I never wanted to have kids sure, but at the same time having an abortion feels so wrong to me. She added: I cant believe Im in this situation right now. I dont know what Im going to do.

The animals refused to leave the one-year-old who was still alive and unable to get out of the deep pit. The tragic accident took place as the herd walked close to the village of Mahipani in north-western India on Wednesday night. In the dark, the animal slipped into the hole and the herd refused to give up on the baby and remained at the spot.   Concerned locals tried to drive them away over fears they would enter the village and used torches and firecrackers to try and get them to leave. One of the elephants threatened to run towards the mob while they started throwing stones at it. After a number of hours the herd finally gave up and walked back into the forest. The forest department arrived at the spot as soon as they received the information and tried to rescue the creature in distress.   But they could only recover the dead elephant calf from the pit the next morning. The villagers, out of sympathy observed last rites to the dead aninal. Forestry officials inspected the area to check for any more pits or gaps left open by the railway department to avoid further accidents.

He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children. He said: “We want to cater for as many dferent people as we can.” The decision will be made at a later meeting following a visit to the venue.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGardens and flowersAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year.

Now the Scottish Government are poised to step in and wipe out poundm of the debt mountain. A report presented at a board meeting this week said the “Scottish Government are currently planning on poundmillion of brokerage”. The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March.

Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half. The figure dipped from pound.m in   to pound.m in  . The risk for “financial performance” overall has been branded as “high” in the report.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated.

This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

have key tourist attractions such as distilleries and three fantastic -hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-back-their-right-to-scrap-free-school-music-tuition","story":"Local authority umbrella body Cosla agreed new guidance which says elected councillors should continue to have the power to introduce or increase charges.The move comes despite a nationwide campaign to oppose spiralling fees for instrumental music tuition in Scottish schools involving leading musicians, composers and educators.The move also flies in the face of a report issued last month by the Scottish Parliamentrsquos education committee which recommended that music tuition should be free in schools.Cosla had been urged to defend free tuition - or at the very least ensure fee increases were capped to rises in inflation.However, while the new guidance acknowledges concerns over the impact of charging, it states: ldquoThe financial situation facing local authorities means many take the view that without some level of charging the sustainability of instrumental music tuition is at risk.ldquoThe provision of instrumental music tuition, and the policies adopted in terms of charging, concessions and other aspects of the service, is a matter for local democratically elected representatives who have to balance a range of priorities.The document concludes: ldquoThis guidance does not change the position that decisions about charging are a matter for local discretion including the decision to charge, the level of any charge or to apply concessions beyond those outlined in this paper.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union, which has campaigned on the issue, said the document paved the way for the continuation of ldquounacceptable practices.He said: ldquoWe believe instrumental music is a key part of the curriculum within our comprehensive education system and should not be treated as an add-on, as it is throughout this document.ldquoThe guidance outlines very limited and short-term approaches to limiting fees or exempting certain categories of students, rather than acknowledging the need for sufficient investment to guarantee free access to instrumental music for all young people.ldquoThere is growing evidence that the introduction of charges is having a serious impact on levels of uptake, with young people from less affluent backgrounds being most likely to miss out on the opportunity to learn music.Mr Flanagan, who has written to Cosla to express his concerns, called for local authorities to show ldquocollective leadership to defend key services rather than overseeing ldquodeath by a thousand cuts.Music instructor Alastair Orr, who took part in the Holyrood inquiry,also hit out at the guidance.He said: \"Coslas guidance to local authorities continues to show their indference to the plight of pupils and their parents who face paying exorbitant and unaffordable levels of fees to access instrumental and vocal tuition in Scotlands schools.\"Education Secretary John Swinney must challenge this monolithic thinking and encourage Cosla to acknowledge that this situation must end.\"However, Stephen McCabe, Coslarsquos children spokesman, defended the new guidance and said it would ensure greater consistency in support for poorer pupils.He said: ldquoAll local authorities are having to make very dficult budgetary choices on a wide range of services including instrumental music tuition.ldquoCharging for services is an important part of that decision making which can ensure that a service is sustainable. Nevertheless, no local authority makes the decision to introduce or increase charges for any service lightly, but with another extremely challenging budget it is an option that councils have to consider.ldquoThe guidance also points to good practice and consideration of the impact and potential unintended consequences of charging policies and reflects our decision there should be no charges for pupils eligible for free school meals or those sitting Scottish Qualications Authority exams.The guidance has been backed by Scotlands  local authorities and will now be discussed further with the sector and the Scottish Government.There was also support for the guidance from John Wallace, chairman of the Music Education Partnership Group, whichhas been discussing it with councils.He said: \"It expands on concessions and gives examples of solutions to problems and pitfalls to avoid.\"In my meetings with council leaders and directors of education across the country I have been impressed at their passion for maintaining their music services despite multiple financial constraints and the introduction of charging in many authorities to maintain services.\"The per capita public spend on instrumental music education in Scotland through local authorities is many times as great as in England and we aim to keep it that way.\"Evidence shows rising fees have led to greater numbers of pupils dropping out of music classes.More than one-third of councils put their fees up or introduced new fees last year with the highest more than pound.Experts warn it could lead to widening of the gap between the rich and poor, with only the wealthy able to develop their talents."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-suggests-government-officials-hiding-behind-hr-overhaul","story":"A spokesman for the former First Minister said top official Leslie Evans and others seemed to be ldquotrying to sub-contract their own responsibility onto their personnel department.The spokesperson said: ldquoThey should not be allowed to get away with it.

Your correspondent Peter A Russellpoints us in the right direction ndash ldquorational and pragmatic discussion for the best possible outcomes in the governance of the country, although I struggle to agree with him that this was reflected in the early days of the Scottish Parliament under Labour dominance. It should be possible for Westminster and Holyrood to agree a legal framework for the setting in motion of future legitimate referendums. The most logical way to agree on the granting of a new referendum is a formula based on seats held in Holyrood or Westminster or both with a specic time lapse between referendums.Theresa May previously said ldquonow is not the time for another Scottish independence referendum. It is a disgraceful dismissal by one person on a critical issue, the granting of which does not bring independence but simply a vote on it. If there is continued refusal to agree a framework for Scotlandrsquos way forward, an existing sense of frustration in the way Westminster is treating Scotland can only deepen, and who knows where that will lead Alan M Morris, Kirkhouse Road, Blanefield, Glasgow.THE normally-astute Iain Macwhirter misconceives the nature of the Union, and exaggerates the Supreme Courtrsquos pronouncements on Holyrood .The point of a constitution is to limit the day-to-day power of government. A sovereign Westminster means the UK has none. Any constitution which enshrined the inisibility of the UK would have rendered unlawful both the Good Friday Agreementand the Edinburgh Agreement .Spain is irrelevant. It does have aconstitution which, according to Madrid, prohibits Catalonian secession. That might be tested in the current notorious criminal trial, and subsequently perhaps in the European Court of Justice, where I hope Madrid will fail, because the constitution itself is woolly, and because Catalonia is a fit polity for independenceits people so choose.We should not fixate on a referendum under the Scotland Act. Section  is simply a procedure for the Privy Council to give Holyrood a power which it does not normally have: a mechanism, which thereby s within the terms of UK domestic law, for ascertaining the will of the Scottish electorate.In constitutional terms, however, the mechanism is not important. What is important, for a decision on independence to gain international recognition, is that it be legitimate, democratic and peaceful.If S was the only method by which Scotland could make the choice, that would have the necessary but absurd consequence that evenevery single resident from Unst to the Mull of Galloway wanted independence, London could prevent it by autocratic diktat. That would be absurd self-evidently, and because no UK government maintains that the Union persists by anything but consent.If Scotland withdraws that consent by a legal, democratic and peaceful decision, by whatever means, its exit from the Union cannot be legitimately frustrated. No absurd legal restrictions set up within the Union can operate to prevent such a Scottish exit, because the move to independence is of a higher order.A referendum under Section  should be tried again, not because of any inherent advantage, but because that was how Scotland rejected independence in , and reversing that decision should ideally use the same process.But Londonrsquos refusal would open the way for other acceptable means, such as an election under a clear and direct manesto of independence, on which London would have no say whatsoever.Accordingly, when the Scottish Government seeks permission for a fresh referendum, it should state thatpermission is not forthcoming within a certain time, the alternative route of an election will be taken. That would be unimpeachable, and the warning itself might be enough to wring agreement from London.It is a waste of breath to blame Scotlandrsquos non-independence on anyone but ourselves. The means are in our own hands entirely. All we have to do to show we are worthy of independence is to choose it.Alan Crocket, Leyland Road, Motherwell.THE  Scottish independence referendum campaign woke up, and lit up, Scotland. There was a flowering of political debate theand breadth of the country as people got involved in the campaign, many of whom had never before taken part in political campaigning, and there were vibrant public meetings held all over Scotland with town halls and community centres filled to overflowing. I do not recognise Peter A Russells description of the referendum campaign as being \"that bruising and isive episode\" I voted Yes, I have friends who voted No, and were still friends.Politics is isive, but presenting a distorted version of the events of the  campaign, which despite a few incidents on both sides, was overwhelmingly well conducted, is not only misleading, but insulting to the Scottish public, and smacks of the increasing desperation of many Unionists who know they are losing the argument.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.ROBERT IG Scottraised the important issue of the lack of respect shown to the questioner by the SNP at First Ministers Questions. It seems to be policy to attack and deride the question and the questioner. Presumably this is a deliberate approach to avoid actually answering the question asked.If I was in opposition I would simply announce at the start of Question Time that I would not be asking any questions as, based on past experience, there is little or no prospect of an answer being given.

Eventually,  tonnes of ironwork will pass through its gates bound for one of the top  ldquoInstagrammed places in the world.Itrsquos a major coup for the Scottish foundry and its  staff: the towerrsquos original ironwork was produced much closer to its home, at a foundry in Birmingham.At the same time, Ballantine Castings is making thousands of iron roof tiles for the Palace of Westminster. So far, itrsquos sent , south ndash a fraction of the ldquosignicant amount Ballantine says the job will require.Along with earlier work on Westminster Bridgendash so tricky that no other foundry in the UK even bothered to quote for the job ndash it adds up to a signicant Westminster hat-trick for a family concern that can trace its roots to .One of about  foundries that existed in the Falkirk area, it powered through the Industrial Revolution and survived the age of plastic, only to be knocked off its iron pedestal by the banking crisis.Stung by losses and despairing at the need to lay off staff ndash some with skills that are almost impossible to replace ndash the  buyout secured its future.Running of the foundry passed from fatherIan to son Gavin.An English literature graduate,his father had tried to steer him away, fearing he may end up at the helm of a fading giant.However, the call of the furnace, the need to keep a slice of industrial heritage alive and pride in knowing Ballantinersquos incredibly ornate ironworkndash even manhole covers are metallic works of art - was in the blood.ldquoYou should see my fatherrsquos house, itrsquos covered in iron, says Mr Ballantine. ldquoHersquod have a cast iron couchhe could.As he speaks, the furnace delivers another tub of liquid iron into the forkltrsquos waiting tub.Magnesium has made it dazzlingly bright too intense to look at for long, yet itrsquos hypnotically beautul.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupSaturday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Not just in the services they provide, but, as one of the biggest employers in Highland, council jobs are fundamental to the sustainability of many communities. So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future. We need to embed effective performance management and effective scrutiny.ldquoThe Corporate Plan will be coming to council in March and this will focus on scrutiny and driving performance.

But after holding the first AGM last week, the group now wants to go after larger projects through the lottery funding.The ultimate ambition is to renovate Dingwall Town Hall and ensure it is brought into regular and sustained use by locals and visitors as a focal point of the town.Before that, the DCDC directors and trustees, comprising Janet Bowen, Debbie Downie, Robin Lingard and Nigel Greenwood have been ldquosting through the communityrsquos suggestions for improvements to the town.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoDingwall is very fortunate to have a number of organisations which are dedicated to making the town an attractive and welcoming place. But we want to use our charitable status to unlock funding for capital projects which should make a signicant dference in raising Dingwallrsquos profile.The first of those projects out of the traps has been developed with the help of the Dingwall History Society and is a heritage trail around the town which stops off at around a dozen sites.Among them are the memorial next to the train station, the birthplace of MacBeth ndash Dingwall Castle, as well as the Macdonald Monument and others.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoUsing a series of display  to highlight to both local people and visitors the richness of Dingwallrsquos history, especially as a Viking settlement.A sticking point however is that the bridge over the Dingwall canal is closed due to safety concerns.ldquoThe big issue here, of course, is the future of the footbridge across the Dingwall canal, which has been out of use for some time now because of safety fears. The community council is very anxious to bring it back into use and we are looking at what role we might play in helping to bring it back into use.Many local groups feel that Dingwallrsquos Viking heritage has been a little neglected but in  archaeologists and historians managed to flesh out the legends.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

If this goes ahead, then the transition period would run from March  when we officially leave the EU up until December  .During this period, the UK would trade with the EU in the same way we do now while the two parties agree a new and permanent relationship. It would help businesses, iniduals and the government to prepare for new arrangements and minimise the disruption from any changes. If the withdrawal is rejected, then this is what is being called a no deal Brexit, and there will be no transition period.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

should not be a barrier to restoring powersharing in Northern Ireland, the DUP leader has said..pushArlene Foster said devolved government could be restored despite the ongoing uncertainty around the UK’s departure from the European Union.Mrs Foster called on Sinn Fein to get “serious” about restoring the institutions as she arrived for roundtable talks with the four other Stormont parties and the UK and Irish governments.The latest bid to resurrect the administration comes two years after the last Democratic Unionist Sinn Fein-led coalition imploded amid a row over a botched green energy scheme.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A no entry sign outside Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast The wrangle over the renewable heat incentivewas soon overtaken by disputes over the Irish language, the region’s ban on same sex marriage and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A number of attempts to find a negotiated deal to restore the institutions have ended in failure.Many believe the prospects of an imminentto powersharing are bleak, with the crisis seemingly in drt as political attention focuses on Brexit.Mrs Foster said that did not need to be the case.“I don’t think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern Ireland,” she said.There is no indication that the DUP or the British government are serious about resolving the outstanding issues and removing the obstacles to power-sharingConor Murphy, Sinn FeinFacebookTwitter“I wish that we had had a government up and running since March , that’s when we should have been back into government, instead, because Sinn Fein has refused to go back in, we have to deal with that.”The DUP leader expressed hope that there would be a Brexit deal before March .“We want to see a deal in relation to Brexit because we believe a deal that works for the whole United Kingdom and one that deals for the European Union is good for everybody,” she said.With the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo land for two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A locked gate outside Stormont Those civil servants are seriously hamstrung, with ongoing uncertainty over what decisions they are able to make in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance with many major policy initiatives in cold storage.“We need devolution back in Northern Ireland,” said Mrs Foster as she arrived at Stormont House for the meeting.“It should have been back in after March , after that election.“It didn’t and it’s a source of great frustration at this point, not just for us but for the whole population of Northern Ireland, that we are still talking about talks rather than actually dealing with government issues.”Mrs Foster repeated her claim that Sinn Fein was holding the process to “ransom”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster said Brexit should not distract from restoring powersharing at Stormont She reiterated that her party would go back into devolved government immediately, insisting the outstanding political disputes could be resolved in parallel.Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein branded the engagement a “sham”.On Thursday evening, Sinn Fein negotiator Conor Murphy said: “There is no indication that the DUP or the British government are serious about resolving the outstanding issues and removing the obstacles to power-sharing.“This is not a serious or credible attempt to restore the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.”On Friday, Mrs Foster criticised Mr Murphy’s remarks.“That’s very disappointing to hear Sinn Fein put out their stall like that,” she said.“I think most people in Northern Ireland want to see us getting back in to deal with all the issues that affect them in their everyday lives, instead of dealing with very narrow sectional issues.“Sinn Fein have held Northern Ireland to ransom these past two years, I deeply regret that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit varadkar says free movement for northern ireland citizens to continue","story":" Hi

We want more than that.“There is no appetite to go around on a merry-go-round again in a circular conversation that winds up with the DUP either unable to deliver an accommodation or unwilling to deliver solutions to what are very legitimate asks, made in the spirit of equality and the spirit of powersharing.”The republican leader continued: “We are open to any credible proposition but we will not participate in anything that amounts to a sham.“People two years on deserve so much more than that, so much better.”I dont think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern IrelandArlene FosterFacebookTwitterWith the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo land for two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.Those civil servants are seriously hamstrung, with ongoing uncertainty over what decisions they are able to make in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance with many major policy initiatives in cold storage.Mrs Foster called on Sinn Fein to get “serious” about restoring the institutions.“We need devolution back in Northern Ireland,” she said as she arrived for the talks with party MEP Diane Dodds.“It should have been back in after March , after that election.“It didn’t and it’s a source of great frustration at this point, not just for us but for the whole population of Northern Ireland, that we are still talking about talks rather than actually dealing with government issues.”Mrs Foster reiterated that her party would go back into devolved government immediately, insisting the outstanding political disputes could be resolved in parallel.Many believe the prospects of an imminentto powersharing are bleak, with the crisis seemingly in drt as political attention focuses on Brexit.Mrs Foster said that did not need to be the case, insisting the Brexit process should not be a barrier to restoring powersharing.“I don’t think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern Ireland,” she said.“I wish that we had had a government up and running since March , that’s when we should have been back into government, instead, because Sinn Fein has refused to go back in, we have to deal with that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The UK is leaving the European Union The DUP leader expressed hope that there would be a Brexit deal before March .“We want to see a deal in relation to Brexit because we believe a deal that works for the whole United Kingdom and one that deals for the European Union is good for everybody,” she said.On Brexit, Mrs McDonald said: “Brexit sets the scene and the tone for everything that happens now in Irish politics.“Here in the North people voted to remain, as Arleneis well aware, she defies that democratic decision, she advocates what, in our view, is a very, very reckless position in respect of Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"staff morale undermined over nounion recognition","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If I ever do go back, it’ll be a long time before the cameras stop and all the questions stop.”The head of MI had earlier warned that Britons ing from Islamic State are likely to have acquired “potentially very dangerous” skills and connections.Alex Younger, who did not comment specically on the case of Ms Begum, said UK nationals have a “right” to come home but that public safety was the first priority.Meanwhile, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he “will not hesitate” to prevent theof Britons who travelled to join IS.The head of Counter Terrorism Policing, Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said: “Anyone who s from Syria or other conflict zones, having gone in support of any proscribed terrorist group – whether that’s fighting for or against Daesh – or for any other illegal purposes, can expect to be investigated by the police.“Any investigation is carried out with an open mind and based on the evidence available. This is to determineiniduals have committed any terrorist or other criminal offences, regardless their motivation, and to ensure that they do not pose a danger to the public or the UK’s national security.“There can be no hope of repatriation without these investigations taking place, and anyone who doesto the UK from conflict zones can, at best, expect to live under stringent limitations set out in the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Assistant Commissioner of the politan Police, Neil Basu, said society must stop people being radicalised “We as a society must learn that we can stop this from happening in the first place by trusting our Prevent strategy, reporting our concerns early and stopping people being radicalised, investigated and, most likely, criminalised by the poisonous rhetoric spewed by terrorist organisations of any ideology.”Mr Javid said those who left the UK to join IS were “full of hate for our country”, while security minister Ben Wallace warned that runaways who now want to come back must realise that “actions have consequences”.Anthony Loyd, The Times correspondent who found Ms Begum, said she was a “-year-old schoolgirl who made a terrible mistake… and we must do our best to rehabilitate her amongst our own people”.But her plea has been strongly rejected by others – including the brother of Alan Henning, the British aid worker beheaded by Mohammed Emwazi, who said she should “absolutely not” be allowed back.Any hopes of a rescue mission by British officials were also swtly quashed on Thursday as the Government ruled out an effort inside Syria to assist Ms Begum.While refusing to comment on inidual cases, Mr Wallace told the BBC: “I’m not putting at risk British people’s lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state.“There’s consular services where in the region and the strong message this Government has given for many years is that actions have consequences.”While no official operation to remove Ms Begum from Syria will be carried out, questions have been raised over whether Britain would be able to prevent Ms Begum’s eventualto the UK.Former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile told the BBC thatMs Begum has not gained a second citizenship of another country, she will have to be allowed back to her homeland because under international law it is not possible for a person to be made “stateless”.Meanwhile, Richard Barrett, a former director of global counter-terrorism at MI, suggested it would be “unreasonable” to expect the Syrian Defence Force to look after her indefinitely.He also warned that summary execution is the “most likely outcome” for such captured foreign nationals who are handed over to Syrian or Iraqi authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"cheery baby polar bear receives first examination at berlin zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last year, the US government sent more than  million dollars in aid to Cucuta to help Colombian authorities absorb some of the estimated three million Venezuelans fleeing hyper-inflation and food shortages.In slapping new sanctions on Major General Manuel Quevedo, president of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the oil executive had been instrumental in propping up what he called Mr Maduro’s illegitimate regime.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anti-Maduro protests in Caracas In the AP interview Mr Maduro said Maj Gen Quevedo had been in India this week looking to drum up new business for PDVSA after the company was hit with sanctions aimed at cutting off an estimated  billion dollars in profits.The new sanctions also target four high-ranking intelligence officials, including the head of the feared SEBIN intelligence police and an elite commando unit known as FAES which is accused of several targeted killings.In a statement, Mr Mnuchin accused the officials of corruption and helping Mr Maduro repress democracy in Venezuela — which includes “torture and other brutal use of force”.“We are intent on going after those facilitating Maduro’s corruption and predation,” Mr Mnuchin said, adding that Maj Gen Quevedo and others have syphoned off funds that “rightfully belong to the people of Venezuela”.The US sanctions block access to any property the iniduals own in the United States and bans US citizens from doing business with them.As US pressure mounted, secretary of state Mike Pompeo told reporters he sees clear signs that Mr Maduro is starting to understand Venezuelans reject him as their leader.In the AP interview, Mr Maduro said he was willing to meet President Donald Trump at any time or place to resolve the crisis over US recognition of Mr Guaido.Mr Pompeo said Mr Maduro’s request was not new, but it reflected that he is realising his crisis-riddled nation rejects his “model of governance”."},{"url":null,"title":"british government committed negotiating derry city deal","story":"The British government has reaffirmed its “commitment to negotiating” a City Deal for Derry this week but has not yet confirmed that it will be included in the next Budget.In a statement to the Derry News, Local Growth Minister at the Department for Communities and Local Government, Jake Berry MP, said: “We remain committed to negotiating a Derry Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and recognise its importance to the local area.“In January, Derry and Strabane Council have submitted a set of proposals to Government, which we are now reviewing and on which we will work proactively with local partners to develop.”Yesterday, Sinn Féin Foyle MP Elisha McCallion said she recently met with the British government’s Secretary of State for NI, Karen Bradley, at Westminster to discuss a range of issues including a city deal for Derry and the north west.\"At the meeting she indicated that progress is being made and they are keen to avoid any undue delays.\"She also said her officials were continuing discussions with the civil service in the north to advance a city deal for Derry.\"I will continue to engage with Karen Bradley and all stakeholders to ensure we secure a city deal for Derry as part of the inclusive growth deal for the city and the wider north west.\"In July of last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, attended a meeting at the Magee Campus in Derry where he said Northern Ireland has been leading the way within the UK in productivity growth and he wanted to “support this progress by inviting a bid for a Derry City Deal”.However, there has been little by way of an update since.  Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, James Brokenshire, appeared in Derry last August when he made no concrete commitment that it would be delivered, saying it would require a “detailed submission” of proposals and “further dialogue”.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshA successful bid could see a signicant sum of money injected into the local economy.A previous recipient of a city deal which would be comparable to that of Derry and the North West is the Inverness and Highland City Region in Scotland which received a commitment of £m in public funds, from the UK government, local council and regional partners – which will be invested over -

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads. However, we will continue to battle to secure government funding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Assumption pupils take part in mock European Union debate  ","story":"THREE Assumption Grammar pupils ditched their books for a day when they took part in a mock European Union debate last Thursday.A-Level politics students Niamh Mateer, from Maghera, Ciara Rooney, from Newcastle, and Ellen-Louise Cleary, from Darragh Cross, represented the UK in the debate.They were joined by other young people from across the province who represented countries in the European Union.Run by British Council Northern Ireland, the mock debate showed the girls how the EUrsquos decision making process works.Given the volatile political climate in relation to Brexit, representing the UK was a dficult position for the girls to defend said vice principal, Marcelle Orsi, as they faced harsh criticism for wanting to leave the EU.She added: ldquoThe girls coped admirably with the arguments thrown at them. They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues.

Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit.

Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance. Rather than focusing on twinning towns, the emphasis is on twinning regions. We also hope to develop a three-way relationship with Rowallane and Slieve Croob, Vimianzo in Galicia and Lamorlaye.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, has praised the work and commitment of the cross-community twinning group.He added: ldquoThe group is all inclusive and open to everyone in the Rowallane and Slieve Croob area. Launched a year ago, I have no doubt that more success lies ahead, with the group building on the good work it has already achieved, fostering good relations, not just in this part of the world, but across Europe.ldquoThe possibilities the Celtic regions partnership are limitless in my opinion, helping make this district a vibrant location, not only to live and work in, but also to visit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"MRI scanner to remain at Downe for nine weeks  ","story":"A MOBILE MRI scanner at the Downe Hospital will only be in place until early April, health chiefs have confirmed.The South Eastern Trust has revealed that the scanner arrived at the Downpatrick hospital at the start of this month and is to remain in place for around nine weeks.Health officials said the arrival of the scanner is part of a ldquocontingency measure to maintain a service provision during the replacement of an MRI system at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.They have explained the scanner mdash which takes detailed images of the inside of the body mdash will help ensure that delays in patient appointments can be avoided.Over recent months, politicians and health campaigners have highlighted the need for a purpose-built MRI suite at the Downpatrick hospital, with health officials agreeing that such a facility would be a real asset to the hospital.They say it would ensure that additional MR imaging capacity was available locally to facilitate increased demand in this area of imaging.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that the organisation was currently in the process of making a case to the Department of Health to provide a permanent MRI scanner in the Downe.She added: ldquoObviously, any decision would be dependent on a successful business case as well as capital funding being made available to the Trust.Politicians and health campaigners have been calling for the capital funding and revenue required to provide an MRI scanner and cover its running costs.They say local access to such a scanner would further enhance the range of diagnostic services provided at the Downe, ensuring local people would not have to travel outside the district to use such a facility.With waiting lists for diagnostic services continuing to increase at other hospitals, which impact on local patients, politicians and health campaigners are keen to see such a fully fledged MRI service available locally.They hope the work on the business case can be completed and that the Department of Health will pave the way for the new scanner to be provided.The provision of a new scanner would be a major boost for the hospital where work is presently underway to prepare for the opening of a specialist centre of excellence for cataract surgery.The Downpatrick hospital will be at the forefront of a new model of care under new Department of Health plans for the delivery of a range of dedicated day surgery services across the province.The new cataract service is designed to signicantly reduce surgery waiting lists, with the new consultant-led, elective care centre providing routine day surgery procedures at an enhanced outpatient department.Health chiefs insist the creation of the new elective care centres represents a ldquosignicant step forward in the transformation of health care and clearly demonstrates the benefits to patients.

Her decision to take a case has been vindicated. “The damages figure is very satisfactory and all costs have been paid.”No apology is being made under the terms of the resolution.In  McCollum was caught with Scottish woman Melissa Reid attempting to smuggle £.m worth of cocaine out of Peru.They initially denied the charge, claiming that they had been forced to become mules.Known as the ‘Peru Two’, the pair later admitted to drug smuggling and were jailed for six years and eight months. Both women were released in .McCollum, now a mother-of-two, is pursuing similar privacy actions against a number of other media organisations.Mr Winters added: “We are confident that all other contentious publications, both print and online, will now be resolved without recourse to formal litigation.”Man caught with  ‘packages’ of cocaine in his body at Belfast City Airport Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

Word that he would declare the emergency prompted condemnations from Democrats and threats of lawsuits from states and others who might lose federal money or said the president was abusing his authority.The top two Democrats in Congress, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, said they will use “every remedy available” to oppose Mr Trump.They pledged to take action “in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public”, adding that Mr Trump’s decision is unlawful and would “shred the constitution” by usurping Congress’s power to control spending.Democratic state attorney generals said they would consider legal action to block Mr Trump. Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello told the president on Twitter “we’ll see you in court”he makes the declaration.Footballer jailing after kicking opponent in head and punching referee Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

This is to determineiniduals have committed any terrorist or other criminal offences, regardless their motivation, and to ensure that they do not pose a danger to the public or the UK’s national security.“There can be no hope of repatriation without these investigations taking place, and anyone who doesto the UK from conflict zones can, at best, expect to live under stringent limitations set out in the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation MeasuresAct.“We as a society must learn that we can stop this from happening in the first place by trusting our Prevent strategy, reporting our concerns early and stopping people being radicalised, investigated and, most likely, criminalised by the poisonous rhetoric spewed by terrorist organisations of any ideology.”Mr Javid said those who left the UK to join IS were “full of hate for our country”, while security minister Ben Wallace warned that runaways who now want to come back must realise that “actions have consequences”.Meanwhile Anthony Loyd, The Times correspondent who found Ms Begum, said she was a “-year-old schoolgirl who made a terrible mistake... and we must do our best to rehabilitate her amongst our own people”.But her plea has been strongly rejected by others - including the brother of Alan Henning, the British aid worker beheaded by Jihadi John, who said she should “absolutely not” be allowed back.Any hopes of a rescue mission by British officials were also swtly quashed on Thursday as the Government ruled out an effort inside Syria to assist Ms Begum.While refusing to comment on inidual cases, Mr Wallace told the BBC: “I’m not putting at risk British people’s lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state.“There’s consular services where in the region and the strong message this Government has given for many years is that actions have consequences.”While no official operation to remove Ms Begum from Syria will be carried out, questions have been raised over whether Britain would be able to prevent Ms Begum’s eventualto the UK.Former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile told the BBC thatMs Begum has not gained a second citizenship of another country, she will have to be allowed back to her homeland because under international law it is not possible for a person to be made “stateless”.Meanwhile, Richard Barrett, a former director of global counter-terrorism at MI, suggested it would be “unreasonable” to expect the Syrian Defence Force to look after her indefinitely.He also warned that summary execution is the “most likely outcome” for such captured foreign nationals who are handed over to Syrian or Iraqi authorities.try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
