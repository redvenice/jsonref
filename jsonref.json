Shoppers queue in Cardiff for Boxing Day sales    Her Majesty The Queen speaks to the nation and Commonwealth in her traditional Christmas address in 1991The original idea was suggested by Sir John Reith, the founding father of the BBC, to inaugurate the Empire Service, now the BBC World Service.George V was at first unsure about using the relatively untried medium of the wireless, but eventually agreed.The fixed time of 3pm each year was chosen in 1932 because it was considered the best for reaching most of the countries in the British Empire by short wave.King George V\u0027s eldest son, who became King Edward VIII, never delivered a Christmas speech, as his reign lasted less than a year, ending in abdication.King George VI, the Queen\u0027s father and Edward\u0027s brother, made his first broadcast in December 1937 in which he thanked the nation for their support during the first year of his reign.There was no Christmas broadcast in 1936 or 1938, and it was the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 that firmly established the tradition.The speech is written by the Queen herself and is one of the rare occasions when she does not turn to the Government for advice and is able to voice her own views.Each message has a strong religious framework and reflects current issues.She chooses a theme, drawing sometimes on her own personal experiences and sometimes from global events such as wars, terrorist attacks or natural disasters.In 2003, the Queen recorded her annual Christmas message entirely on location, away from a royal residence, for the first time.With a military backdrop of armoured fighting vehicles at Combermere Barracks in Windsor, she paid tribute to British servicemen and women who had fought in the Iraq war.The Queen sometimes watches her own speech alone on Christmas Day.The Duke of York revealed the monarch can prefer to leave the room to scrutinise her work as the rest of the royal family gather around the television together at Sandringham on December 25.Andrew recalled: \u0027I do remember that sometimes the Queen watches it and sometimes sits in another room thinking \u0027Has it come across in the right way?\u0027\u0027He added: \u0027As children we were always encouraged after lunch to behave ourselves and wait for the Queen\u0027s message, because lunch would usually finish within one or 15 minutes of quarter to three, and three o\u0027clock is the time we all sit down and watch it.\u0027The duke spoke of how other members of the royal family have taken part in the broadcast over the years.\u0027I think all of us have taken part in it in one form or another over the years,\u0027 he said.During the Falklands War when the duke served as a helicopter pilot, Andrew and his fellow servicemen were the focus of the Queen\u0027s 1982 message.\u0027The fact that the Queen, their Commander in Chief, had a concern and was thinking about what they\u0027re doing, and as it were, was with them for those few minutes, gives you a tremendous buzz and a feel that \u0027Oh we\u0027ve been mentioned, we\u0027ve been thought about\u0027,\u0027 he told ITV.                                                     "},{"url":null,"title":"Families complain supermarkets RUINED Christmas mouldy turkeys","story":"    One frustrated shopper said her essential Waitrose butter basted turkey crown was inedible when defrosted          Families have claimed their Christmases were \u0027ruined\u0027 after discovering their turkeys were \u0027rotten\u0027 and \u0027rancid\u0027          Customers from Sainsbury\u0027s said they found \u0027green\u0027 meat when they opened the packaging          Nicola Thorn said she paid over £40 for a turkey from Morrisons only to find it \u0027stinky, green and rotton\u0027Kelly, who purchased an essential Waitrose butter basted turkey crown for Christmas Day, said her bird was inedible when defrosted.She said: \u0027Wasn\u0027t able to eat it unfortunately - very much off!

Who are these people? Why are these people not looking after themselves?\u0027He derided Egyptians for not walking enough and, laughing, turned to his prime minister - seated next to him - and told him not to put on weight.Egypt\u0027s pro-government media prominently trumpeted his comments. Parliament, packed by his supporters, has said it intends to introduce legislation making physical education part of the core curriculum at schools. Similarly, his education minister said students taking a 10-stop ride on the Cairo metro should get off two stops early and walk to their destination as a form of exercise.In social media, possibly the only platform of relatively free speech left in Egypt, the response was more critical. Some said el-Sissi was removed from reality or speaks his mind without weighing his words first. A flood of jokes spilled forth on Twitter and Facebook, playing on the risks of being too fat under a president whose security forces have arrested thousands in a widespread crackdown against dissent.          An academic survey found one in three Egyptians were obese, although experts suggest this may be due to the high cost of fruit and vegetables in the country One joke that went viral told of people in a car sucking in their bellies as they approached a police checkpoint. Another has a man asking to hide at a friend\u0027s house from police until he loses weight. In another, a man informs on his overweight wife to authorities on the phone.Political analyst Amar Ali Hassan said the comments \u0027laid bare a great deal of elitism\u0027.He continued: \u0027They are symptomatic of an authoritarian ruler who\u0027s convinced he\u0027s on a mission, that he alone knows what is in the public interest while everyone else is ignorant of the lofty goals in his head.\u0027Since taking office in 2014, el-Sissi has depicted himself as trying to refashion Egypt into a prosperous, stable and modern nation. But he has made sure there is no one influential or brave enough to question any of his policies or offer alternatives. He once angrily told Egyptians to listen to him alone and shouted down a lawmaker who suggested delaying the lifting of subsidies. This month, he declared he did not allow feasibility studies to be the deciding factor on the multi-billion-dollar projects he has embarked on.Some of his policies have seen successes. The country is slowly recovering from the economic slump it suffered in the years after a 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Security has improved.But el-Sissi has also sought to quash any opposition, jailing thousands of Islamists along with secular pro-democracy activists, silencing critics in the media, reversing freedoms won in the 2011 uprising and winning a second term in office this year after authorities jailed potentially serious challengers or intimidated them out of the race.Some longtime el-Sissi critics commended him for drawing attention to the need to fight obesity. But they pointed out that Egypt\u0027s poor majority cannot afford to eat healthy when a diet of sugar and carbs is cheaper.Human rights lawyer Mohamed Zaree said el-Sissi needs to enable Egyptians to lose weight rather than ordering them to exercise.\u0027He needs to make healthy food available at low prices, set up venues where people can exercise and allow emergency obesity operations to be performed under the cover of the state\u0027s medical care system.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans given low curtseying","story":"Meghan\u0027s curtsy to the Queen this year (left) was much deeper and more profound than her attempt last year (right), royal  observers said  Kate\u0027s curtsy from last year (pictured) was deep and respectful, according to royal insiders.

Here is Money Mail’s definitive guide to returning those not-so perfect presents...Can I secretly exchange a gift?Secretly returning or exchanging unwanted gifts can be tricky, as most shops will have to see proof of purchase.But, while retailers have the right to refuse to help you without a receipt, many will offer an exchange or a voucher for the item’s current value.You could bite the bullet and ask your loved one for the receipt, but even this isn’t a foolproof solution. Under the Consumer Rights Act, retailers are not obliged to offer shoppers a refund or exchange for unwanted items that are not faulty or damaged. Most major stores will accept returns if the item is in a resaleable condition, but inidual returns policies vary.Any refunds will go back on to the debit or credit card used to purchase the item — so you may want to ask for a credit note instead, if you’re not planning to inform the gift-buyer. If an item is faulty, shops are obliged to refund customers, but you will still need to show proof of purchase.The rules are different with online purchases as, under consumer law, you have a 14-day cooling-off period. This means you have two weeks to notify the seller that you want to return an item for any reason, then another 14 days to send it back.Got an expensive new gadget for Christmas? How to make sure...Westpac and ANZ glitches leave thousands of shoppers unable...Share this articleHowever, you would need to inform whoever gave you the present in order to be able to provide proof that the item was bought online.If the gift came from Amazon and you have an account yourself, you may be able to get the money put on a gift card without anyone knowing — but only if the order had been marked as a gift. You can do this by ticking the ‘this is a gift’ box at purchase. If you are not sure, contact Amazon on 0800 279 7234 for more information.Anyone can return an Amazon gift if they have the order number, but the money will go back to the card that paid for it, so it won’t be a secret.How long do I have to return an item?   For non-faulty items, most stores have their own policy. For example, Argos has a 30-day money-back guarantee that allows customers to return goods if they change their mind.Ikea, on the other hand, gives you 365 days to return unwanted goods for a refund or exchange, as long as they are in a resaleable condition.Around Christmas time, many shops extend the window in which you can bring back unwanted presents if you have a receipt.          Shoppers with faulty goods and a receipt have 30 days to return the product for a refundAt Sainsbury’s, for example, items bought between November 1 this year and January 3, 2019 can be returned until January 31, 2019.

But gifts bought from October 13 can be returned until January 20.Argos customers can return any purchases made from October 11 to December 25 for a full refund or exchange until January 25, 2019.For faulty goods where you have the receipt, you have 30 days to get a full refund, regardless of the store policy. If items develop a fault within six months, under the Consumer Rights Act you can return them for repair or replacement.After six months, you can still take an item back, but the burden is on you to prove there was a fault at the time you bought it.Anything I can\u0027t take back? Each shop will have its own list of non-returnable items. Generally, if it is perishable (such as flowers) or personalised (say, a football shirt with your name on the back), it would be refused.The same applies if the item can’t be reused for hygiene reasons, such as jewellery, swimwear or a sealed item with the seal broken.          M\u0026ampS has a list of items that cannot be returned. These include bras, duvets and pillowsMarks \u0026amp Spencer has a long list of excluded items, including beauty products, bras, duvets, earrings, flowers, food, fruit baskets, gift cards, mattress protectors, pillows, plants, swimwear, toiletries, wine and electrical goods.Selfridges refuses returns of many of these items, as well as event tickets, opened CDs, DVDs, computer games and headphones, and newspapers, periodicals and magazines.Can I return it on Boxing Day?While most shops on the High Street will be open for business on Boxing Day, not all will accept returns on this day. JD Sports’s official line, for instance, is that it does not refund or exchange goods between December 26 and 28.A spokesman says this ‘allows for a greater shopping experience’ during the busiest days of the year by reducing queue waiting times.But if you do turn up on Boxing Day to return unwanted goods, JD Sports says staff will act with discretion and process refunds if possible.Trainer shop Size will not accept any returns between December 26 and 29 and Footpatrol will not be offering exchanges or refunds until December 29.John Lewis stores are not open on Boxing Day, but will process returns from December 27.Boots, Debenhams, Sainsbury’s, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Carphone Warehouse and Currys are all open on Boxing Day and accepting returns.B\u0026ampQ accepts returns, but stores are only open from 10am to 4pm. Tesco, H Samuel and Ernest Jones say they will accept returns in the stores that are open, but not all of them are.Online delivery didn\u0027t show up When ordering items online, your contract is with the retailer, rather than the delivery company.If the seller said your goods would arrive in time for Christmas and they turn up late, it is in breach of contract and you can demand a refund under the Consumer Rights Act. In some cases, you may be able to claim compensation if you have taken time off work for a parcel that never arrived.If items arrived damaged and the retailer can’t prove they arrived safely or were left in an appropriate place, then they must give you a refund.If you want to send something back, you usually have to pay the return cost unless the retailer says otherwise. You should get back the postage you originally paid. If the item is faulty, the postage cost should be covered under the Consumer Rights Act.Either way, keep your proof of postage in case the retailer claims the package never arrived.Can I exchange a voucher?Sites such as Groupon and Wowcher offer vouchers that can be redeemed for goods from local retailers or experiences including spa days and cooking lessons.Groupon has extended its usual 14-day refund policy for Christmas. Most vouchers bought between November 13 and December 21 can be returned up to and including January 14, unless stated in the terms and conditions.Vouchers for baby products, bedding and jewellery are likely to be excluded from the returns policy.Groupon says refunds are done directly via customer accounts, but it wants to look at changing this policy to make the process ‘easier and less awkward’ if the recipient wants a refund. It can take five to seven days for cash to reach a customer’s bank account.Wowcher, a similar company, has the same returns policy all year round. Customers can cancel an order up to 14 days after receiving the items for a full refund.There are exceptions, though, such as with flights and personalised items.Returns will be accepted after 14 days but, instead of cash, you will be offered credit to use on the Wowcher website. You will get credit for 100 pc of what you paid if you redeem a voucher after 14 days but before 30 days. After 30 days, you will get a 50 pc credit note.With Virgin Experience Days, you should be able to exchange your voucher for a different event.For refunds, you must return your paper voucher within 14 days or contact the customer service department if you have an e-voucher.What to do with that gift card?            Physical and electronic gift cards and printable coupons can be sold on the website Zeek.meIf you know that you won’t spend a gift card, you can sell it through specialist websites, but are unlikely to get cash for the full value.Physical and electronic gift cards and printable coupons can be sold on the website Zeek.me if they are worth between £10 and £500 and valid for at least a month. The card must be redeemable online or in stores with at least five branches.Zeek accepts cards for more than 200 brands including Debenhams, Next, WHSmith and National Trust and claims most sell within hours.The selling price depends on what gift card you have and whether you want cash or credit to buy other gift cards on the website.When we checked the Zeek site, we found a £50 Debenhams gift card would get you £47 credit or £40 paid into your PayPal or bank account. Zeek will offer £20 credit for a £20 Sainsbury’s card or voucher, or £15 cash. You can sell a £30 Next gift card for £28 credit or £23.80 will be paid by bank transfer.The resell price varies by brand and is based on the discount buyers will need to receive to find the gift card appealing.Cardyard.co.uk is another option, but gift cards and vouchers must have at least three months’ validity and it pays less than Zeek. For example, you get just £39.50 for a £50 Debenhams card or £41.48 credit.Do charity shops accept pressies?Charity shops are likely to be closed on Boxing Day, though some may be open Sunday hours.

Empty shops should be transformed into community centres or leisure facilities to help existing retail businesses survive. Others could be converted into homes to ensure high streets do not become no-go areas. He called on councils to appoint ‘high street sheriffs’ to help.Shops should do more to make their outlets welcoming to customers, he said. High street firms complain about having to pay high business rates while online giants pay little tax, and Mr Berry said he knew ministers needed to act.He reiterated that, if there is no international agreement, the Government will bring in an internet purchase tax by 2020 to ensure internet firms pay their fair share.The £5 BILLION Boxing Day sales spree: A third of Britons...Disgraced Labour MP Kate Osamor says she is \u0027proud\u0027 to live...Share this articleHe urged local authorities to bid for a share of a £675million pot to help transform high streets into community hubs.Mr Berry told the Mail: ‘They may look to bring in childcare centres, GP surgeries and libraries into town centres.

Where I have seen it succeed, the free parking lasts for two hours or so, and it means new people keep coming back with fresh money in their pockets.’          Mr Berry believes empty shops could be transformed into community centres           Mr Berry said the government was considering introducing an internet purchase tax to level the playing field with the high street and town centre          Mr Berry believes making parking easier in town centres will bring back shoppers Councils in England made an £819million surplus from parking fines, fees and permits last year.The Local Government Association says the money is ploughed back into local transport and maintaining car parks.But critics who say town halls use motorists as cash cows will welcome the minister’s call. Mr Berry said he is optimistic about the future of high streets despite the threat posed by online firms.‘This Christmas, 80 per cent of purchases are still being made face to face,’ he said. ‘The market place was the first social network, and the personal touch that the high street can bring needs to be maintained in the future.’The £675million Future High Streets Fund was announced in the Budget and followed recommendations from town centre expert Sir John Timpson.Last night he said: ‘I have learnt, from my own business, that the best way to get things done is to give people on the frontline the freedom to get on with the job in the way they know best.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Meghan ordered call Christmas Day truce Queen","story":"    The Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex were seen laughing and joking arriving at St Mary Magdalene churchLook Royal in red like the Duchess of CambridgeGet the look belowThe Duchess of Cambridge was radiant in red this morning as she joined the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family at church for the Christmas Day service in Sandringham.Kate looked breathtaking in a brick red double-breasted Catherine Walker coat, which she teamed with matching court shoes by Gianvito Rossi, and a Mulberry clutch.

Spacey reprised his role as Frank Underwood from the Netflix drama House of CardsThat was when the actor Anthony Rapp accused the then 26-year-old Spacey of making a sexual advance to him in 1986 when Rapp was just 14 and attending a party at the actor\u0027s apartment. In a statement, Spacey claimed to have no memory of the alleged incident while offering an apology to Rapp, now 47, for \u0027what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour\u0027.In that same Twitter post Spacey — whose sexuality had been the subject of speculation over many years — said he\u0027d had relationships with both men and women, but that he \u0027chooses now to live as a gay man\u0027. He was roundly condemned for using the Rabb scandal to \u0027come out\u0027.In the days and weeks that followed, a string of men came forward to accuse Spacey of sexual assault.He was thrown off the Netflix series after claims he made it a \u0027toxic\u0027 environment and at least one allegation of sexual assault by someone working on the show.He was, it seemed, the latest big name to be sucked into the maelstrom of MeToo movement fury, first sparked by the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, at serious sexual misconduct by powerful men in Hollywood.At first glance, Spacey\u0027s latest small-screen appearance, posted online on Monday, suggested Netflix had forgiven him and — despite having supposedly killed off his character — might be about to welcome their main star back into the fold for another season.          Spacey, pictured here in the 1995 movie The Usual Suspects, is due to appear at Nantucket District Court on January 7 accused of a single count of \u0027indecent assault and battery on a person who is at least 14 years oldCould the video clip be a taster, the crafty Underwood pleading his innocence for his murder of a journalist and a politician in House Of Cards?The truth, however, is rather more alarming. It seems that Spacey was responding to a decision by police and prosecutors in Massachusetts to charge him over allegations that he sexually abused an 18-year-old male at a Nantucket bar more than two years ago.Spacey, now 59, is scheduled to be arraigned at Nantucket District Court on January 7 on a single charge of \u0027indecent assault and battery on a person who is at least 14 years old\u0027. The alleged victim is the son of a Boston television journalist, Heather Unruh. It was back in November 2017, shortly after the allegations by Anthony Rapp, that she came forward to allege that her 18-year-old son was sexually assaulted by the actor at The Club Car restaurant and bar in Nantucket, a holiday island off Cape Cod beloved of the East Coast elite, on July 7, 2016.At a news conference, Unruh said her \u0027star-struck\u0027 son falsely told the actor he was old enough to drink when he met him at the bar. The legal age for drinking alcohol in public in Massachusetts is 21.\u0027Kevin Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink, and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him,\u0027 Unruh said.The actor stuck his hands into her son\u0027s pants and grabbed his genitals, she said, adding it was \u0027completely unexpected\u0027 and her son tried unsuccessfully to shift his body away from Spacey. When the star went to the lavatory, her son fled, she added. She said her son, who hadn\u0027t reported the alleged crime at the time out of embarrassment and fear, had finally gone to the police shortly before she gave her news conference.Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer representing Spacey\u0027s accuser, said in a statement: \u0027Let the facts be presented, the relevant law applied and a just and fair verdict rendered.\u0027The Nantucket case is just one of many tawdry allegations made against Spacey, although the statute of limitations has run out on many of them, meaning that it\u0027s too late to prosecute him.In all, more than 30 men have said they were victims of unwanted sexual advances by him. While no formal charges have, until now, been filed, police in Los Angeles and London are investigating allegations of sexual assault, including rape.In the UK, there are six active investigations.          The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was acclaimed artistic director, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his 11-year tenure up to 2015The Old Vic theatre in London, where Spacey was acclaimed artistic director, said it had received 20 complaints of inappropriate behaviour during his 11-year tenure up to 2015.Of those 20 allegations from current and former staff, 14 were serious enough for the theatre to advise complainants to go to the police. Management at the theatre admitted that Spacey\u0027s star power had contributed to a \u0027cult of personality\u0027 that allowed his actions to go unchallenged.In the subsequent fallout, Spacey not only lost his role in House Of Cards, but director Ridley Scott erased him from his completed film All The Money In The World, spending millions of pounds re-shooting with Christopher Plummer instead playing billionaire John Paul Getty.Spacey\u0027s other film project, Billionaire Boys Club, which he made prior to the sexual assault allegations, was considered a record-breaking flop, taking in just $126 (£98) on its opening night in the U.S.An already completed biopic about the American writer Gore Vidal, played by Spacey, was simply scrapped. The toxic allegation even forced his charity, The Kevin Spacey Foundation UK, which helps emerging actors, to close. Its trustees simply stated that their work was \u0027no longer viable\u0027.Until now, Spacey — who last posted a message online in October last year — had all but disappeared not only from social media but from the real world.The last-known pictures of him were snapped as he jogged in the grounds of a £25,000-a-month rehab facility, the Meadows Clinic in Arizona, in November last year where he was receiving treatment for sex addiction — coincidentally at the same time as Harvey Weinstein — on a 45-day \u0027detox\u0027. Sources say he checked out after only 21 days.Although he owns homes on both sides of the Atlantic, Spacey has not been seen at any of them.Friends said he was becoming a complete recluse. He is believed to have visited New York at least once, but has stayed with a rich friend from the theatre world.Staff at his Manhattan apartment building insisted they hadn\u0027t seen him since the scandal first broke.He also has not been sighted at his £2.3 million penthouse flat overlooking the Thames in London, where he used to hold famously decadent late-night parties.It emerged earlier this year that he had secretly sold his Los Angeles house for $11 million to build up a fighting fund to protect himself from legal challenges and try to salvage his reputation.A British friend claims Spacey has been living in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific and using his real name — Kevin Fowler — allowing him to travel with a low profile.\u0027He\u0027s keeping his head down until this blows over. He still has a lot of rich friends from his Old Vic days. He has enough money to stay hidden,\u0027 the friend told the Mail on Sunday earlier this year.Another source, someone who worked with him on House Of Cards, said he has been hiding in the South of France.A third claim is that he has gone to ground at a rented ranch in Thousand Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles, staying with a friend and — according to a former associate — living as a \u0027hermit\u0027 and never going out.So Spacey\u0027s surprise Christmas appearance in the YouTube video has inevitably caused something of a stir. Shot in a state-of-the-art kitchen, it would certainly suggest he\u0027s not living in a mud hut in the back of beyond.At least one former associate claims to have been phoned by Spacey, describing him as \u0027genuinely baffled that everyone has turned their backs on him\u0027 and \u0027indignant\u0027 at having been deserted.That would certainly tally with his YouTube monologue which, in demeaningly rebutting the accusations against him \u0027in character\u0027, smacked of an overweening vanity and ego.Fellow actors and showbiz personalities have responded accordingly, with disbelief and outrage at his actions. One of them, actress Rosanna Arquette, posted the following blunt message: \u0027Kevin Spacey has apparently lost his mind. What an absurd video…this is only the beginning. There are many more victims.\u0027Even his older brother Randy, 62, said: \u0027My brother was always an arrogant p****.\u0027 It would be difficult to disagree after his latest performance.Randy, with whom he shared a famously dysfunctional upbringing with an abusive father, has had very little contact with his famous sibling for years, but believes that Spacey is \u0027lying low\u0027 in the belief the \u0027water will cool\u0027.Indeed, Spacey\u0027s only allies appear to be his two lawyers. Other friends have been extremely limited in their support, focusing on his acting talent.Long-time pal Dame Judi Dench has defended Spacey to the extent of saying she \u0027can\u0027t approve\u0027 of the way he was removed from the Getty film and described him as a \u0027most wonderful actor\u0027, while his House Of Cards co-star Diane Lane admitted she had \u0027tremendous respect for his artistry\u0027.None of his famous friends — and he was for so long the \u0027luvvie\u0027s luvvie\u0027 on both sides of the Atlantic — have stepped up to defend his personal behaviour.Sally Greene, who appointed him at the Old Vic, said the affair made her \u0027sick to (her) stomach\u0027.Veteran gay rights advocate Sir Ian McKellen commented: \u0027The one thing I would say about Mr Spacey is that he was a gay man and he was pretending not to be.\u0027Meanwhile, the actress Robin Wright, who played Frank Underwood\u0027s wife in House Of Cards, has distanced herself from Spacey, claiming she didn\u0027t know him at all apart from on a professional level.Australian actor Guy Pearce, who starred with Spacey in the 1997 film LA Confidential, has perhaps been the most honest of all when asked about Spacey\u0027s on-set behaviour. \u0027He\u0027s a handsy guy. Thankfully, I was 29 and not 14.\u0027Spacey — who won Oscars for American Beauty and The Usual Suspects, as well as acclaim for his role as a serial killer in Seven — may be alone in thinking he can salvage his career and, according to insiders, has developed a gradual rehabilitation plan that he has outlined to his remaining friends.It begins with them starting to talk positively about Spacey in public and, then, he would accept a cameo role in a respectable film.A website called supportkevin spacey.com — creators unknown — invites fans to leave supportive messages, some of which have come from people who claim the actor is a victim of homophobia.In his statement last October, when allegations first emerged, Spacey said about his private life: \u0027I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behaviour.\u0027How different he sounded then to his defiant tone in his bizarre Christmas message, in which he claims: \u0027My confidence grows each day that soon enough you will know the full truth.\u0027We\u0027re not done, no matter what anyone says.\u0027No doubt his alleged victims feel the same."},{"url":null,"title":"Britains 44 mile walk wont cross road","story":"    According to researchers at Ordnance Survey (OS), the longest walk in Britain without coming across around is a stretch in Scotland in the Cairngorms National ParkWith a high point of 3,870ft at the summit of Beinn a\u0027Bhuird, the most hardy of climbers will need to come prepared with crampons and ice axes in order to navigate their way through the course.The route has some of the most beautiful natural scenery anywhere in the British isles, from the stunning Corgarff Castle, which was the site of the 16th-century massacre, to the hills range the Cairngorm plateau. It comes after a member of the public asked the OS geographers what the longest route is in Britain without encountering a road.

Hundreds of people attended the Essex Hunt meeting at Matching Green Essex this morning - and some enjoyed a wee dram to keep away the winter chill          The huntsman of the Essex Hunt blows his horn to start the hunt from the Chequers pub for the traditional Boxing Day meet          The Essex Hunt has met regularly in Matching Green since the early 19th century, although since the 2004 Hunting Act it has not been allowed to use dogs to chase and kill foxesIf any saboteurs do breach the injunction in Peterborough today they could be held in contempt of court and be at risk of imprisonment or a fine. The protesters have signed legal documents  stating they will only go on public rights of way running through the Milton Hall estate in Cambridgeshire, owned by joint Master Sir Philip Naylor-Leyland.Polly Portwin, the Countryside Alliance\u0027s Head of Hunting, told The Telegraph: \u0027The Fitzwilliam Hunt have been forced to take action through the courts after years of being followed around by a group of obsessive animal rights activists that persistently trespass on private land in their attempt to disrupt the hunt carrying out their lawful hunting activities.           Henley Mills, 5, is sniffed by a hound as members of the Albrighton \u0026amp Woodland Hunt gather at Hagley Hall near Stourbidge in the West Midlands for the Boxing Day hunt          Young Henley rode a Shetland pony to join in with the Albrighton \u0026amp Woodland Hunt at Hagley Hall near Stourbidge           Picking up the scent: Since the 2004 fox hunt ban, hunters follow trails around the grounds where hounds sniff out the scent of foxes without any animals being harmed          Hunt supporters greet riders meeting for the Avon Vale Hunt\u0027s traditional Boxing Day in Lacock near Chippenham in Wiltshire          Members of the Avon Vale Hunt set off from the village of Lacock in Wiltshire for the annual Boxing Day hunt          Experienced huntsmen and some riders new to the experience were cheered through the streets by supporters in Avon Vale          Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, complete with trademark pint, cigarette and frayed Barbour jacket, was among supporters at the Old Surrey Burstow and West Kent Boxing day Hunt meet at Chiddingstone Castle, Chiddingstone\u0027The Hunting Act became law nearly 14 years ago yet animal rights activists remain obsessed with hunts and are angry that packs have maintained their infrastructure, their kennels, and their hounds.\u0027Meanwhile the support in the rural community still thrives with a quarter of a million people expected to turn out to support hunts again on Boxing Day.\u0027 All but one protester named in the temporary injunction signed the legal agreement, after it was agreed costs would not be pursued against them. Granting the temporary injunction, Mr Justice Freedman said that he had \u0027come to the view that the evidence as a whole does lead to a concern that without protection against trespass to land there is reason to be concerned about public order disturbances\u0027 and \u0027of the possibility of injury to people as well as injury or damage to or caused by animals becoming out of control\u0027. The judge outlined his decision in a ruling following a High Court hearing in London in which protesters had contested the complaints of trespass. Mr Justice Freedman said claims and counter-claims could be fully analysed at a trial and added the injunctions might be lifted following any trial.   A group of anti-hunt demonstrators had their car smashed up on land used by the Fitzwilliam (Milton) Hunt          The back window of the car was shattered and several occupants claim to have received injuries from the broken glassIt is thought that  the injunction is the first granted since the Hunting Act came into force in early 2005. The Crawley and Horsham Hunt in Sussex attempted similar action a decade ago but the case was abandoned. In February, North Cambridgeshire Hunt Saboteurs Association were monitoring the Fitzwilliam Hunt when they were set upon by a handful of men in tweed flat caps in a narrow country lane. Footage published by MailOnline shows the hunt saboteurs\u0027 car surrounded by the high-powered vehicles, with one skidding in front of them to block them in, before four people jump out. One then approaches the saboteur\u0027s car with what appears to be a torch and smashes in several of their windows.The decision to grant an injunction on against comes as saboteurs across the country have tried to force Boxing Day hunts onto private land by lobbying councils - arguing hunts breaches health and safety rules.Kate and Meghan are all smiles as they walk to Christmas serviceViolence erupts at traditional Boxing Day hunt in NewportPregnant Meghan pulls off deeper curtsy at SandringhamKate and Meghan look united as they arrive for Sandringham serviceCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offFurious driver rams its way through cars in car park chaosElle Stevenson features in series of BBC\u0027s The ApprenticeCute pooch gets festive as it jumps at Meghan in SandringhamPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allHundreds gather to meet Kate and Meghan on Christmas daySpanish police catch drug runners in dramatic high-speed chaseEarly risers! Shoppers queue in Cardiff for Boxing Day salesBut the Countryside Alliance hit back by launching a campaign to protect Boxing Day meets.It made the move after councils received detailed requests about preparations for their staging on council land. Broadway Parish Council which hosts the North Cotswold Hunt and Dalston Parish Council, organiser of Cumberland Farmers Foxhounds – have received the requests for health and safety information,However, pro-hunt campaigners say the health and safety tactic is a \u0027cynical way of trying to stop rural people gathering and enjoying themselves at Christmas\u0027. Last month Grantham Labour Party told Lincolnshire Police it opposing the Boxing Day meet of the Belvoir Hunt and the mayor has now pulled out of the event.Tetbury Town Council earlier this month declared that the Beaufort Hunt could no longer use its land after residents complained they were being forced to walk aside on narrow footpaths used by horses.Tim Bonner, Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance said the anti-hunt movement is \u0027driven by hatred of people\u0027, as opposed to \u0027any real interest in animal welfare\u0027.He added hunts have been \u0027hunting artificial trails on Boxing Day since the law changed in 2005\u0027 , but activists are still obsessed with attacking them.     The Hunting Act came into force on February 18, 2005, and banned the hunting of mammals with dogs in England and Wales.Around 250 hunts were expected to meet around the UK for traditional Boxing Day hunts today, with up to 250,000 people taking part or watching.Since fox hunting was outlawed in 2004, pursuit of live animals has been replaced by trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent such as fox urine.Activists have claimed these events can effectively allow banned practices to continue, if trails are laid near where foxes are likely to be.Hunt becomes the first in the country to be granted an injunction to protect from saboteursProtesters and supporters clash at Tredegar Arms Boxing Day Hunt | South Wales Argus"},{"url":null,"title":"British couple wed Las Vegas Christmas Day just days meeting time","story":"    Sarah Elliott, 34, and Paul Edwards, 36, at their marriage in Las Vegas in the US. They first matched online on December 15They committed to each other and booked a wedding venue - the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.Meeting for the first time at Gatwick Airport on Christmas Eve, the duo boarded a plane in full wedding gear and jetted off to Las Vegas to get married.Mrs Edwards, a nanny originally from New Zealand but who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: \u0027We instantly clicked - there was an undeniable connection.\u0027I feel like Paul\u0027s my best friend already.\u0027We\u0027re not looking at everything through rose-tinted glasses. We know it will be challenging, but we\u0027re willing to work together.\u0027I\u0027m usually such a logical person, but all the rules have been thrown out.          Meeting for the first time at Gatwick Airport on Christmas Eve, the duo boarded a plane in full wedding gear and jetted off to Las Vegas to get married\u0027We\u0027ve both tried to do things the traditional way before and it didn\u0027t work out for either of us.\u0027We get on so well and just thought: \u0027Why not have that commitment to actually making a marriage work from the very start?\u0027\u0027I\u0027m not interested in just going on dates looking for things I don\u0027t like about that person.\u0027I\u0027m committing to making this marriage absolutely work - like they did in the old days.\u0027It\u0027s traditional, older generations might have only met their partner once or twice before getting married.          The couple after their wedding, posing in front of a fountain at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas\u0027It\u0027s similar, we just hadn\u0027t even met before.\u0027Mrs Edwards and her new husband, who works in broadcasting, met online on dating app Bumble and instantly hit it off.Mr Edwards was due to marry in March last year, but his fiancee left him four weeks before the wedding.Mrs Edwards broke up with her ex in February - however they are still living together, but are in the process of selling the house they own.She said: \u0027I saw his profile, thought he looked nice and loved what he had written about being open and honest.\u0027When we matched, I sent him a message.  The couple pictured meeting in public for the first time at Gatwick Airport (left) and with their luggage as they prepare to board a flight to Las Veas\u0027I thought it was funny that his name was Paul as I currently share a house with two other people called Paul - so I said: \u0027I\u0027ve already got two Paul\u0027s in my life, why not add a third?\u0027\u0027He replied to my message saying: \u0027Apparently the third Paul is always the best and I don\u0027t have a Sarah in my life so I guess that would make you number one.\u0027\u0027We spoke on the phone on Saturday night for two-and-a-half hours and then again on Sunday morning for an hour-and-a-half.\u0027Sunday evening we were chatting away on the phone and calling each other for three hours.\u0027I can\u0027t remember who brought it up, but one of us said: \u0027We get on so well - maybe we should get married\u0027.          Mr Edwards places the engagement ring on his soon to be wife\u0027s finger. He told how he was due to marry in March last year, but his fiancee left him four weeks before the wedding\u0027The other one went: \u0027Yeah, maybe we should\u0027 and it literally spiralled from there.\u0027There was a moment between us where we both thought: \u0027We totally could do this. How amazing would it be if we got married on our first date?\u0027\u0027By Monday morning - three days after we\u0027d first started talking - we\u0027d agreed to get married.\u0027We both just thought: \u0027Let\u0027s do this\u0027.\u0027Sarah knew the idea was \u0027crazy\u0027 but has decided to let her heart rule over her head.She said: \u0027I know it\u0027s totally crazy - hardly any of my friends are supporting me, in fact, a lot of them are disowning me.          The couple get to know each other after their first meeting at Gatwick Airport\u0027We experienced the moment the way Steph did\u0027: Guests wear...Who\u0027ll find love on our blind date? This week it\u0027s Shereen,...Share this article\u0027I haven\u0027t told my family yet. As they\u0027re on the other side of the world we don\u0027t talk as often as we should.\u0027Father-of-two Mr Edwards, from Chichester, West Sussex, has two daughters aged 13 and 15 from a previous relationship, and is also yet to tell his children about his new wife-to-be.Mr Edwards said: \u0027There was no awkwardness it was very natural.\u0027We continued the next day - chatting for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening.  The newlyweds both met at the airport in their wedding gear before boarding a plane to Las Vegas (left) and (right) one of the early text messages between the pair in which one writes: Let\u0027s get married then\u0027\u0027We talked about our past experiences and what we wanted in the future - and I really opened up to her, more than I have with anyone before.\u0027I felt a very strong connection from that moment.\u0027We decided to video chat so we knew we were real people.\u0027I think the whole idea came about because I asked her what she was doing for Christmas.\u0027She told me she thought she was going to a friend\u0027s house but she wasn\u0027t too sure.          Mrs Edwards sits down for a drink after meeting her soon to be husband at Gatwick Airport\u0027I said I\u0027d probably be doing the same as my family are all away in Egypt over Christmas.\u0027I said to her: \u0027How about we have our first date on Christmas Day? I\u0027ll come and meet you.\u0027\u0027She said: \u0027That sounds really nice.\u0027\u0027Then I had another light bulb moment and suggested: \u0027How about we go away on holiday for our first date?\u0027 Life\u0027s too short.\u0027The subject of marriage came up and Sarah said: \u0027I have always thought about going on that program where couples get married at first sight.\u0027I laughed and said: \u0027Let\u0027s get married then\u0027 .          The couple, seen here chatting before they boarded the plane, say they couldn\u0027t be better suited to one another\u0027She said: \u0027Don\u0027t tempt me\u0027.\u0027But later that day she called me and said: \u0027I\u0027ve bought the wedding dress\u0027.\u0027I said: \u0027Are you serious?\u0027 and she told me: \u0027If I say something I mean it.\u0027\u0027She asked me if I still wanted to get married and I thought: \u0027Yeah, why not? I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone being better suited to me.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s absolutely mental.\u0027We just carried on talking and planning and deciding where we could go and get married at such short notice.\u0027We looked at the Caribbean, New York and Las Vegas and Vegas just seemed to stick, it\u0027s the place to run away and elope.\u0027I was supposed to get married in March this year, but everything happens for a reason - I\u0027m a true believer in that.Mrs Edwards has been married before, but it only lasted for six months.          The new couple moments after they tied the knot. They are now hoping to move in together when they get back to the UK - but she still lives with her ex partner, and they are in the process of selling their houseShe says the pair get on so well because they are so alike.She said: \u0027Paul\u0027s personality is exactly like mine. We\u0027re both very bubbly, open, honest, we\u0027d do anything for anyone.\u0027He\u0027s caring, loyal, silly, a wind up, playful, intelligent and of course, spontaneous and impulsive.\u0027We have so much in common. I\u0027ve never met anyone whose brain works like mine but his does.\u0027Our minds jump all over the place with a million ideas a day. We both have big goals and dreams.\u0027She is adamant the couple will go the distance.She said: \u0027Our marriage will work because we\u0027re completely open and honest about everything in our lives. I have faith.\u0027If we have any problems, we\u0027ll talk them through.\u0027We can talk about absolutely everything - there\u0027s nothing I\u0027d feel uncomfortable discussing with him because I know there\u0027s no judgement there.\u0027Paul was wavering the other day and getting anxious. He said: \u0027Are we really going to do this?\u0027\u0027We talked it through - as a team - and decided we had as good a chance as anyone.\u0027By the end of the conversation, we were like: \u0027We\u0027ve got this\u0027.\u0027The pair decided to meet for the first time at Gatwick airport on Christmas Eve, and Paul suprised Sarah with a bunch of flowers.Sarah said: \u0027I\u0027d only just met him at the airport and he brought flowers and got down on one knee.\u0027He bought the perfect ring, it\u0027s got six diamonds on it. He\u0027s not a rich man but he knows how to treat someone.\u0027He bought me a watch too, I don\u0027t know how he knew I needed one.\u0027The flight was about 11 hours. It was hard, I was freaking out. I didn\u0027t have cold feet bus I was scared.\u0027I\u0027d just met this guy in person for the first time but we already had a connection.\u0027We talked about this before we met, it\u0027s not about what someone looks like it\u0027s what they\u0027re like on the inside.\u0027He\u0027s amazingly kind, he\u0027s incredible. He really is.\u0027He can get on with anyone and I can get on with anyone, it\u0027s amazing. The whole thing is amazing.\u0027We got married at the Bellagio, My dress was incredible. It was huge, I\u0027ve been walking up and down the strip in it.\u0027The wedding was amazing, the minister was great - we wanted to write our own vows but we didn\u0027t have time.\u0027The minister was Roland August, the Mobile Minister - he\u0027s starred in a Katy Perry Video.\u0027He wrote our vows for us, and even though he\u0027d never met us they were very personal and sweet.\u0027I\u0027m sure the wedding night will be amazing too.\u0027You can have sexual attraction, but at the end of the day they have to be a good person.\u0027You think you know people, but it doesn\u0027t matter how long you\u0027ve been with someone for, they can surprise you and not in a good way.\u0027I\u0027d been with my ex for three years and he turned out to not be capable of treating me right. You just don\u0027t know.\u0027So this time I thought: \u0027Why not take a chance and have a bit of faith?\u0027Paul said: \u0027It\u0027s absolutely mental.\u0027If you\u0027d have asked me nine days ago whether I would meet someone, start talking to them and then go running off to Vegas to get married without meeting face-to-face I\u0027d say you were crazy.\u0027I don\u0027t know what happened, it\u0027s so weird as both of radius\u0027 on Bumble weren\u0027t even that close so I have no idea how we came across each other in the first place.\u0027Sarah just seemed really lovely, when she first phoned me we spoke for over three hours.      Mr and Mrd Edwards hope to move in together when they return to the UK.She said: \u0027My ex and I broke up in February,\u0027Paul and I have tried to talk about moving in together, but it\u0027s difficult because of my current situation.\u0027Hopefully it\u0027ll only be a few more weeks before my house sale goes through.\u0027Whatever happens, we\u0027ll make it work - even if we have to rent somewhere.\u0027Going forward, I wasn\u0027t sure if I wanted to date someone who had children, but Paul has two.\u0027But actually it\u0027s just perfect. It\u0027s unexpected and that\u0027s what\u0027s so amazing about it.\u0027The couple plan on getting married every year afterwards in a different country around the world as they both love travelling.Sarah said: \u0027We\u0027ll have another wedding next year - maybe in Ibiza, England or New Zealand.\u0027I\u0027ll wear a different dress, but I\u0027ve assured Paul I only need one more ring.\u0027The couple hope to start a family together in the future.Sarah said: \u0027I\u0027m infertile so if and when we have a baby we\u0027ll need to go through IVF treatment.\u0027We may not be lucky enough to have children together, but it won\u0027t matter - we\u0027re enough for each other.\u0027\u0027The only thing I\u0027m worried about is the reaction of my friends and family.\u0027I don\u0027t believe they\u0027re my friends if they\u0027re not supporting me.\u0027Of course, their opinion counts and they care about me and are worried.\u0027But equally they should accept my judgement and be happy for me.\u0027   Mr Edwards said: \u0027My fiance left me four weeks before the wedding so that was £20,000 down the drain and I didn\u0027t get a penny of it back.\u0027It\u0027s taken me quite a while to get back to who I am.\u0027Sarah and I had been discussing marriage, life and what we want for the future.\u0027We both are loving and open and don\u0027t want to allow our past experiences to dictate our future.\u0027But the next day I woke up and sat there for a little while and I thought: \u0027Is this really going to work?\u0027\u0027I started having doubts in my head. I was unsure and anxious about the whole thing.\u0027I messaged Sarah and she told me to call her.\u0027We spoke on the phone and I voiced my concerns. Within 10 minutes she had calmed my anxiety down to the point it disappeared - no one has ever been able to do that before.\u0027We don\u0027t get frustrated with each other, we can keep up with each other.\u0027We have a lot in common and they are the things that matter most.\u0027Our tastes are different - for example, I get most of my clothes from Next and she says it reminds her of her ex and has told me: \u0027You can never buy anything from there again\u0027.\u0027I know she was mostly joking but I really don\u0027t mind - I\u0027m easy going.\u0027When it comes down to little things I\u0027m happy to stand back, but I\u0027m also very highly opinionated if i believe in something strongly.\u0027With every single relationship I\u0027ve had before the element that\u0027s always been missing is communication and the openness.\u0027Now I just think: \u0027What have I actually really got to lose?\u0027\u0027If we have a shotgun wedding and split up in six months, a week, a day - what have I lost in the grand scheme of life? Nothing.\u0027I\u0027ve believed in something and had faith in something. It\u0027s let me just go away from the social norms.\u0027I\u0027ve gone on dates through dating apps and it\u0027s all very nicey-nicey with general chit chat, but there\u0027s no realness in it anymore.\u0027If you look back to second world war type era, in the past, people met once or twice maybe - and wouldn\u0027t be on the phone to each other all the time - and they\u0027d get married and would work hard at it.\u0027If we\u0027re going through a relationship as a married couple we\u0027ll be automatically saying we\u0027ll put as much effort into it as possible.\u0027We are both true believers in marriage and what it means.\u0027She had the idea for us to meet at the airport in our wedding gear. I asked her: \u0027Are you really going to turn up in your wedding dress?\u0027\u0027Sarah said: \u0027Yeah if we\u0027re going to do it, let\u0027s do it properly.\u0027\u0027I did warn her it\u0027s a 10-hour flight and her dress might get a bit crumpled.\u0027All my friends have been really supportive because they\u0027ve seen me at my lowest point and now they see me back to my normal self in such a short space of time and they are happy for me.\u0027They have said: \u0027You are absolutely nuts, but we love you and we want you to be happy. She sounds amazing and we can\u0027t wait to meet her.\u0027\u0027No body has been negative at all in any way, shape or form on my side - I\u0027ve got the best friends that a person could ask for.\u0027I\u0027ve got two daughters - I\u0027m going to see them tomorrow to take them for lunch - and I\u0027ll tell them and ask their opinion.\u0027I know them and I know they\u0027ll be happy for me.\u0027For both Sarah and I, this is the complete opposite of what we\u0027ve both imagined for ourselves.\u0027She told me: \u0027If I read your profile properly and saw you had kids I would have swiped the other way\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s tiny little things like that which make it all the more incredible.\u0027I believe everything happens for a reason.\u0027It\u0027s a one-in-a-lifetime thing. It\u0027s very rare. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve heard of any other couple doing things like this.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Turkey masses tanks Syrian border prepares leave","story":"    Turkish tanks and armoured troop carriers have begun massing on the Syrian border in preparation to move in once American troops have withdrawn          Turkey has agreed to take over the fight against ISIS once the US has left, but will likely also direct its forces against the American-backed Kurds, which it views as terroristsBut Turkey is also likely to direct its attacks against Kurdish forces stationed in northern Syria which helped US troops in the battle against ISIS. Turkey has carried out limited attacks against Kurdish positions in Afrin province, and has vowed to expand its operations to cover its entire southern border.Israel launches Christmas Day airstrikes on Damascus as...Outgoing Defense Secretary Mattis shows up President with...Share this article    Tanks and military vehicles are pictured in the Turkish border town of al-Rai on Christmas Day as they prepare to move into Syria          Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan had vowed to delay a military push into Syria as the Americans left, but his foreign minister has indicated otherwiseTrump\u0027s shock announcement has caused concern in Washington and prompted the resignation of Secretary of Defense James Mattis.As he submitted his letter of resignation to Trump on December 26, Mattis issued a videotaped Christmas message to all American servicemen and women.In it, he said: \u0027Since Washington crossed the Delaware at Christmas in 1776, American troops have missed holidays at home to defend our experiment in democracy.\u0027To all you lads and lasses holding the line in 2018 on land, at sea or in the air, thanks for keeping the faith.

Rather, it is a celebration of those who write well about alcoholic drinks. I write about alcohol for a living. My latest book, The Home Bar, is a guide to setting up your domestic refreshments but it is also about booze history and culture. With drink, and especially wine, it’s easy to write in a technical way and leave out what makes alcohol interesting for most people: its intoxicating properties. Most drink-soaked fiction – by Graham Greene, Patrick Hamilton and others – ignores the nerdy stuff. It is the intersection between connoisseurship and drunkenness that interests me.I return to the following books again and again for inspiration and amusement. I am sure readers will vehemently disagree with some of my omissions. 1. A Long Finish by Michael DibdinDrink is the lubricant of many crime novels. I could have included work by Chandler or Simenon, but instead I’ve chosen one that revolves around wine. A Long Finish focuses on a grudge between two families of vignerons in Piedmont, and it includes great descriptions of the uncompromising wines of Barbaresco. Wine also represents the faultlines in Italian society the conflict between the families stems from in which side each family took during the second world war. Nobody writes about Italy’s dark underbelly better than Dibdin, and his detective, Aurelio Zen, enjoys the long alcoholic soak as much as Philip Marlowe or Maigret.2. Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn WaughBrideshead is neither Waugh’s best book (I favour the Sword of Honour trilogy), nor his funniest (Scoop or The Loved One), but it is the best from a booze point of view. The scenes of drunkenness between Sebastian Flyte and Charles Ryder include some of the funniest parodies of wine talk: “a little, shy wine like a gazelle”. There’s also the excellent cognac-off between Rex Mottram and Ryder, which is a masterclass in razor-sharp snobbery.3. Casino Royale by Ian FlemingNo apologies for including such an obvious choice. So useful have the Bond novels been to drink writers and the drinks industry that there should be statues of James Bond (preferably as Roger Moore in a safari suit) outside Diageo HQ and Bollinger. I’ve picked Casino Royale as it has given us a cocktail, the Vesper martini: made with “three measures of Gordon’s gin, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice cold.” It is especially good made with a decent Polish potato vodka.4. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest HemingwayJust as Bond is associated with the dry martini, so Hemingway is with the daiquiri. I’ve chosen A Farewell to Arms for its sheer variety of alcoholic beverages. Though it is set during the first world war, there’s an optimism about all the cheery Italian drinks it mentions: Campari, Cinzano, marsala – the book could have been funded by the vermouth marketing board. There’s also some decidedly Bond-esque connoisseurship: “The best kummel comes in those bear-shaped bottles. It comes from Russia.”5. A Debt to Pleasure by John LanchesterLanchester’s debut novel is a cookbook-diary of Englishman Tarquin Winot, whose relatives and acquaintances die with alarming frequency. A love letter to the ultimate gastronomic civilisation – France – this book contains recipes, mouth-watering descriptions of meals and plenty about booze – including the perfect martini (seven parts Beefeater gin to one Noilly Prat) and an unbeatable description of one of my favourite reds, Chinon, that is so spot on you can almost taste it: “both playful and fruity in some moods, darker and even a touch forbidding in others…”6. Between Meals: An Appetite for Paris by AJ LieblingPublished in 1959, this is an account of Liebling’s time in Paris in the 20s. Like Lanchester’s novel, it is a hymn to the pleasures of French gastronomy. Indeed, Liebling paid a heavy debt to pleasure in the form of gout so severe he could barely walk. There are paeans to France’s liquid treasures: burgundy, beaujolais, cognac, and, most memorably, to the greatest rosé of all, tavel from southern Rhône: “The taste is warm but dry, like an enthusiasm held under restraint, and there is a tantalising suspicion of bitterness when the wine hits the top of the palate.”7. I Drink Therefore I Am: A Philosopher’s Guide to Wine by Roger ScrutonThis book is ostensibly about wine and philosophy, but Scruton also writes movingly about his relationship with his father, and his political and spiritual awakening in Paris in 1968. Scruton isn’t interested in grape varieties and types of barrel instead he looks at wine’s cultural and religious roots, and acknowledges its transformative power.8. The Hour: A Cocktail Manifesto by Bernard DeVotoThe Pulitzer-winning historian wrote this mock heroic about the joys of the cocktail hour in 1948. He grasped that the job of a drink writer is not necessarily to be right, but to take a strong stance on unimportant things. DeVoto forbade all cocktails except the martini (his perfect ratio is 3.7 parts gin to one part vermouth) and the old fashioned. The Hour is enormously fun and endlessly quotable: “You can no more keep a martini in the refrigerator than you can keep a kiss in there.” Just don’t treat it as a guide to making cocktails.9. Everyday Drinking by Kingsley AmisThis collection of Amis’s writings about drinks is a mixed bag. He isn’t very interested in wine but when it comes to spirits, he’s your man. Amis even has his own cocktail, The Lucky Jim: 12 parts vodka, one part Martini Rosso, two parts lemon juice. The best chapter is the one on “boozemanship”, which is “the art or science of coming ahead in drinking matters”. It is Amis’s very funny take on gamesmanship, and includes the perfect way to deal with a wine bore.10. Adventures on the Wine Route by Kermit LynchKermit Lynch has a lesson for all writers on drink: “Wine is, above all, pleasure. Those who would make it ponderous make it dull.” The 1988 book is powered by Lynch’s anger at producers cutting corners and abandoning time-honoured methods to make their wine more modern. It’s also very funny – take his writing about blind tasting: “When a woman chooses a hat, she does not put it on a goat’s head to judge it she puts it on her own.” Difficult to argue with that.• The Home Bar: A Guide to Designing, Equipping and Stocking Your Own Bar by Henry Jeffreys is published by Jacqui Small, priced £25.

You are led into them briskly, without any caveat, and so you expect a degree of familiarity. But things are never as they seem. In the collection A Manual for Cleaning Women, a dentist has only one chaise longue in his waiting room: patients usually sit on window sills or radiators – “On the ceiling was a sign, WHAT THE HELL YOU LOOKING UP HERE FOR?” A laundry floor is flooded. Water from a toilet upstairs drips through the chandelier in a New York apartment. A lonely man in Montana pastes old newspapers on his cabin walls, so that in the winter he can “read his walls, page by page”. It isn’t just the rooms the people in them, too, seem out of sorts. A girl decides to do nothing as her pampered younger sister is molested by their grandfather. An addict in rehab kills a pack of stray dogs. A hospital employee can’t stand the way certain suffering women look: “God forgive me, because I am a woman too, but when I see women with that look, I want to slap them.”The Berlin revival is welcome but curious. The publication of A Manual for Cleaning Women in 2015 gave her work attention that was overdue, but in the process she was categorised as a Carver-like chronicler of small-town US life – a writer of quiet, poignant but provincial stories. This overlooks the ways in which Berlin’s fiction subtly complicates what it meant to be an American in the latter half of the last century. Her background was very different from the minimalists she is now inevitably grouped with.In Welcome Home, a new selection of her letters and autobiographical fragments, Berlin describes her time growing up in mining towns in the US her scoliosis, diagnosed when she was just 10 three marriages and four children before she was 30 the jobs she had to take on as a single mother to finance her addiction and medical bills. She spent her teenage years in Chile lived for years with her third husband and children in rural Mexico was a fixture in the Manhattan poetry scene with Denise Levertov and Amiri Baraka and late in life became was a popular creative writing professor in Colorado.The stories in Evening in Paradise, Berlin’s second posthumous collection, are filled again with shabby rooms and shabbier lives. A woman in Texas spends Christmas sitting on her roof. Children during the second world war sell sweepstakes from door to door. An old adobe house in New Mexico has no electricity or water: “Field mice came through all the holes … drilled for the plumbing.” In “Andado: A Gothic Romance” a Chilean senator pursues his American friend’s teenage daughter. He takes her to his country estate one weekend and they read Turgenev’s First Love by firelight. But, after the affair, it is the older man who seems guileless – “I am trying to think about what I have done” – while the girl only wants to be kissed again.The opening of the title story, which centres on Hernan, a bartender, enacts this elusiveness: “Sometimes years later you look back and say that was the beginning of … or we were so happy then … before … after … Or you think I’ll be happy when … once I get … if we … Hernan knew he was happy now.” The longing concealed in these ellipses doesn’t seem Hernan’s. He is not much of a brooder or philosopher – just “happy now”. You suspect the thoughts are Berlin’s, and she is setting the mood in her understated way, just as a singer might preface a song with some reflective chatter. Music is a defining influence for Berlin – it is there in the whispered lullabies, the drunken singing, the crack-addled pianists. Places are evoked with an itinerant regret that sooner or later one will be again on the road. Texas, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico, New York: the US of her stories is also the one conjured by mid-century country music and blues, a land at once exotic and wholesome, bustling with one-street towns and crowded cities, but no suburbia.Why did it take so long for her books to find a sizable readership? The letters published in Welcome Home provide some partial answers. Encouraged by the poet Edward Dorn, Berlin was already writing seriously as an undergraduate. By the time she was 24, she had an agent, and was published in Saul Bellow’s magazine, the Noble Savage. In 1960, Little, Brown offered money to option a prospective novel. Berlin was overwhelmed: “It is no help to be paid for something that hasn’t been read.” Her agent kept goading her to sign: “Put your face on the book jacket and you’ll sell a million copies.” It all culminated in a dreadful lunch in a New York hotel, at which the editor at the publishing house sheepishly admitted that she was offering the deal just to placate Berlin’s powerful agent.Though she won an American Book award in the 1990s, Berlin’s books were brought out in her lifetime only by small local presses. This seems all the more a wasted opportunity given the extent to which her stories, no doubt because all of that lived experience, open out to the world. An American girl realises the enormous power she wields over her high-school teachers in Chile pregnant women cross the border from Texas into Mexico to get abortions a white woman befriends an Apache chief while doing laundry in New Mexico a bored New York housewife starts stalking the neighbourhood postman on his rounds – this is far from the stifling mood of Carver, even Cheever. There is no wallowing, no bathos. Instead there is an acute and varied awareness of the meaning of America, both at home and in the world. • Welcome Home and Evening in Paradise by Lucia Berlin are published by Picador.

One counterargument is that the country is hopelessly ided anyway and that quitting the EU with a Brexit deal that pleases almost nobody is a recipe for further bitterness.This counterargument is fair enough, as far as it goes. But pro-Europeans also need to show that we have learned lessons from the past three years and that a new referendum can help heal our country.What we need is a process, where we are frank about our options and commit as a society to address the legitimate reasons that led people to vote for Brexit in the first place.This has to begin with an honest debate in parliament. If MPs reject the prime minister’s deal when they return from their Christmas break, as they should, they need to determine urgently whether there are any good alternatives.The time for unicorns is over. MPs must now deal in concrete realities – and see if any viable forms of Brexit have majority support. The chances are that they won’t because the only real alternatives to the prime minister’s deal are to crash out with no deal at all, or to accept full membership of the EU’s single market along with free movement of people.This discovery process will be valuable because parliament will end up with a clearer idea of what is possible. If alternative forms of Brexit have been explored and found wanting, the case for asking the people will have even greater legitimacy than it does today.A people’s vote in 2019 would be very different from the 2016 referendum. Then, voters were promised a fantasy Brexit. A new referendum would be a choice between the reality of staying in and the reality of leaving.It would be naive to suppose that a new vote would be entirely honest. The temptation to distort facts, make unrealistic promises and even lie is always present in politics. But the scope to do so may be limited by the fact that the public has been inoculated by the dishonesty of the 2016 campaign – where, it has to be admitted, the remain camp also spun the truth, though it did not descend to the depths of the leave camp.A people’s vote would also be hard fought. After all, so much is at stake. But we must all try to treat the other side with respect, as the Queen rightly said in her Christmas Day broadcast. Voters are so fed up with bullying politicians that they may punish those who don’t behave with respect – and politicians, fearing that, should behave better.An honest debate in both parliament and a future referendum will not be enough to heal our country. We must also acknowledge that the status quo is not acceptable to many people – and that their legitimate concerns must be addressed.Many people are living in communities with proud histories that have been battered by de-industrialisation and decades of neglect. Our public services have been starved of investment. And we have not done enough to integrate migrants in our society.These are not the only reasons people voted to leave the EU – and public spending isn’t the only answer. But these problems are crying out for attention, whatever happens on Brexit.The snag is that, if we quit the EU, we will have less money to spend because the economy will be damaged. What’s more, the debate over Brexit will go on for years – because the orce deal will not spell out our future relationship with the EU – and our politicians will have no time to think about anything else.By contrast, if we stay in the EU, MPs will be able to focus on healing our country rather than worrying about Brexit. There will also be a mega-idend probably worth tens of billions of pounds a year that could be invested in doing just that, according to a report by CommonGround published earlier this month.The report suggests three ideas for spending this idend: a jumpstart fund for parts of the country that have been starved of investment a cash infusion for the NHS, above and beyond what the prime minister has promised and a migration and communities fund for areas that have been challenged by sudden or significant population changes.These are only one set of ideas. Other people will have their own views about what to do. But there is a growing consensus in both civil society and among politicians from different parties that we need to do something along these lines.What we need now is a national debate about how to heal our country and the political will to follow through with action.

I love his self-knowledge. I love the poetry of The Communist Manifesto. I love that he was a seer, a prophet of what we now call globalisation. I love that he understood that there is no sphere of our lives, public or private, into which capital does not weave its way, that there can be no compromises. He is the great thinker of our times, but over the past couple of years I have changed my mind about whether he is the most important one.If I want to read someone whose work truly explains what is happening now, and who is unsettling and properly radical, it is Sigmund Freud I turn to. It is his work that often explains things I would rather not know but recognise happening around me. I haven’t given up on Karl but Siggy strikes me as the man of the hour, the thinker who underpins how we see ourselves. You don’t read Freud for reassurance, but if you want something profound and dazzling, he’s the man.To read Freud is to begin to see how the conception of what it is to be a modern person came about. Modernity, if it means anything, means a certain understanding of the process by which we make ourselves who we are: self-reflection. For Marx, reflection leads to inevitably antagonistic class relations. But the working class is a continual disappointment to the left for failing to recognise itself as a class, or to do as it is told. This, we are told, is the fault lately of the mainstream media, the BBC and centrist politicians, but it is in fact a global phenomenon. Freud actually understood that it is part of being human to crave authority. He saw rationality as a veneer underneath we are a mass of drives and contradictions. We are unknowable to ourselves, unbiddable even. Sure, Freud had his faults – a chancer trying to raise a growing family in turn-of-the-century Vienna, inventing a science that was based on conversations between men about the lives of women – but look at what he taught us. Narcissism. Repression. Nostalgia. How patriarchal laws are passed unconsciously.Look at our current politics, now based on “taking back control”. Freud warned that nostalgia was a yearning for something that had never been, a melancholia. As a Jew, his account of childhood is like that of any outsider needing to assimilate. Feminism is also a movement about not being allowed, or being unwilling, to assimilate into a patriarchal society. Anyone who reads Freud’s famous case study Dora will see a young woman who would not play the game, who refused to be an object of exchange between powerful men, who found a voice. She is a precursor of the #MeToo movement.It is Freud who gives voice to things we would rather not like to think about: infantile sexuality, perversion, fetishisation, and the violence of love.For all his blind spots – he did not see the rising antisemitism around him, instead fearing he would be brought down by the Catholic church – Freud was able to look around at bourgeois society and say: what you think is rational is dependent on drives you are not fully in control of. He says that women may indeed envy the power, if not the penises, of men.He said that dreams matter, mistakes matter, that everything matters.Remain supporters and some US Democrats operate with the simplistic Marxist notion of false consciousness. This states that if only people get the right facts, they will think the right things. Momentum wants to wake people up to some true vision of socialism, too often feeding another craving for authority, just of a kinder, greyer sort. Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps?Emotions are at the base of this, not simply class positions. Freud understood this, that what we let be conscious is complex. He turns us inside out. When I have met politicians, I have often thought of them as the least self-aware people I have met. Isn’t it part of being a good leader to examine one’s own drives, ego, everyday neuroses, one’s ability to change, so as not to repeat patterns of the past, or at least to recognise them? No. Clearly not.Freud as a self-help guru killed Freud the revolutionary. But he is a revolutionary, and let’s get him back as one. I have changed my mind about him because he changes minds. We live in an age where the repressed have returned. And it’s dark, dark stuff. If you want a new politics, then examine and change your own mind. That’s where it starts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceab97f3a169753d83473919a17c6667302596cd/0_128_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1429e56f24ff05c9a19f49a18330a3c2","title":"scrap parliamentary lobby westminster journalists","story":"Westminster is full of brilliant journalists but the shadowy briefing system that guides them should be more transparentIt’s traditional at the end of the year to look back on what’s happened and what we’ve done – and what we might do differently next year. For those of us in politics or the media, after a year as frenetic and isive as 2018 this becomes a serious duty.So here is a proposal for how we might do better in 2019: let’s scrap the lobby system of political journalism entirely. This is not – despite what Twitter commentators might think – because lobby journalists are biased, untalented, or lazy. Far from it: some of the most talented, ambitious and diligent reporters in the UK work from the lobby, and it’s the home to journalists used to netting page one, or the top of the bulletin.It’s a shame that they’re wasted in the lobby, a system which by design separates politics from policy, and separates politicians from the consequences of their actions.The problems start with the physical location of political journalists, who work from their own offices in the Palace of Westminster, rather than from their own newsrooms.Lobby journalists can know each other better than they know journalists in their own newsroom, reinforcing the instinct to focus on politics – who’s up, who’s down – rather than policy itself, and can also encourage hacks to run in a pack, checking news lines with one another.It also clearly leads to lobby journalists being highly likely to count some of the politicians and advisers they mix with as friends. This is absolutely natural and happens across journalism, but nonetheless the institution undeniably encourages a cosiness that may not serve the public as well as it could.Bigger problems come from the workings of the lobby – a sort-of-on-the-record morning briefing, an off-the-record afternoon huddle, and the endless language of “sources in”, “friends of”, “people familiar with”, and more.It is common practice for the leader of the opposition’s office, for example, to have its official spokesman respond to a press query on background – allowing their response to be written into the article in veiled terms, but leaving no actual statement, giving the impression to some that no opportunity was given to comment.This news management gets worse on the government side: policies can be “leaked” – in practice officially released, but presented as being from “sources” or similar – late in the day to a lobby journalist, who will inevitably push for page one.The timing, and the understandable desire for a journalist to own their scoop, keeps journalists with policy expertise away from the story, meaning it will often follow the government line – especially if it’s given on a “no approach” basis, meaning outside experts can’t be contacted before publication.The biggest problem, though, is that by and large lobby journalists are the only reporters senior politicians will talk to. Many of the biggest stories require months of research for a reporter to really know the facts, the details, and the lives of people affected.The reporter who has done that work, though, is often not the one who can challenge a minister on it. And even a well-intentioned lobby journalist will likely only get a briefing lasting 10 to 15 minutes from their colleague on what to ask: and the journalist sitting with the minister will not be the same one who sat down with the mother unable to feed herself or her family because of the failings of universal credit.The beneficiary from this distance isn’t the media, and it certainly isn’t the public: it is people in positions of power, who manage to co-opt a system designed to hold them to account into another layer insulating them from scrutiny.Parliament and its procedures are immensely complex and we will always need some reporters to specialise in it. We should also note there is no shortage of journalists within the lobby doing their best for accountability within a system designed to stymie them.The institution of the lobby is painfully out of date: it could never be created in its current form in the modern day. Few in the country will feel nostalgic for it – and if just a few outlets stopped playing along (as has been tried before) in the internet era, others would soon have to follow.

Hoa Hakananai’a, as it is known, meaning “lost or stolen friend”, is a looming and powerful presence. On its back it bears a carving of a winged figure, witness to the complex history of the object – over time the religion of the islanders changed, and they began to honour “birdmen” instead of the great carved ancestor figures.Later, Hoa Hakananai’a was collected, under circumstances that the British Museum website does not make entirely plain, by Richard Ashmore Powell, commander of the British navy frigate HMS Topaze. It was then given to Queen Victoria, from whom it came to the museum. This autumn, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, the governor of Rapa Nui, made a tearful request for the sculpture’s return. “We are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul,” she said. What was less publicised was the fact that the governor was there at the invitation of the British Museum and that meetings will continue in 2019 in Rapa Nui.Such stories appear regularly in the press, and always have done. Indeed, the history of imperial powers helping themselves by fair means or foul to precious artefacts goes back at least to the Roman empire. Greece’s temples were stripped of their ritual objects by their Roman conquerors. Transferred to the villas of the wealthy, these sculptures became aestheticised into something else: “art”, the status symbols of collectors.Such news stories will arrive with ever more intensity in 2019 and the years to come. Calls to restitute cultural property, like calls to topple Rhodes, decolonise university curricula, or stop cultural appropriation, are part of a wider societal trend that can be placed under the heading of identity politics. And, like identity politics, demands for restitution are not going away. Both for ethical and pragmatic reasons, they must be taken seriously.The debate about cultural restitution has been stirred up in the past month by a report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as the direct result of a speech he made last year in Ouagadougou declaring that the restitution of African heritage to Africa would be a “top priority”. The radical and forthright report, by the scholars Bénédicte Savoy and Felwine Sarr, has had a mixed response. Some have welcomed the authors’ conclusion that all objects collected under colonial conditions ought to be restored unless evidence can be provided that they were collected legitimately – reversing the burden of proof so that it is borne by the former colonial power rather than the former colonies. Many have applauded the clarity with which Professor Savoy and Professor Sarr have described the long-term effects of the appropriation of artefacts. The removal of cultural property not only affects the generation from whom it is taken, they write, “it becomes inscribed throughout the long duration of societies, conditioning the flourishing of certain societies while simultaneously continuing to weaken others”.The report has received a less hearty welcome among the museum directors of northern Europe, however. Some point out that it was commissioned not from a sense of responsibility by Mr Macron but as a means of furthering his nation’s interests in sub-Saharan Africa (the report, indeed, limits itself to that region, excluding former French colonies in north Africa and elsewhere). Others say that the blanket assertion that any and all acquisitions for museums made under colonial conditions are wrong is a gross simplification. Items entered museum collections for all kinds of reasons, they argue. These range from cases of obvious looting (as in the example of the Benin bronzes taken in the 1890s by European troops from the royal palace in Benin City) to items that were perfectly legitimately traded, or indeed freely given. They say that the report gives little or no attention to the real-world, on-the-ground cooperation between museum professionals in northern Europe and their colleagues in other parts of the world.All of this is sensible. At worst, however, western museum professionals can convey the notion – even if it is not uttered out loud – that objects are somehow “better off” in Paris, London or Berlin than elsewhere, where they can, according to this unspoken assumption, be properly cared for and admired. It is unhelpful that major museum directors in this context remain almost invariably white men of similar background and education – an “all-male choir”, as one African commentator has put it.Disputes over cultural property cannot be seen in isolation. They must be taken together with an understanding that the imperial past is not dead but is a set of narratives that are still alive, still unresolved, and still bringing real-world consequences. In the end, resolving ownership of artefacts is one part of a broader project: that of former imperial powers finding the language to deal properly with the dark periods of their history. In Britain, this work is urgent, and it has barely begun.There is no point pretending that there are simple blanket rules, or simple possible answers. It is a meaningless absurdity to suggest that all objects held in museums should be returned to their point of origin in most cases it would be impossible as well as undesirable (think of those Greek sculptures acquired by Roman conquerors now in Italian museums). To suggest that none may go is equally absurd: there are thousands of objects scattered through Britain alone, and very few are subject to restitution claims – there is no immediate danger of après moi le déluge. Equally, this is not a question only for national museums but significantly, in Britain, for regional collections and university museums such as Glasgow’s Hunterian and Oxford’s Pitt Rivers.There can be no resolution without knowledge. This is not glamorous, nor is it cheap it is the slow, arduous work of provenance research, and museums must be equipped and resourced to undertake it. History, memory and dignity must to be restored to artefacts. Better, deeper stories need to be told to the public the archive needs to be enriched. Where items are found to have been acquired wrongfully, restitution must follow. Museums lie at the root of these difficult and painful disputes over memory they are also the places best able, in the end, to resolve them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66366dfbe06906cba05a65f881e21769d2a935da/0_322_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8899828e3298517071813319e67dce6e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of festive","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘festive’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘festive’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what festive means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 December at 10am.

A blue plaque already exists there, which means, Best argues, a duplicate is not needed in London.“The thing with Gertrude Bell is that everyone is trying to appropriate her as a person. She is deeply misunderstood.”Best said Bell was a complex character and does not easily fit into defined narratives. She was born in 1868, in Washington, to a staggeringly wealthy northern family who made its fortune in iron.Her extraordinary life and achievements have become known through her diaries, letters and books. Bell was a traveller, writer, linguist and archaeologist who, in her day, was as well known as her friend TE Lawrence, if not better known.She did so much it is sometimes difficult to pick out the greatest and more eye-catching achievements of her life.It could be the important role she played in the establishment of the state known as Mesopotamia, now Iraq, after the first world war. Or her being one of the first archaeologists to examine the Byzantine remains of Anatolian Turkey.Or the 53 hours she survived on a rope during a blizzard on the previously unclimbed north-east face of the Finsteraarhorn in the Swiss Alps in 1902.Best argues that Bell’s greatest creative achievements were her translations of the Persian poet Hafez.But there are also many uncomfortable truths in Bell’s life that have been swept under the carpet, Best argues, including her fervent opposition to women getting the vote. Bell was secretary of the northern branch of National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage as well as being on its national executive committee.Bell’s remarkable life was the subject of the 2015 Werner Herzog film, Queen of the Desert, starring Nicole Kidman. Best is scathing about the film, which was a commercial and critical flop. “Queen of the desert? She would have completely hated that. It was everything that she didn’t want to be.“The thing is everyone is trying to grab hold of Gertrude Bell and say yes, she’s one of us. But she’s not.”Best published his book, Bezique, the Private Life of Gertrude Lowthian Bell, in the summer ahead of the 150th anniversary of Bell’s birth on 14 July.English Heritage is still seeking permissions from building owners for the London plaque for Bell but it has been approved by its panel of experts and is expected to happen in 2019.In a statement English Heritage said the blue plaque scheme was designed to celebrate notable people and their connections to London buildings and commemorated many who have lived in other parts of the country and other countries.Bell, the charity said, was a figure of international renown and is commemorated in various locations across England and as far afield as Iraq.Howard Spencer, senior historian at English Heritage, said: “When considering anyone for a blue plaque, English Heritage undertakes extensive research on that person’s achievements and their connections with London buildings. This is then reviewed by the independent experts who make up the blue plaques panel.“In the case of Bell, the London address selected was a family home where she stayed regularly, and with which she was associated for over 40 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3d25447efc931930ed6e2793b4fca7ce83445a/0_241_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98a9cbdee620fd014c59931d80d7c60","title":"feel like big rich baby my week comfort dressing","story":"Comfort is in fashion, with kimonos on the catwalk and cashmere jogging bottoms on the high street. But is it ever OK to wear your nightie to work?The designer Yves Saint Laurent once said that dressing is a way of life. In his view, clothes are not a mere accessory to life’s key moments, but integral to the moment itself. Fashion, then, is not just a hobby, but a methodology for living well. What Saint Laurent never made clear was whether this methodology can be applied to an ordinary, less fashionable life, where the best moments regularly include ordering a pizza from bed or hangover-crying to episodes of the Antiques Roadshow. But luckily, contemporary fashion has this covered with the current trend for comfort dressing.Broadly speaking, comfort clothes are the kind of thing that you already own. Think of the old jogging bottoms you wear around the house and might even pop to the corner shop in the stretched, bobbly jumper that your relatives mock but you can’t live without the oversized T-shirt you might lazily wear to your local but then fall face first into bed without removing. You have probably owned this style of clothing your whole life, but what is new is wearing it outside – and not just as a quiet trick you play hoping no one notices, but loud and proud. You’re comfy, and you want everyone to know about it.It is the logical next step of a sartorial period in which streetwear and sportswear fused to become “athleisure”, where going from the gym to anywhere was stylish. Now replace gym with “sofa” or “bed” and you’ve summed up this latest style iteration.There is more to say about this fashion moment. Could the prioritising of women’s comfort be described as feminist? Or is it simply the result of a dystopian tech nightmare, where so much of our life is lived online that “innerwear” – clothes for wearing in private – are now our de facto uniforms?Although I quite like the idea of everyone wearing their most relaxed clothes out in public with pride, the real test would be whether it is genuinely comfortable wearing pyjamas out in public or not, so I decided to find out.In theory, to achieve this look you can just wear items you feel happy hanging around your living room in. But in practice, comfort is a specific trend, and does not stretch to animal-print onesies or embarrassing tourist T-shirts. After consulting the ’s fashion desk, I get hold of an Asos pyjama-style shirt, along with a pair of Marks \u0026amp Spencer grey cashmere jogging bottoms and a jumper in the same shade. From my own wardrobe, I pick out a vintage oversized Mickey Mouse nightie a Japanese-inspired kimono gown and a pair of wide-leg plain black pyjama bottoms. I also want to find an oversized Lenny Kravitz-style blanket scarf, but settle on an actual blanket that previously belonged to my cat.On the first day of the experiment, I go with the nightie-kimono combo teamed with my baggiest, comfiest jeans and trainers. When I was first asked to write this article, I thought it would be a breeze. I am someone who does not know the meaning of dressing up: I am devoutly casual, and have been a fan of sportswear since my teenage years. But when I get to the door to leave my house, and the thought of being on the bus in my nightie becomes real, I chicken out. It feels wrong, which I realise is because I’d worn said nightie and gown as they were intended – as actual pyjamas – the night before. This is too extreme for even the most faithful of comfort-trend disciples: these clothes aren’t clean. Shoving them in the wash, I pop on the grey jumper and trouser combo that are so close in shade they look like a two-piece. It’s not every day you get to cover yourself top to toe in cashmere, and the close, sleepsuit fit makes me feel like a big rich baby. I love it.When I was growing up on an east London estate where people did genuinely wear their pyjamas outside, I was told that to get ahead I should dress smartly. It would incense me that at university, the posh kids could slip around in joggers, whereas if I did I’d bring myself to the attention of security staff at Boots. Yet, in my cashmere babygro, I don’t feel especially visible, just comfortable. There is safety in numbers, and I suppose as enough people are dressing this way, I needn’t worry as much.I am, however, much more visible at work. Not in a disciplinary way, more in an envious way. “You just look so comfy,” says a colleague as I walk past. “It feels so soft,” says another, stroking my arm. It is unclear if the clothes make me feel like it is a particularly relaxing day or if it actually is, but I am so chilled out that I fall asleep on the train home from work. Later, when I am lounging around my house, I am struck by how hot the outfit is. I become irritated and pull it off.The next morning, I put on my (now clean) nightie and kimono and head back to work. It is cold, so I keep the gown closed and enjoy the feel of silk against my skin. It is luxurious and genteel: I feel I could also wear a cravat and smoke a pipe.No one on the tube bats an eyelid. I receive no judgmental glances. No one mentions anything at the office, either. Eventually, after a bit of prompting, a colleague says: “Those jackets are in shops now. It just looks like one of those.” Fine.I turn it up a notch, undoing the gown to reveal Mickey as a wizard I am walking past desks slowly, flapping my kimono around in the hope that someone will notice. I ask someone’s opinion of my nightdress. “I don’t know. Looks retro. Just assumed it was some hipster, trendy thing.” This, I realise, is why my experiment may not produce substantial results. As a millennial working in the media, who already dresses informally, I am able to get away with a lot under a presumption of fashion. The real test would be someone with a smarter work dress code.The next day, I try out the black pyjama-style shirt – that is, a shirt with the trims of a silk pyjama top (piping around the collar and pocket). This design is made from a material that is closer to a suit jacket and would definitely not be worn to bed. Paired with my black pyjama bottoms, on first glance it does look like a set, but technically speaking could be worn to an important meeting. Again, no one says anything, but I notice a few curious glances. When quizzed, the only noteworthy comment is: “Isn’t wearing makeup cheating? I thought the look was straight out of bed?”For my final outfit, I want to test out the oversized blanket scarf (read: actual blanket). To give it the space it needs to be star of the show, I opt for the black pyjama bottoms and a black hoodie. The first thing to say is that wearing a blanket as a scarf – keeping it bunched up around the neck and shoulders – is actually pretty tough. You have to twist it up before it goes on and spend some time shaping it to get that just-thrown-on look. I wear it to Christmas drinks with friends, and aside from slowly dehydrating under all the layers, feel the confidence of a fashion insider. And at the cold bus stop, I am grateful for the full-bodied scarf. Why this has taken so long to catch on is beyond me.Saying that, it is a relief to be back to normal the next day, and I’m not sure if I will be wearing my comfort clothes to work again any time soon. It strikes me as a little pointless to change out of one pair of pyjamas into another, particularly if they are designed to look more comfortable than they actually are.The experiment has certainly made me think about the concept of comfort itself. To some, comfort is the feel of a certain material on the skin for others, comfort it is about invisibility and for others still, it is about being seen. I’m not sure which version is for me and suspect it changes daily depending on what sort of mood I am in.But mostly, it has made me think about how you can wear almost anything and be guaranteed a polite smile. “Back in your civvies, I see,” says my colleague who had previously claimed not to have noticed. “Shame, I was just getting used to that.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour. But we collectively fear work Christmas parties and being invited to Christmas dinner at other people’s houses. What if they make us put on the hats?Combining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

From a sharing platter to an indulgent main course, here are three Boursin-inspired dishes you can pull together before the doorbell ringsWhether you’re hosting an impromptu drinks party or a last-minute family get-together, Boursin cheese makes a deliciously versatile addition to any festive menu, especially when you’re pressed for time …2 x 150g Boursin (any flavour)300ml light creme fraicheOlive oil2 packs Parma ham14 grissini breadsticks1 head red chicory, leaves separated150g baby carrots, peeled4 celery sticks, peeled and sliced into matchsticks1 bunch breakfast radishes, trimmed8 baby courgettes, sliced lengthwaysA sharing platter is ideal for last-minute parties. Make your centrepiece a luxurious dip: whisk Boursin with creme fraiche, salt and pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with artisan bread, salad and your choice of crudites, such as radishes, baby courgettes and grissini wrapped with Parma ham slices. Leftover dip? Spread on bagels and top with smoked salmon for an indulgent festive brunch.500g baby spinach, washed½ tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, mincedSalt and ground black pepper150g Boursin garlic and herbs1 egg75g fine breadcrumbs100g parmesan, finely grated50g butter, melted, or good quality olive oilSmall handful sage leavesOlive oil, for fryingGnudi are Italian-style dumplings made with ricotta cheese. This version is packed with flavour and can be pulled off in just 30 minutes. Dressed with butter, parmesan and crispy sage leaves, this is main course material, but it could easily be halved and served as a starter.To prepare, put the spinach in a large saucepan and pour over a kettle full of boiling water. Allow the spinach to wilt for 3 minutes, then drain. Press the spinach in a colander set over the sink, squeezing out the water. Once dry, roughly chop.Put the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the garlic, cooking for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the spinach with a generous amount of salt and black pepper, and cook for a further 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.In a large bowl, mix the Boursin with the egg. Add the spinach, stirring to combine, then add three-quarters of the breadcrumbs and mix well. Check the consistency – if it feels a little loose or sticky, add the rest of the breadcrumbs.Using your hands, shape the mix into pieces the size of ping-pong balls and put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper. Refrigerate while you fry the sage.In a small saucepan, heat 2cm of oil until shimmering. Add the sage leaves, frying for 30 seconds, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, then add the gnudi – you will need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until they float to the top. Remove from the water.Divide the gnudi between four plates, drizzle with the melted butter, scatter with the parmesan, sprinkle over the sage leaves, and finish with some black pepper.2 thick-cut pork loin chops1 lemon, halved2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves pickedSalt and ground black pepperOlive oilFor the gratin:25g butter2 banana shallots, dicedSalt and ground black pepper1 garlic clove, halved250ml cream or whole milk150g garlic and herbs Boursin1 medium butternut squash, peeled and very thinly sliced50g gruyere, finely gratedFor something extra special, this wintry main is just the ticket. Here, Boursin has been added to the gratin sauce, creating a rich, savoury foil to the sweetness of the squash. The gratin is so good that it works just as well as a vegetarian main, served with a crisp green salad.To prepare, preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and rub the cut sides of the garlic clove around a medium-sized dish.Put the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and cook the shallots with plenty of seasoning for 5-10 minutes.Whisk together the Boursin and cream, or milk, until smooth, then season to taste.Layer the squash slices and shallots, adding salt and pepper to each layer in the baking dish, then pour over the milk and Boursin mixture, making sure it has seeped into the gaps. Scatter over the cheese, grind over some black pepper and cover with foil, then bake for 45 minutes.Roughly 15 minutes before the 45 minutes is up, prepare the pork. Rub with oil, season well, then, in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, hold the pork chops fat-side down in the pan, cooking for 2-3 minutes until golden. Fry on each side for a minute, until a little browned, then put in a small roasting tray, tucking the lemon and thyme around the chops.After 45 minutes of cooking the gratin, turn the oven up to 200Cgas mark 6. Uncover the squash, put the chops on the top shelf of the oven, then cook alongside the gratin for 15 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown, the squash is tender, and the pork is cooked.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.As the chicken is resting, steam or boil the broccoli, then toss with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Carve the chicken and serve with the broccoli and potatoes.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy, crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

As Angela Hartnett warns, “don’t eat zabaglione and drive – it’s very potent!”Some of us might remember it from a time when it was a staple of the dessert trolley in Italian restaurants lit by chianti candlelight. But, according to Katie Caldesi, zabaglione is an ancient Venetian speciality, with its roots in the warming eggnogs common throughout medieval Europe, “simply flavoured in France and Italy, highly spiced in England”, if Harold McGee is to be believed. Indeed, food writer Giuliano Bugialli claims that zabaglione was “originally served as a tonic, stirred into morning coffee”, which sounds a good way to start the day at this time of year. Alternatively, serve it as a dessert-cum-digestif after dinner – preferably once the kids are safely in bed. A glorious cloud of pure pleasure that you can whip up in less than 10 minutes. Really, why wouldn’t you?Hazan observes in her monumental book, The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, that this may well be the only dessert using whisked egg yolks: “I don’t know of another,” she says. To whip up successfully, the protein-rich yolks need to be mixed with water – here in the form of wine, though you can, I’m assured, substitute coffee, hot chocolate or fruit juice, if you prefer. Then it is heated to set the foam (or, as McGee puts it rather more technically, to encourage the egg proteins to “unfold and bond with each other into a reinforcing matrix”). Caldesi also whisks in a whole egg, which makes her zabaglione gloriously light and foamy – if you’re after a particularly ethereal result, follow her lead, but the richer, yolk-only versions prove the firm favourite among my testers.The oft-quoted ratio of egg to sugar and wine is 1:1:1, using the eggshell as a measure (note: a yolk measures about a tablespoon, and a tablespoon is much easier to clean than an egg shell). But of the recipes I try, only Skye McAlpine’s lovely book, A Table in Venice, conforms: most others go a lot heavier on the alcohol, with Hazan calling for four times as much booze as yolk. The overwhelming feedback from my testers is that many of the recipes are just too sweet, so I’m going to reduce the sugar slightly as well as upping the alcohol, because I feel wine should be the predominant flavour.Caldesi also mentions that honey can be used instead of sugar, if preferred, which I think I’m going to like, but don’t – hot honey has a very strong flavour that we all find rather overpowering. If you’re a fan, however, do feel free to use it instead.That said, sugar is one of the principle flavours in this dish, and it seems a shame to use boring old white caster, so I’m going for the warmer, more caramelised notes of the soft, brown variety, balanced with a tiny pinch of salt, as suggested by Michael Ruhlman in his book Egg.And it works surprisingly well, giving the zabaglione a more savoury, tannic quality that is both intriguing, and rather less fun and frothy than its white wine counterparts, so I’m going to stick with Marsala and, in deference to Hartnett’s Nonna, who would “empty the drinks cabinet” in the process of making the festive zabaglione, sling in a slug of brandy, too. This last is entirely optional (whisky, rum or similar would also work well), but remember, Christmas comes but once a year, and you’ve got the next 11 months to recover.McAlpine describes her method as “slightly unconventional”, though in fact quite a few recipes whisk the yolks and sugar together off the heat before any Cook can take place, and with good reason – particularly daring chefs may be happy to make zabaglione directly in the pan, but I’d recommend a bain marie because, to quote McGee, “the mix thickens at such a low temperature that direct heat can quickly overcook it”.Hazan suggests her red-wine version is best served cold. The danger of this is that the mixture separates (though if it does, it can usually be whisked back together), but we all agree that we prefer zabaglione warm in any case: chilling it dulls the flavour. If you would like to serve it cold, however (and I have some sympathy with Anna Del Conte’s complaint that “zabaglione is lovely, but I do find it very tiresome to have to get up from the table and retire to the kitchen to make it”), I’d recommend whisking in some whipped cream, as she suggests in Amaretto, Apple Cake and Artichokes, to help stabilise the mixture.Either way, zabaglione is very good served over fruit, on a bed of crushed amaretti, or as a hot shot of pure festive joy.4 egg yolks3 tbsp soft brown sugar4 tbsp marsala or dessert wine1 tbsp brandy (optional)1 pinch saltNutmeg, to serve (optional)Find a heatproof bowl that will sit over, but not touch, a pan of simmering water, and put that water on to boil.Put the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl and whisk until thick and creamy. Gradually beat in the alcohol and salt, then set the bowl over the pan and continue to whisk, scraping the base of the bowl as you go, until the whisk leaves an impression in the mixture and, when lifted up, drops a fairly solid ribbon trail on the surface of the mixture.Remove the bowl from the pan and put on a cool surface. Keep whisking for another couple of minutes, then ide between bowls and serve (I like a grating of nutmeg on top).• Zabaglione or sabayon: do you have fond memories of this classic Italian dessert, or do you have another last-minute festive favourite up your sleeve?

Only twice in the last 10 years have the team top of the league on Christmas Day not gone on to win the title and on both occasions it was Liverpool, in 2013-14 and 2008-09. Klopp insists the statistic is irrelevant to his team’s prospects in 2019 and that Liverpool’s attempt to win a 19th league championship should be embraced at Anfield.“We don’t want make ourselves smaller than we are but I can feel it,” the Liverpool manager said. “Nobody here is used to dealing with the success of Liverpool but a lot of people feel for this club. Somebody already asked me after the Wolves game: ‘Is it your’s to lose?’ He asked me that! Wow! That is really crazy.“If you want to have guarantees, go for another sport. If you want to be sure that in May it will be something really special but you don’t want to see the way to that day, then take a holiday. I don’t know where the Premier League is not broadcast but find a little country where it is not and go there.“If you want to enjoy the ride, and want to try everything you can to be as successful as possible, then welcome, let’s go for it. That is all we can do. Nothing else, and not because our grandfathers did or didn’t do it. That has no influence.”Klopp maintains he does not feel any added pressure given Liverpool’s commanding start and slender advantage over City, whom they visit on 3 January. “There is no pressure, I don’t see the pressure,” he said.“There is pressure because we want to win against Newcastle and that is difficult enough. If I saw someone in a pre-match interview asking a player about May and stuff like that, I would take the mic and throw it somewhere. Only because that is not fair. We have to play football, not think about what we can do in the summer.“If we are not first in the table on 3 January for example then we would probably have lost a game. Does that mean that everything we have done so far is shit? If we lose a game one day and everybody immediately starts saying we showed we cannot deal with the pressure, there are still 17 games to go or whatever. There is no extra pressure on us because of a four-point gap.”Klopp, who expects to have Trent Alexander-Arnold back from injury for the Newcastle game, said his team will keep their focus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91fd2e949873b4388e2be48edaf9f710981cff0e/0_57_2709_1625/master/2709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dea96c4fd527da33bf91655e4f0b6832","title":"fulham wolves premier league match report","story":"Romain Saïss scored an 85th-minute equaliser as Wolves denied Fulham victory at Craven Cottage.Ryan Sessegnon had given Claudio Ranieri’s side the lead with 16 minutes to go, the youngster hammering home his first Premier League club.But the Cottagers, who began the day bottom of the Premier League table, could not hang on and Saïss was on hand to tap home Ivan Cavaleiro’s cross with five minutes to go.• Full report to follow shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e195565420c3970c6f7d530ce4b986f0d0b22f/0_80_3160_1897/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e622645ec86451a399f0a20b0f37ca","title":"fulham wolves premier league live","story":"It feels like a bodyblow.

Very disappointed. I feel like I played well but I didn’t score and that’s the most important thing for a striker. I feel angry, I want to cry. Trust me. Mitrovic looks genuinely devastated. He’s been given man-of-the-match, by the way. This will feel like two points dropped for Fulham, although they probably didn’t do enough to win. But with five minutes left, at home, against a mid-table side, Ranieri will have hoped for more. Moutinho and Cavaleiro were afforded so much space around the Fulham box. By the time it reached Bryan at the back post, it was too late.Fulham off the bottom of the league with that point. Ranieri embraces Moutinho on the pitch, they were together at Monaco remember back in 2013-14. Probably a fair result, Fulham shaded the first half, Wolves the second.90+2 min: Frantic stuff here, the crowd has really picked up. Wolves have a Doherty header saved, and see a Saiss effort flash wide. 90 min: Coady clears the ball off the line! A long ball from Fulham has Bennett, Coady AND Boly scrambling. Mitrovic somehow wins the ball off all three, skips past Bennett and lifts the ball over the outcoming Rui Patricio! The ball just clips Bennett, rolls towards the goal, and Coady just about gets back to tackle the ball away, before himself sliding into the net. Inches away from a second Fulham goal!Three minutes added on here! 89 min: Nervy goalkeeping from Sergio Rico, who hasn’t really impressed me at all this season – his punch could have gone anywhere from Cavaleiro’s cross, but fell to a white shirt. I wonder if Bettinelli will get another chance in the coming weeks. 88 min: Fulham hanging on a bit here now. 1-1! Moutinho slipped a nice ball between full-back and centre-back to Cavaleiro, who sent a low cross across the six-yard box. It misses everyone but Helder Costa gives Joe Bryan a bump at the back post, the ball falls kindly to Saiss, who taps into an open net! A first Premier League goal for Saiss! Fulham couldn’t hold on!81 min: Huge 10 minutes or so for Fulham, remember they will get to within a point of climbing out of the relegation zone with a win here.79 min: “Is anyone else finding the “one of our own” chants a little disturbing?” emails James Guppy. “The implication is any foreign born player, despite wearing the same team strip, is not ... one of their own.”Not sure I really agree with that. Think that’s a chant just for a player that comes through the youth system, regardless of their nationality. Invariably, they will be English. Sessegnon was born in Roehampton, down the road from Craven Cottage, while Gibbs-White was born in Stafford, 16 miles from Wolverhampton.77 min: That is a HUGE goal for Fulham, who have defended stoutly without much attacking intent in this second half. It’s amazing the resilience that Ranieri has instilled in the last couple of games.1-0! Mitrovic did really well to bully Saiss and win a free-kick, from which Ream headed across goal. Rui Patricio could only get a nervy glove on the ball and Sessegnon pounced, scuffing a half-volley through three Wolves defenders on the line. By the time Saiss got a block on the ball, he was already a yard behind the line – Andre Marriner checked his watch and gave the goal! Fulham score with their first shot in the second half. The 18-year-old has done it, off the bench.72 min: Kamara comes off for Cairney. That’s their final substitution. Kamara looks pretty gutted, but he hasn’t done an awful lot. 70 min: Not a shot, but Fulham finally spring forward, Seri releasing Sessegnon, who is playing as a high left winger. Sessegnon uses his pace to get to the byline, crosses for Kamara, but a brilliant tackle from Boly negates the danger. Better from Fulham.66 min: Bennett, Wolves centre-back, volleys high and wide. I genuinely have no idea what he was doing so far forward in open play. Fulham respond immediately to that change in shape by throwing on Ryan Sessegnon, who replaces Andre Schurrle. More “One of our own” chants, this time from the home crowd. 64 min: Wolves make a second change: Gibbs-White for Helder Costa. The away fans serenade the 18-year-old with “He’s one of our own” as he walks off the pitch. Looks like Wolves will change to a more familiar 3-4-3 now. 63 min: Big fan of the commentator using the adjective ‘tubthumping’, there. 62 min: An email from Brendan Pooley: “It would be great to see Wolves win today just to keep up the competition for the Europa League.”60 min: Jiminez takes a curling shot from the edge of the area. Not in the corner but bounces awkwardly in front of Sergio Rico and the Fulham keeper is lucky that the rebound falls to Bryan rather than any Wolves player following up the shot for an easy tap-in.56 min: Wolves moving the ball a lot quicker. 54 min: A question for Wolves and Fulham fans, would you take a draw here?Tweet me @michaelbutler18 or email me michael.butler@the.52 min: Another cross comes in from the left and Gibbs-White tries the acrobatic overhead but sort of gets in the way of Jiminez and the ball breaks kindly for Sergio Rico. 50 min: Wolves have certainly started the better. Cavaleiro, Gibbs-White and Jonny have all made forays to the byline without success, although Jonny did dig out a cross for Jiminez. 48 min: Damn those new pred boots are nice. Not quite as nice as the ones in the early 2000s – with the tongue that stretched over the toe – but not half bad. 46 min: Kamara goes down after a high foot from Boly. Seri picks out Ream at the back post but the American can’t quite connect. Wolves make one half-time change, which I’m sure is tactical. Ivan Cavaleiro comes on for Adama Troaré. Wonder what effect that will have on Wolves’s shape. Is there a better beard in the Premier League than Wolves manager Nuno Espírito Santo?

Pep Guardiola also makes three changes, with Danilo, Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero in for Kyle Walker, Nicolas Otamendi and Gabriel Jesus. At Wembley, Dele Alli is absent for Spurs after being withdrawn at Everton with a hamstring injury.

For an increasing number of festive fun-seekers, however, taking part in an organised activity during Twixtmas – which kicks off on Christmas Day and finishing on New Year’s Day – is now as much a part of the calendar as the Queen’s speech or getting irate with your relatives.On Christmas Day thousands of swimmers, many of them donning their bathers for charity, gathered for icy dips in places from Tenby to Torquay or met up for the annual yuletide park run. Large-scale ball games of Uppies and Downies, a sporting endeavour with varying rules, kicked off in a towns including Workington in Cumbria and Kirkwall in Orkney, where it is called the Ba’ game. And should you be lucky enough to find yourself in the picturesque Cotswolds this Boxing Day, it would be near criminal not to take part in the famous Bibury duck race.So why are so many people taking part in slightly oddball pastimes over the Christmas period? Ella Foote from the Outdoor Swimming Society says the number of people ready and willing to take a icy dip before the end of the year is growing year on year.“It’s definitely become a huge thing, and attracts a lot of people that only do it at this time of year,” says Foote, who has been raising money for the mental health charity Mind by taking a cold-water dip every day this month. “For swimmers particularly it’s become a really social thing, Christmas dinner tastes a lot better if you’ve swam in cold water in the morning.”The members-only Christmas Day swim in the Serpentine, Hyde Park, London, now has to be limited to 70 participants for safety reasons, says Robin Hunter, the president of the Serpentine Swimming Club. The swim has taken place since 1864, and carried on throughout all the war years. “Whether trying to raise sponsorship or visibility for their activity, we do it because a bunch of people started 150 odd years ago and we’re keeping up the tradition,” he says.A festive run has also become quite normal. Five years ago there were 101 Christmas Day park runs, but this year there were 400. Three-mile park runs are weekly event across the UK. Andy Evans, the event director of the Tring park run in Hertfordshire, says about 100 runners came to the first Christmas run four years ago, but that this year he is expecting 250.“Lots of our runners come week after week, so it feels natural to see them on Christmas day,” he says. “Particularly for people who might be on their own at Christmas, and who won’t get a family visit it is an event to go where you will see your wider social family.”Boxing Day events include two duck races in Bibury, where thousands of plastic ducks race under the village’s bridges to raise money for charities and the local cricket club. It’s all very jolly, says Terry Day, the founder of the event and the cricket club’s groundsman. “It’s very popular and the club put on mince pies and mulled wine. We have visitors from around the world, but it’s great to see all the villagers come together.”It’s a bit of fun, but a big event in the village’s calendar, says Virginia Ryselyte, the reception manager at the Swan hotel: “It’s a lovely family day, but oh my goodness it gets competitive.”Other events are a bit more rough and tumble. The Ba’ game in Kirkwall, Orkney, involves the whole town split into two teams –the Uppies and the Doonies. The Uppies have to get the ball to a marked wall high up in the town, while the Doonies try to get it to the harbour. Teams can be up to 100 strong and the game, which dates back to at least the late 19th century, draws about 1,000 onlookers, according to Charles Tait, a local photographer who has an exhibition chronicling the history of the event on at Kirkwall’s Old Library.A Ba’ game bookends the festive period for Orcadians, with the final match held on New Year’s Day. If it sounds like a lot of effort from the comfort of your sofa, it is – but it’s worth it, says Tait. “It’s taken very seriously. It’s far more important than Christmas dinner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a206ef49fa77b1ac835c27da59b8722b4783e9/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eda4ac745e7e6373e8e183233f29afa","title":"turkey fajitas cheeseboard fondue comfort food boxing day leftovers recipes","story":"After the stress of Christmas dinner, take it easy with these simple, crowd-pleasing recipes, guaranteed to make the most of your leftoversAny keen cook – professional or amateur – knows that playing around with leftovers is often more fun than making the main dish in the first place, and Christmas is a bumper time for experimentation. In the aftermath of the biggest meal of the year, though, it is also a time to give yourself a break, with some recipes that are as easy to throw together in between bracing walks and refereeing family rows as they are to enjoy in front of the big Boxing Day film.Save the showstoppers for New Year’s Eve, in favour of simple crowdpleasers: a fiery turkey stir-fry is always a good shout after a couple of days of more traditional British festive flavours, and no one is going to turn their nose up at nut roast burgers with cranberry sauce, or stale mince pies crumbled into vanilla ice cream. If you don’t have enough savoury leftovers to make a whole meal, then chop them up finely and add them to a meaty ragu, or a zingy curry.But first, relax. After the stress of cooking for the big day, this is the fun bit: the ideas below are just that, so feel free to adapt them to what you have on hand: sometimes the weirdest combinations yield the most delicious results. Although I’ll be honest, I’m not sure if brussels sprouts go with absolutely everything …This is a great way to empty the fridge, and makes a killer Boxing Day breakfast or quick supper. It is almost infinitely adaptable, so make it vegan by using only leftover veg or, alternatively, add roughly chopped pigs in blankets, shredded turkey etc, as you like, and serve with bread sauce if there is any still hanging around.Per person¼ onion, thinly sliced½ tbsp olive oil or goose fat, lard or dripping from the roast, plus a little more for the egg if using150g cooked veg (potatoes, sprouts and root veg are all ideal), chopped into bite-size pieces¼ tsp smoked paprika¼ tsp cumin seeds1 egg (optional)Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the onion and cook until it is soft and golden. If you are serving it with an egg, turn the oven on low.When the onion is done, stir in the paprika and cumin and cook for another minute or so, then scoop into a bowl, leaving as much fat in the pan as possible, and turn up the heat.Once the pan is sizzling hot, add the veg and stir-fry until it crisps, then return the onion to the pan.Keep the bubble and squeak hot in the oven while you heat a little more oil in a small pan and fry the egg. Serve on top, with a sprinkle of extra paprika.Remember the 90s, when guacamole liberated the avocado from vinaigrette, and Tex-Mex was the coolest food on the block? Sizzling fajitas may have been replaced by overstuffed burritos or tiny tacos, but they are still as fun, and delicious, as ever. The accompanying slaw adds crunch, and is a useful way to use up excess sprouts, but can be replaced with shredded lettuce if you prefer – and you can use fresh tomatoes in the guacamole if you can find good ones in December.Serves 42 onions 2 red peppers2 green or yellow peppers2 tbsp oil4 garlic cloves, crushed400g roast turkey2 tsp brown sugar2 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground coriander1 tsp chipotle or other chilli flakesSqueeze of lime juiceFor the sprout slaw200g brussels sprouts2 spring onions1 red jalapeño (optional) 4 tbsp fresh orange juice2 tbsp oil (I like avocado)SaltFor the guacamole 2 ripe avocadoSmall bunch of coriander2 sun-dried tomatoes (optional)1 limeStart by making the slaw. Trim the sprouts and finely shred them crossways: you can use a food processor to do this if you prefer, but it doesn’t take long. Separate the slices as you put them into a bowl, then sprinkle with salt. Slice the spring onions and jalapeño, discarding the latter’s seeds, and add to the same bowl. Drizzle with orange juice and oil and toss well. Taste and season further if necessary. Set aside.Cut the onion into chunky slices, and repeat with the peppers, discarding the seeds. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, and cook the onions until they begin to soften, then add the peppers and cook until both are soft and beginning to char slightly.Meanwhile, to make the guacamole, slice the avocados in half and scoop out the flesh, discarding the stone. Roughly chop and then mash to a chunky puree. Finely chop the coriander and tomatoes, if using, stir into the avocado and season to taste with salt and lime juice.Heat tortillas in a dry pan, and keep warm in a low oven.When the peppers and onions are ready, stir in the garlic and cook for another minute or so. Toss the turkey with the sugar and spices and add to the pan. Turn up the heat and toss well with the lime juice until hot. Serve with the warm tortillas, slaw, guacamole and any other sides you fancy.The great thing about this recipe is that you can use just about any cheese – perfect for seeing off all those odds and ends. The only thing to be wary of is it getting too hot, especially if you scale up the recipe to deal with more cheese. For this reason, I use a bain-marie, though if you have a fondue set or heat diffuser for your hob, then use that instead. If it does split, then whisk another teaspoon of cornflour with the same of cold water and gradually whisk it in until it comes back together.Serves 4350g-400g cheese, any rinds removed150ml dry white wine (leftover fizz is perfect)1 garlic clove, squashed1 tsp cornflourDash of port or brandy (optional)Nutmeg, to grate (optional)Boiled new potatoes, toast, gherkins, lightly steamed vegetables, to serveGrate hard cheese and cut softer ones into small chunks, keeping them separate. Boil a half kettle of water and prepare the accompaniments.Put the wine in a small pan with the garlic and bring to a simmer. Whisk a little into the cornflour to make a paste, then whisk this into the rest of the wine.Pour the boiling water into a saucepan over a medium-high heat, and the wine into a heatproof bowl big enough to sit just over the water without touching it.  Allow to heat up again, then gradually whisk in the cheeses, starting with the soft ones that will melt most easily and leaving hard ones until last.Once it has all melted, whisk in the port together with a grating of nutmeg, if using, and serve immediately with the accompaniments for dipping – preferably still over the pan of hot water to keep it warm and liquid.Christmas pudding is pretty great fried up in a little butter for breakfast, but if you want to make more of a ceremony of it, then this aptly named mess will make mincemeat of the leftovers. I have given the amounts per person, but it also works well in a big bowl.Per person75ml cold whipping cream1 tbsp brandy, rum or whisky1 tsp brown sugarPinch of nutmeg1 tangerine75g cooked Christmas pudding 1 tsp pomegranate seeds (optional)1 tsp flaked almondsPut the cream, alcohol, brown sugar and nutmeg in a large bowl and whisk until it forms soft peaks.Peel the tangerine and remove as much white pith as possible, then cut into rings.Crumble half the pudding into inidual glasses or a serving bowl and spoon some of the cream on top, followed by the tangerine. Repeat these layers, and finish by decorating with the pomegranate seeds and almonds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d23c2590badf28bcd144dfff6fc3d6a454d30e28/0_0_3024_4032/master/3024.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83d12d88d29c78b317940b341341d1f7 1440w","title":"dreaming bright christmas britain best festive displays in pictures","story":"Every December, many streets in Britain light up like Christmas trees and homes are adorned with snowmen, Santas and bucketfuls of fake snow.

The firm has faced criticism over the distribution of fake news on its platform and the revelation that the personal Facebook data of 50 million people was improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that went on to work for Donald Trump.Sorrell, who is attempting to relaunch his advertising career as a digital guru following his acrimonious departure this year from WPP, told the  that Facebook’s Instagram unit was providing a commercial counterweight to the company’s main network.“Facebook includes Instagram,” said Sorrell, who has re-emerged as a digital specialist under his new advertising venture S4 Capital. “From what I’ve seen there might be some nervousness around Facebook. But there has been an increased focus on Instagram. Whatever Facebook is losing around the Facebook swing it is probably gaining on the Instagram roundabout.”Sorrell, a renowned workaholic when he was at WPP, spent an extended Christmas break with his family in Latin America, having attended the lavish wedding of the daughter of India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani.Sorrell made an abrupt and headline-grabbing departure in April from WPP, the advertising giant he founded more than three decades ago, in a scandal involving allegations of personal misconduct.In June, Sorrell “strenuously” denied paying for a sex worker using funds from WPP, the company he founded and developed into the world’s largest advertising group. WPP, which has been accused of being too cumbersome for the digital age, lost the number one spot in October to US rival Omnicom.Sorrell, who was always something of a digital evangelist at WPP, said he had become even more strident in his views about digital.“S4 was born and bred in digital,” he says. “There has been no contamination, if that is the right way of looking at it, from traditional media.”S4 is attempting to strike the balance between global scale and fulfilling Sorrell’s mantra of “faster, better, more efficient”. The two businesses Sorrell has bought so far employ 1,200 people, WPP has more than 130,000 staff.Mark Read, WPP’s new chief executive, has embarked on a slimline strategy designed to make the company fit for an increasingly digital future, including co-locating or shutting almost 200 offices, cutting 3,500 jobs and merging some of its most venerable ad businesses. WPP, which owns the Grey and Ogilvy \u0026amp Mather agencies, is merging its J Walter Thompson and Wunderman units.However, having lost a string of major clients including a sizeable chunk of Ford, American Express, United Airlines, Pepsi, Bayer, Opel, GlaxoSmithKline and part of Daimler, Read has admitted WPP faces a “headwind” of several hundred million dollars to make up before 2019 effectively can be considered to have “started”.Read’s revival strategy is founded on a belief that the ad industry is undergoing structural change, which WPP can cope with, and not wholesale structural decline, which would signal potentially the end of the global holding company model. He has promised a a “radical evolution”that he says will have returned it to the growth levels of peers such as Omnicom, IPG, Dentsu Aegis, Publicis and Havas by the end of 2021. Investors will hopefully be patient as he strives to prove his plan is right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16ec4ef56ff7d84f03369b0d701fa65fc683b5ca/0_91_3768_2261/master/3768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fc64a1da12736982de44a3e9d62f64e","title":"aldi online returns christmas tree","story":"Sending back a large item that turned out not to be as described proved almost impossibleI bought an artificial Christmas tree from Aldi’s website for £44.99 which was described as being supplied in a box with a handle and having hinged branches. When I started setting it up, I realised the branches on the top third of the tree were not hinged, and it was in a box with no handle.I called customer services as the tree was not as described and was told the only option was to return it. I was advised that a collection was only possible Monday to Friday between 7am and 7pm, meaning I would have to take a day off work (not ideal at this time of the year). I raised a fuss with customer services and it said I could take it to a store (very difficult if you don’t drive and the nearest Aldi is miles away), negating the point of having something delivered! The website advertises how Aldi can deliver large items if they are difficult to transport. But it does not give any information on returning them (it only directs you to call customer service).Aldi has refused to collect the tree on a weekend, so I am stuck. All I have asked for is that collection is arranged for the weekend and for a time window of fewer than 12 hours, or a part refund given. It seems the policy has been deliberately set to make it as hard as possible to return a defective large item! MS, Chepstow, MonmouthshireYou are right – the convenience of online shopping is negated by restrictive delivery policies like this and you should not have been burdened with this hassle.We contacted Aldi and it says: “We’re sorry MS was unhappy with his product. We have offered a full refund to apologise for the inconvenience caused.“We have also provided options for the return if his home address is not convenient, including for this item to be collected from a neighbour, picked up from a work address or returned in store.”We suggest it gives clearer advice on returning large items on its website.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

The total value of homes purchased by Londoners outside the capital previously peaked at £37bn in 2007, Hamptons International said. The average price of a home bought by a Londoner outside the capital has also increased and now stands at 398,910. More than three-quarters of Londoners leaving the capital in 2018 moved elsewhere in the south-East, the south-west or east of England. But with affordability in the south stretched, an increasing proportion of Londoners are moving further afield, the report found. Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons International, said: “Historically most people moving out of London have done so because of changing priorities, such as starting a family or generally wanting a slower pace of life. “But increasingly as affordability in the capital is stretched, more households are looking beyond the confines of London to buy their first home. “For many this means moving further afield to areas such as the Midlands and North where they can get more for their money. “Despite a rise in the number of London leavers this year, 2018 is likely to be a peak. A slower housing market in 2019 will likely mean that we see fewer Londoners buying homes outside of the capital than in 2018.” The figures are based on data from estate agency and property services group Countrywide, which Hamptons International is part of, and have been scaled up to give an estimate of property purchases by Londoners across Britain. Here is where Londoners moving to elsewhere in Britain are going, with how the proportions were ided up in 2018, according to Hamptons International (percentage figures have been rounded): "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77151560224d4d2cf5b31550b02a53761ff4a350/492_0_2408_1445/master/2408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad2f6ab7b5e101507f693ef79f2b4aa6","title":"ariana grande resilience","story":"The singer has shown courage in the face of trauma, tragedy and tabloid sniping to become the voice of a mass movement towards broad-mindedness and staunch optimism‘remember when i was like hey i have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA bitch u thought,” Ariana Grande confided in her 59.4 million Twitter followers last month. It was the kind of darkly funny self-deprecation her fans have come to know and love – more like a text you’d send to your best friend than to a group as big as the population of Italy.This has been the worst year of her life, as a visibly emotional Grande herself said when she accepted the woman of the year award at the Billboard Women in Music awards recently. Released in April, her single No Tears Left to Cry marked her return to music after the terror attack at her Manchester concert in May 2017. Earlier this year, she ended her two-year relationship with the rapper Mac Miller after his substance abuse became, in her words, “toxic” (he died of an accidental overdose in September). The following month, after a highly public whirlwind romance, Grande called off a short-lived engagement to the Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson.But it has also been her biggest year professionally. Her fourth album, Sweetener, was widely acclaimed and will be up for best pop vocal album at the 2019 Grammy awards. A new, non-album single, Thank U, Next, has broken streaming records an album of the same name is promised imminently. In March, she will embark on a world tour, promising a special show for Manchester.In the throes of personal upheaval and heartbreak – not to mention the workaday grind – Grande has not only found resilience but sought to spread it. Her One Love Manchester concert raised £17m for victims and their families. Three months later, while still experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, she performed at the Concert for Charlottesville benefit for victims of an attack at a far-right rally in Virginia. This March, she met survivors of the Parkland, Florida school shooting at the March for Our Lives in Washington DC.Grande has aligned herself with Black Lives Matter, against Trump, and for gun reform and gender equality. She articulated her post-Manchester philosophy to Elle magazine as trying “to spread the fucking light”. She went on: “Not everyone is going to agree … but that doesn’t mean I’m just going to shut up and sing my songs. I’m also going to be a human being who cares about other human beings to be an ally and use my privilege to help educate people.”Musically, too, she has turned towards the light. Sweetener is a steadfast expression of optimism, its title track a reference to seeking out and savouring the good. On Thank U, Next, she expresses gratitude for the lessons of her past relationships – including that with Davidson, only three weeks after their split. One fan tweeted: “Who is Ariana’s therapist and are they accepting new clients?”Almost every review and interview has marvelled at her fortitude – she is the inverse of the archetypal child star who grows up without coping mechanisms. A former Broadway and Nickelodeon performer, Grande has been in showbusiness for close to half her life. But the events of the last 18 months make it easy to forget that her public image was once not so at odds with that of the young star warped by early fame.In 2014, the media gossip site Gawker proclaimed, 21-year-old Grande “went from ‘that girl from Nickelodeon’ to one of the biggest as on the planet. Allegedly.” It detailed (largely unsubstantiated) rumours that she had shoved a TV presenter to get her good side on camera, employed a personal water attendant, made fans at a meet-and-greet cry and wished that another crowd of fans would “all fucking die”. Jezebel embraced with gusto the tabloid rumour that Grande demanded to be “literally carried like a baby” by her staff, eventually claiming to substantiate it with “OVERWHELMING photographic evidence”.Whether Grande’s reputation at this time was deserved is unclear (she did edit the caption of a photograph showing her being carried to clarify that her “toes were LITERALLY BLEEDING”). But “a” was an appropriate label in one sense: Grande’s 2013 debut album, Yours Truly, laboured to communicate her mastery of a virtuoso vocal range that has been compared to Mariah Carey, often at the expense of the songs and, infamously, the enunciation. With her public image little more developed than that of a little girl with a big voice, it was easily distorted by what became known as “donutgate”.In July 2015, TMZ published security footage of Grande, then 22, larking about in a California doughnut shop with her new boyfriend. She licked a doughnut she hadn’t paid for and remarked: “I hate Americans. I hate America.” The shop’s health rating was lowered and the owner said he thought Grande should be charged a former Miss Kansas said she was “disgusted that someone can lack so much decency”.Looking back, the outrage reflects either a more innocent time or an early indicator of today’s “alternative facts” bubble. Grande apologised for her word choice, saying she was expressing frustration at high child obesity rates in the US – a PR move that raised eyebrows but not her reputation. The 2016 DNC email hack revealed that “donutgate” cost her a gig at the Obama White House.Yet, for all her notoriety among gossip bloggers and rightwing pundits, Grande was not quite a household name when her Manchester concert was attacked. By then she had pivoted to cheeky, forthright pop on her well-received third album, Dangerous Woman, landing her somewhere between demure Taylor Swift and the more daring Demi Lovato in the layperson’s pop-star nexus.The suicide bomber struck in the foyer at 10.30pm on 22 May 2017, just after the encore. Twenty-three people were killed and 139 wounded. Grande’s mother, Joan, was in the audience, desperately searching for her child. “Everyone was leaving, and I was going towards the stage,” she told Elle. “Those minutes when you don’t know what’s happening – there are no words.” Grande’s statement to her fans that night momentarily became the most-liked tweet in history: “broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’t have words.”As the New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote in his review of Sweetener: “No pop career should ever have a terrorist attack as a milestone.” But it is undeniable that Grande’s response to the Manchester bombing changed her public image. She struck a stateswomanly figure at the star-studded One Love event, defiantly performing her raunchiest hits at the request of one victim’s mother after the Daily Mail suggested that the bomber targeted the concert because of her sexualised aesthetic. She closed with a stripped-back rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow that was no less moving for its technical prowess. Her image – until recently subject to definition by other people – came into focus as standing for courage, integrity, resilience, hope.Even Piers Morgan, never one to let go of a stick with which to beat women, admitted to having “misjudged her”. She was weeks shy of her 24th birthday. “We put a lot on her shoulders,” said her manager, Scooter Braun. “And she took over. You know, for the rest of her life, she can say that she is exactly who she claims to be.” The following month she was made the first honorary Mancunian, the city council moving unanimously to recognise the contribution of this “young American woman for whom it would have been understandable if she never wanted to see this place again”.Speculation that her new music might be maudlin by the weight of what it had to acknowledge proved misplaced. Lingering on “the absolute worst of humanity” would give it power, she told Time: “The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.” With Sweetener, Grande embraced joy without pretending it was easy. Working with Pharrell and producer Max Martin, she landed on a looser, more idiosyncratic sound, placing emotional acuity above vocal technique. “Here is my bleeding heart, and here is a trap beat behind it,” is how she characterised it.Critic Lindsay Zoladz named Sweetener the year’s pop album to beat: “A defiant record, chronicling both the difficulty and necessity of choosing to be happy.” Grande has credited this defiance to more than a decade in therapy, first dating to her parents’ orce and ramped up post-Manchester. The tweet shouting out her therapist was “funny as fuck”, she replied, “but in all honesty, therapy has saved my life so many times. if you’re afraid to ask for help, don’t be.”Part of that work, Grande has said, has been advocating for good despite the risk of backlash – and, tellingly, doing so not just as a fundraising figurehead, but in small interactions that reflect a commitment to acting with integrity. When a fan linked Miller’s drink-driving charge to Grande’s having “dumped him for another dude” as “just the most heartbreaking thing happening in Hollywood”, Grande addressed the fan in a searing but respectful shutdown: “shamingblaming women for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let’s please stop doing that.”She was similarly scathing of Morgan’s criticism of Little Mix’s nude album shoot last month: “i look forward to the day you realize there are other ways to go about making yourself relevant than to criticize young, beautiful, successful women for everything they do”. Such “clapbacks” are a well-established currency of the celebrity ecosystem, but at a time when the highest-profile celebrities – Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Adele – are defined by their silence, Grande explains herself, and even apologises.When, in July, her fans questioned a tasteless joke by Davidson (he said, to demonstrate Grande’s celebrity: “Britney Spears didn’t have a terrorist attack at her concert”), Grande engaged. “This has been v tough and conflicting on my heart,” she tweeted (and, more recently, deleted). “ … I, of course, didn’t find it funny.” This month, chided by Kanye West for seeming to dismiss his mental illness to promote her new song Imagine she apologised for the “probably insensitive” remark without conceding much: “With all due respect, i don’t need to use anyone to promote anything. period.”Gossip blogger Elaine Lui, once one of Grande’s least sympathetic commentators, wrote approvingly of the woman emerging from “the girl who got caught on camera licking donuts”. Lui wrote: “She is showing how you can move on from it and organically change the way you are perceived without it feeling like she’s putting on and discarding personalities for convenience.” Thank U, Next felt like the culmination of that work. When it appeared a few weeks after the end of her engagement, it was reasonable to expect a scorched-earth diss about moving on to better things. Instead it was a beatific thank you from Grande to her exes. “Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage and rebuilds from the ground up,” wrote Vulture, naming it the best song of 2018. At the time of writing it has spent five weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, the first single by a female artist to do so since Sia’s Cheap Thrills in August 2016, and six weeks at No 1 in the UK.The song’s much-hyped, big-budget “video event”, spoofing teen movies Mean Girls, Legally Blonde, 13 Going on 30 and Bring It On, also broke a number of records, but by perpetuating archetypes rather than subverting them, it threatened to overshadow the lyrics’ quietly revolutionary sentiment. Similarly, another recent YouTube partnership, the Dangerous Woman Tour Diaries, was uncompelling, Grande’s presence unfocused in the meandering, PR-drawn definition of “documentary”. It suggests a risk that the forthrightness that make her so compelling could become more distant as her star rises.“Sometimes it’s kind of just about being the light in a situation,” said Grande of the power of pop music. The same could be said of the space she has created for herself in contemporary culture. Whether she caught wind of a society-wide turn towards hope or sparked it herself, it seems to be spreading. Some of this year’s biggest songs – the 1975’s Love It If We Made It Bastille and Marshmello’s collaboration with its chorus, “I want you to be happier” – were earnest expressions of hope in an uncertain future. Avengers: Infinity War, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Deadpool 2 had storylines about the rewards of acting with kindness and empathy. Even Pantone said its colour of the year – a vibrant burnt coral, carefully chosen to represent “a feeling that’s out there in the zeitgeist” – symbolises “our innate need for optimism”.Perhaps Grande realised its importance sooner than everyone else. Accepting Billboard’s woman of the year award, she said she may well be at the peak of her artistry, “but as far as my personal life goes I really have no idea what the fuck I’m doing”. She continued, her voice thickening: “I just want to say that if you’re someone out there who has no idea what this next chapter is going to bring, you’re not alone in that.” Then she pulled herself together and beamed. “Ew. I’m not going to cry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b1b664455e455d54e4371dac6109e00d204f5fd/0_1099_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=846a48e2749907744b70fad0379444dd","title":"readers on their albums of 2018","story":"Following our critics’ vote, we asked you to tell us what you have been listening to this year and why you think it’s worthy of celebrationA stunning reinvention of their sound which nevertheless sticks with the classic crooning tendencies and clever observational lyrics of Alex Turner. Favourite track: Four Out of Five is the obvious contender – a lead-off single with a festival-ready chorus. I also find The Ultracheese to be strangely moving. Guillaume, 35, FranceThis album is Suede at the top of their game. It’s just gorgeous: theatrical, dark, and energetic. One of few albums I regularly listen to straight through while doing absolutely nothing else, just enjoying its beauty. Favourite track: Flytipping. It is such a delicate yet powerful track with that lush Suede sound from every single instrument – including Brett’s voice. Honourable mention for Tides (those drums!). Juliet G, 41, LondonMelodies jostle for space with defiant rap and meld to comprise her most commercial but also her strongest album yet – this soundtracked my summer. Favourite track: Make Me Feel, the squelchy Kiss-esque masterpiece she reportedly co-wrote with Prince, is enough to make summer come all over again. Cat, 40, BrightonIdiosyncratic, varied songs with arresting, sparky, loose energy and a lyrical deftness which flatters the listener. Also doesn’t suffer from the production homogeneity which blights some otherwise interesting pop albums. Favourite track: Total Football. Amazing vocal delivery of the best lyrical conceit wrapped up in the most arresting and just plain fun band performance I heard this year. Greg, WiltshireA simply stunning slice of Americana. The first side features no silent space at all, as all the tracks bleed into one another with the listener unable, at first, to determine where one ends and the next begins. The reverse is more traditional, but the tracks still grow organically. Favourite track: The Seance on St Augustine St is a superb example of a song that develops from something quiet and contemplative into a rousing and thumping slab of rock. Stuart, 43, OxfordThe flow of the album is perfect with short, concise instrumentals that are moving, occasionally minimalistic, occasionally complex, and with lyrics that are honest and heartfelt and don’t dress anything up. The context of the album is also crucial: prior to release, Earl’s father had just passed away, he had cancelled a tour, citing anxiety and depression. Favourite track: Azucar – the most emotionally potent and one of the most personal and poetic songs Earl has ever written. Noah Sparkes, 16, West MidlandsDespite the relatively short runtime of Daytona, Pusha T manages to deliver the best bars of his solo career. Production from frequent collaborator Kanye West gives Pusha the best backdrop since the days of Clipse and the glitzy production of the Neptunes. Favourite track: No better example of this can be seen than on the song Santeria where the beat slowly builds towards a crescendo during a legendary third verse. Jake Nolan, 19, ManchesterAn immersive and technically stunning album. Beach House style appears monosyllabic, but the nuances and soundscapes are fresh and inventive. Favourite track: L’Inconnue. It shouldn’t work – it’s got overlayered choirs, sung in French, Victoria reciting numbers in French – but it delivers a glorious gooey pudding of sumptuousness. Bobby, WarwickshireThe artist’s moods are conveyed with brilliance through various means: choir, glitches, brutal introspective lyrics. It’s a little too uncomfortably intimate and, in a funny way, reassuring too. Thank goodness somebody else is as confused and muddled up as you are. I have rarely felt so engaged with music. Favourite track: It’s a concept album so I am not sure I can pick one, but at a push I’m Desperate which drew me to the album. It’s manic, dissonant at times, random at others. Cori, EdinburghDefinitely most moving album of this year. Perfectly cinematic, with striking instrumental production and Anna’s freezing voice on top of that. This is an album that will never bore you. Favourite track: After the live experience, I would choose Alpha, because of its vibrant bass beat that transfer you to some dark, naughty club. Martin Husarik, 25, Czech RepublicIt is a tumultuous expression of our modern era with a balance of their gritty, heavy slowcore and a vocal clarity that demands attention. I can’t stop listening. Favourite track: Poor Sucker is a dark, intoxicating track that is raw and angry without some of the violence of the rest of the album. Totally haunting. Charlotte, 33, BristolThe lyrics are as incisive as always, hilarious, and filled with bathos and joy. The musicianship is as tight and rhythmic as anyone could wish for. This is the only album this year I’ve actually gone into a shop to buy! Favourite track: Knobheads on Quiz Shows – an accurate and wryly observed declamation on the increase in crass stupidity, and how unembarrassed people are to be ignorant.Chantelle Bennett, 40Gruff’s off-kilter charm, restless energy and deft way with a melody has rarely faltered in 20 years, or sounded better than here. The orchestral arrangements are never overbearing, but they give the record a beautiful texture, every listen revealing a new little detail. Favourite track: Frontier Man was an instant classic (a friend of mine who found it deeply irritating at first eventually yielded when our holiday playlist kept it coming – its the kind of tune to which resistance is futile). Ian Rose, MelbourneA breath of fresh air: old-school indie guitar standards with a side helping of funk from a bunch of guys barely out of college. Has restored my faith in new music – no wonder these kids are signed to a label as cool as Heavenly. Favourite track: Let Your Dogtooth Grow starts with a burst of drumming that Keith Moon would have been proud of and has a guitar hook to match some of the best from Johnny Marr.The most anti hi-fidelity, anti FM radio album I’ve heard in recent years and it is all the more glorious for it. It somehow manages to be simultaneously (post) punk and prog. It has heavy grooves and a heavy atmosphere and draws you in deeper with every listen. Favourite track: Brean Down. The shift into the chorus temporarily bends my head every time I hear it.A brilliant burst of rage, intelligence, disorder and rhythm that demands you listen to each track again and again to pick up on those subtle, almost inaudible tunes and harmonies that hide behind the, at times, full on sounds. It’s an album made up of all the glorious bits behind Joy Division’s Atrocity Exhibition but mixed for a 2018 vibe. Favourite track: Holy Ghost – lo-fi start then a burst of a rap that feels like it’s accompanied by an old Moog synth backing.Ned, 58No other band or artist has quite hit upon the intense feelings of ision being felt around the world this year. From start to finish this record takes you on a journey through the highs and the lows, the whys, the hows and the seemingly endless search for answers. The way it effortlessly switches from the visceral to the sublime is key to the album’s appeal. Favourite track: Slow Seas – a song dealing with what it feels like to live in a world where seeing images such as those of drowned refugees is so commonplace. Rory Hall, 33, BanburyStrident, vibrant, absurd and poignant, you have to hear the whole thing from one of the hardest working and genuinely entertaining bands out there at the moment. Favourite track: Witchcraft tells of the emotional qualities of pregnancy with a nod to Mark E Smith. Kevin Jenkins, 57, PlymouthAn album very much of its time. Unnerving soundscapes and beautiful tones. It’s a piece of work you can either get lost in with headphones or experience the full visual engagement with each track’s allotted video. The best electronic music to emerge from Bristol in decades. Favourite track: From Here to Nowhere. Simple, beautiful. Along with the video it brings me to tears. John Kerridge, 57, BristolFantastically varied with some great collaborations with the likes of Róisín Murphy and José González alongside fantastic sampling such as the Justin Vernon’s vocal on Bonfire. Each track brings something a little bit different, from the melodic and atmospheric to downright funky. Favourite track: The infectious Pick Up was probably the sound of summer and in many DJs’ back pockets during festival season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14fe543cf09c84e6b67d9f09a640b4c48c7a9f6/0_0_3323_2215/master/3323.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a91b83985c6ac7d6990e1c500edb6cf 720w","title":"sajid javid defends deportation of grooming gang members","story":"Home secretary says stripping offenders of British citizenship would happen only in extreme casesThe home secretary, Sajid Javid, has defended the potential deportation of convicted grooming gang members to Pakistan even if it risks them reoffending.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Javid said stripping offenders of British citizenship would happen only in extreme cases involving iniduals with dual nationality.He was pressed on the issue by the programme’s guest editor, the Pakistani-British writer Kamila Shamsie, who pointed out that the lack of sex offender registers in Pakistan would make it easier for offenders deported from the UK to repeat their crimes.Javid responded: “I’m the British home secretary. My job is to protect the British public.”Seeking to clarify, Shamsie asked: “If you are sending members of grooming gangs to Pakistan, knowing that there is not a sex offenders registry, what they do there is not anything to do with you?”Javid said: “My job is to protect the British public.”In August, three members of a Rochdale grooming gang, who had Pakistani backgrounds, lost an appeal against a decision to strip them of their British citizenship.Javid, who was born in Rochdale, was asked whether he took such cases personally. He said: “When I heard about grooming gangs where almost every inidual involved is of Pakistani heritage, I can’t help noting that. But I can’t helping noting the fact that Rochdale is a town that means something to me and I’m also of Pakistani heritage.”He faced criticism over a Twitter message he posted in October about “sick Asian paedophiles” in a Huddersfield gang. Javid told Today: “I’m very much aware of the need for politicians to be careful with language as well as what they do. When it comes to gang-based child exploitation it is self-evident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent high-profile cases there is a high proportion of men that are of Pakistani heritage.”Ignoring this, he added, would fuel extremists. “Let’s not ignore it when we are trying to work out what might be the causes. There could be some cultural reasons, from the communities that those men came from that could lead to this type of behaviour.“If I had ignored it, or had been seen to ignore it, that is exactly what I think extremists would like to see in this country. It would give them oxygen and I refuse to do that.”Javid also highlighted the benefits of immigration. “It might sound strange coming from a home secretary – I’m a big fan of immigration and what it means for our country, in terms of how it makes us stronger … I see people all the time today and they really don’t care if their doctor is of Pakistani origin, what they care about is that they are getting a good service and these are people that they do really see as British. I do think society has changed very positively like that.”He said Islam was compatible with British values. “There are many Muslims that I know who are very devout ... that are model citizens in terms of what they do their job, how they care for others.”But he condemned those who saw as Islam as an ideology, saying he would make a distinction between “those who practise Islam and those who you might describe as Islamists, that are driven by an ideology, rather than practise their own religion in their own way with their own family and their own friends. They see it as their duty to spread to ideology and also to disrespect at the same time the laws of the country that they have chosen to live in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed1f679c9bf04d0e9fee20af840be96e030ed97/0_423_3869_2321/master/3869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146b3a6790978a853e311df0b979a940","title":"tell us how are you defying expectations about ageing","story":"If you’re still living life to the full at a time when many people expect you to be slowing down, we’d like to hear from youAre you in your 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or older?

Older people don’t get the services they have a legal right to. For example, a younger person with brain damage will have a care plan from the NHS that includes maintaining links with their family and accessing education.“An older person with the same level of functionality but suffering dementia, however, will have a social care plan costing many thousands of pounds less a week, which is based entirely around getting the older person out of bed, washed and breakfasted, all in half an hour.“God alone knows why it hasn’t been challenged in the courts in the same way that instances of racism or homophobia are. If you just flip the categories, you see how unacceptable ageism is. You hear those in the NHS say: ‘That person is too old for an operation’ but they’d never say they are ‘too black’ or ‘too gay’ for treatment.”A report by the Royal Society for Public Health found that ageist attitudes existed across generations, affecting health and wellbeing. Christopher Brooks, the senior policy manager at Age UK, said older people frequently experienced discriminatory treatment across public and private services.Rebecca Hilsenrath, the EHRC’s chief legal officer, said: “No one should be treated differently because of their age and Prof Green is entirely wrong to say that we do not take age discrimination extremely seriously.“Much of our work speaks to this. Our strength is that we do not look at issues in isolation and we work to improve the lives of everyone by tackling problems that affect multiple groups of people in areas such as healthcare, work and living standards.”Janet Morrison, the chief executive of Independent Age, said: “There’s casual ageism in terms of popular culture and attitudes, and there’s institutional ageism in across every sector, industry and service that you care to mention.“We need to start calling out ageism a lot more often. We need to challenge the stigma in the same way that it’s challenged with other protected characteristics. We need to be a great deal angrier about it than we currently are.”Brooks agreed that ageism was prevalent in British society. “Ageism matters because as we have an ageing population, it becomes increasingly important to the UK as a society and our economy that we treat people equally,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/394a6fb937bbed9d33e9b49c0810a67939693197/0_88_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edae6ad8f233bb616113acc932ef991c","title":"australia india boxing day test day one  report","story":"Mayank Agarwal made a half-century on debut as India ended the first day of the Boxing Day Test against Australia on 215 for two in Melbourne.Agarwal made 76 while Cheteshwar Pujara was unbeaten on 68 at the close as Australia toiled on what appeared to be another flat MCG pitch.Pat Cummins was able to cause problems with short deliveries and took two for 40 but some strong bowling from Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood went unrewarded.India won the toss and elected to bat.

The sport’s historians are now starting to piece together his storyA century later the truth of exactly what happened to Jimmy Peters is just out of reach. One can find little scraps of it, titbits, facts and hints. In the last few years different writers, historians and academics have tried to stitch it all together but the story is thin and full of holes no one thought to fill in until it was too late. We know Peters was good, as any man who plays for England must be, and we can guess that he was better than that, because of what he had to overcome. For 117 years, right up until 1988, Peters, who played in 1906, 1907 and 1908, was the only black man who ever played rugby union for England.The census records show Peters had a West Indian father and an English mother and that he was born in Salford in 1879. But most of what is known about his early years comes from a newsletter published by the orphanage where he spent his teenage years. The story, as it is set down there, is that his parents worked in a travelling circus, where his father met with what is described as “a shocking death in a lion’s cage”. This is a line one cannot read without wanting to know more. But nobody does because there are no precise dates and circus performers seldom used their real names.After that Jimmy’s mother passed him on to another circus troupe, where he was trained up to be a bareback horserider. When he broke an arm he was passed on again, from one home to another, until he finally fetched up in James Fegan’s orphanage in Greenwich. “He seems constructed differently to other human beings,” wrote Fegan, “all joints and springs inside – resilient as india-rubber in some parts, hard as ebony (and nearly as black) in others.” He was the orphanage’s “champion athlete”, their fastest runner, longest thrower, cricket and rugby captain.Peters grew up to be a carpenter. He settled in Bristol, where he played fly-half for Dings, Knowle and then Bristol FC. One of the club’s committee men resigned in protest when he was picked. A local paper described him as a “palid blackamoor”, and complained he was “keeping a white man out of the side”. Peters moved south to Plymouth, where he joined Plymouth Albion and played his way into the Devon County side. Peters was the star turn in the Devon team who won the county championship in 1906 and the papers started to push the RFU to pick him for England.“One can hardly refrain from referring to the great form displayed by Jago and Peters,” reported the Western Times after Peters’ Devon beat the Midlands. “They stood out in strong contrast to the other pair of halves, and the opinion was expressed all round that they ought to play together for England next Saturday. The powers that be, however, have decided otherwise. Colour is the difficulty. Peters is sacrificed. Pity for the chances of English success.” Jago was picked, along with five other members of the Devon side – but not Peters.The Plymouth Football Herald put it down to “racial convention”, the Yorkshire Post explained his “selection was not popular on racial grounds”. England lost that match and the next but Devon won again. They beat Durham in the championship final on 12 March, 16-3. Peters played superbly. And the England selectors finally gave in. He was picked to play against Scotland at Inverleith. His “dazzling passing” set up two tries in that match and he scored one himself in their next, against France. England won both. Despite that, and even though he was fit and in form, Peters was dropped from the team for England’s next match, which was against South Africa in autumn.That game, the one Peters did not play, came to be one of the defining moments of his career. The story was that during Devon’s tour match against South Africa earlier in the season the Springboks would not leave their dressing room, because they refused to share the pitch with a black player. Whether it really happened like that is not clear but it is true Peters was not selected for either of England’s two trial matches before the Test and that the rugby correspondent EHD Sewell put that down to the fact “South Africa preferred not to play against a coloured man”.Peters did play three more Tests, against Ireland and Scotland the following spring, and Wales the year after. And if he was under-appreciated by the RFU, they loved him down in Plymouth, where the Football Herald picked him as “man of the year” in 1907, though given the way they phrased their praise, it might not have been a prize he wanted. “Although not of our complexion Peters may accept the compliment that we regard him as a ‘white man’ in a land where to be regarded as a ‘white man’ confers a dignity to which a great many white men do not attain.”Peters’ career was cut short when he lost three fingers on his left hand while he was working a steam-planing machine. Albion threw him a testimonial match, which compromised his amateur status. So after that he moved into professional sport. He drifted into rugby league, at Barrow and then St Helens, and out of the public eye.When he died in 1954 his life got five lines in the Times and none at all in the . All these years later we can, at least, put that much right for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b4ef866f9bf026a250c7b37395c95c485940e8a/157_247_2940_1765/master/2940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21c5d25a62f2168077b809cd48026bc4","title":"talking horses gold cup winner native river can land king george vi chase horse racing tips","story":"As any schoolboy ought to know, Cheltenham and Kempton are very different tracks and horses which prosper at Prestbury are by no means certain to succeed in Sunbury. Still, it is odd indeed to see the reigning Gold Cup winner, Native River (3.05), being so cold-shouldered in the betting for this King George VI Chase.At the time of writing he is only sixth in the list with some firms, bigger in places than his stablemate Thistlecrack, who has not won for two years. He may not be the fastest or the flashiest in a fascinating field but Native River may very well be the toughest of them and represents excellent value at 6-1 or bigger.Some are put off by the memory of his third place behind Tea For Two in the novice chase on this card three years ago, when he jumped left at some fences and ran way below the level that will be required here. This will be his first time round a right-handed circuit since then.But he was only a novice and ran to a similar level that day as in his other races around then. Two things made Native River the horse we now know and both came at the end of that season: the switch to more aggressive, pace-pushing tactics and the employment of Richard Johnson as his jockey. Had both been in place when he ran at Kempton in 2015, he might have fared better. There is no shame in being bested by Bristol De Mai around Haydock, as Native River was last month. He will be fitter now and the grey, of course, is playing away from his favourite venue.Excuses are available for Might Bite’s Haydock flop and a much improved performance is expected here. Still, his odds are hardly generous in the circumstances and the memory persists of his being outbattled by Native River at Cheltenham. His chance rests on having too much pace for his rival on this drier surface.It looks like a King George in which stamina will be tested, which could be a problem for Politologue and Waiting Patiently. Thistlecrack was running on at the end of the Betfair and has a chance to get involved if that has brought him on.1.20 Kempton There was market support for Lough Derg Spirit when he made his fencing debut at Wetherby in October and he justified that with a comfortable success. The handicapper could have edged him up the ratings but opted to leave the six-year-old where he was, on a mark which could prove quite lenient for this former point winner. He comes from the Nicky Henderson yard that has won this three times in the last eight runnings.1.55 Kempton Henderson fields Santini here and victory for the hugely promising sort would surprise nobody. But at the likely odds a chance is taken on Topofthegame, who ran a huge race to chase home Defi Du Seuil at Exeter after blowing the start and losing 20 lengths. A useful hurdler always supposed to become a chaser, this chestnut has a big race in him.2.10 Wetherby The Rowland Meyrick could fall to Dan Skelton for a second consecutive year, thanks this time to Captain Chaos, a winner over the course and distance as a novice. He ran his best race for months when second in the Rehearsal, thanks to blinkers being refitted and to soft ground it was also his best effort against a double-figure field. With fewer rivals here and a 5lb pull with the Rehearsal winner, Lake View Lad, he looks the one to be with.2.30 Kempton Depth of competition has been sorely lacking in recent Christmas Hurdles and Buveur D’Air is surely going to be a fourth odds-on winner in the space of five years. His third place in Altior’s Supreme remains the only time he has been beaten over hurdles and his demolition of Samcro at Newcastle this month stands as a mighty deterrent against the very idea of taking him on here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec5299ef27bcbadd14bc48d862065a59c9accb2/0_19_3918_2351/master/3918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06b23e705bcc790412b3edd6216b2805","title":"king george vi chase boxing day racing","story":"And they’re off ...

Mister Fisher underlined his potential after casting aside a number of smart rivals in impressive fashion in the 32Red Casino Novice Hurdle at Kempton on Boxing Day. Having met with defeat went sent off favourite on his hurdling debut at Newbury last month, the Nicky Henderson-trained four year-old made up for that reversal in the two-mile prize.Ridden close to the pace, the 7-2 shot took command of matters between the final two flights before defeating early pace-setter Rouge Vif by two and three-quarter lengths. Henderson said: “He ran a good race at Newbury (when second on debut), but we just thought we would ride him more aggressively. He has enjoyed his work up front, so we let him do his own thing. They were trapping most of the way, too. He jumped very well and quickened up well.” Paddy Power cut the winner to 14-1 from the 33-1 for the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, and Henderson said: “You would have to think so (Supreme class). I’ve been lucky, with Angels Breath and a few others lurking in there.” Looking to more immediate plans, the Seven Barrows trainer said: “There is the Dovecote (at Kempton). I don’t think we will go to Musselburgh, as we got a lot of bloody noses up there last season.” PANicky Henderson fields Santini here and victory for the hugely promising sort would surprise nobody.

On a day when football looms large that’s a winner for the trainer and ex-England and Southampton player Mick Channon.Nicky Henderson won the opener with Mister Fisher - he has the favourite for the next in Lough Derg Spirit and that’s before we get on to the treble of Santini, Buveur D’Air and Might Bite! There was market support for Lough Derg Spirit when he made his fencing debut at Wetherby in October and he justified that with a comfortable success. The handicapper could have edged him up the ratings but opted to leave the six-year-old where he was, on a mark which could prove quite lenient for this former point winner. He comes from the Nicky Henderson yard that has won this three times in the last eight runnings.Matt Chapman on ITV Racing says “no one knows” if Might Bite will start favourite now for the King George. He’s drifted out to 4-1 joint-favourite with Waiting patiently. “My gut feeling is it will be Might Bite” says Chapman ...As any yule fule know, the going is the most important single variable in horse racing. The official going is good to soft, good in places. Mister Fisher won the opener at Kempton and times experts Simon Rowlands reckons the clock suggests it’s good to soft at the Sunbury track.The King George is always among the top betting events of the year and according to bookmakers.tv is now No4 in terms of amount the British public bet on the race behind only the Grand National, the Gold Cup at Cheltenham and the Derby. Apparently that’s partly down to the football with that and racing the two sports which take centre stage over Christmas. A spokesman said: “Racing and football betting go hand in hand on days like this and bookmakers are going overboard to compete for business in one of the busiest windows of the year away from Aintree.”I wrote that article about the King George in 2002 and it’s interesting to note from Tom Segal in the Racing Post that the last winner priced longer than 9-2 was back in 2003, underlining that this is a race for classy runners. This year’s contest is more wide open than normal as Greg Wood had highlighted and there will no doubt be as huge a crowd as usual at Kempton. That’s replicated elsewhere on a busy Boxing Day programme:The King George is the best jumps race of the year and the contest which almost always decides who is the supreme staying chaser. Since the 1960s the roll call of winners has been littered with the names of champions and multiple winners. I argued here many years ago about its superiority over the Gold Cup in revealing the best chasers. The best of them all, Arkle, won the race by a distance from Dormant in 1965 but a year later he was beaten by the same horse in a race in which he suffered a career-ending injury. That 1966 King George was on Pay TV so we only have this silent video of one of the most dramatic King Georges of all time:Chris Cook has been scouring the form book for the winner and if you click here you will find his Talking Horses briefing on racing at Kempton plus his tips for the other seven meetings. Spoiler alert: he’s gone for Native River in the King George.A crowd of around 20,000 racegoers – four times as many as for any other meeting so far this year - is beginning to squeeze itself into the bijou surroundings of Kempton Park racecourse ahead of the King George VI Chase at 3.05 this afternoon, and it promises to be one of the most open renewals of the big race for many years after steady support for Ruth Jefferson’s Waiting Patiently over the last 48 hours.Might Bite, last year’s winner, was a clear favourite on Christmas Eve at around 3-1 while Waiting Patiently, unraced since February, was a 5-1 chance with Politologue on 11-2. Might Bite has been friendless over Christmas, however, drifting out to 4-1 this morning, while everyone has been eager to get with Waiting Patiently, who is attempting to defy a couple of very dauting statistics this afternoon. No horse has won the King George on its seasonal debut, while Desert Orchid, in 1986, was the last to win on its first start at three miles.Politologue is also attempting to defy the latter trend, but has been the pick of quite a few tipsters this morning and is also very solid in the market as a result. As things stand, the King George now has joint-favourites at the best prices available, with Might Bite and Waiting Patiently both on 4-1, while Politologue is 6-1 in a place but more generally an 11-2 or 5-1 chance. Native River, the Gold Cup winner, is 6-1 with Bristol De Mai and Thistlecrack, the brilliant winner in his novice season two years ago, at 8-1 and 9-1 respectively. So that means there are six horses in a 10-runner field at a single-figure price and it is very difficult to think of a King George over the last 30 years that offered so many possibilities. With Buveur D’Air, the Champion Hurdle winner, also in attendance for what is likely to be a stroll to victory in the Christmas Hurdle and Santini, the RSA Chase favourite, lining up for the Kauto Star Novice Chase, it is an outstanding King George card even by Kempton’s normal standards and the action will get underway in just under an hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160dc7bff68ab9035701fee166141ccf47c39c8c/0_31_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=add39155395d9cf0a16507874c0a1150","title":"amazon anne rung government services authority","story":"Exclusive: Emails show how tech firm has tried to gain influence and potentially shape lucrative government contractsA top Amazon executive privately advised the Trump administration on the launch of a new internet portal that is expected to generate billions of dollars for the technology company and give it a dominant role in how the US government buys everything from paper clips to office chairs.Emails seen by the  show that the Amazon executive Anne Rung communicated with a top official at the General Services Administration (GSA) about the approach the government would take to create the new portal, even before the legislation that created it – known to its critics as the “Amazon amendment” – was signed into law late last year.Amazon and the Trump administration appear to have an antagonistic relationship because of the president’s frequent Twitter attacks on the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. But the behind-the-scenes lobbying by Amazon officials underscores how the company has quietly amassed an unrivalled position of power with the federal government.The 2017 correspondence between Rung – a former official in the Obama administration credited with transforming the federal government’s procurement policies before she joined Amazon – and Mary Davie at the GSA, offers new insights into how Amazon has used key former government officials it now employs – directly and as consultants – to gain influence and potentially shape lucrative government contracts.It has not yet been determined which companies will build the US government’s new e-commerce portal, but Amazon is widely expected to take on a dominant role, giving it a major foothold in the $53bn market for federal procurement of commercial products.Amazon is also the frontrunner to win a separate $10bn cloud computing contract with the Pentagon, known as Jedi, which will in effect move the defense department’s data on to a commercially run cloud computing system.Amazon already operates a cloud service for the US intelligence community, including a contract with the CIA, and has said it can protect even the most top secret data on a cloud that is walled off from the public internet.The company’s strength in its defense and intelligence business had largely been attributed to its hiring in 2011 of Steven Spano, a former brigadier general in the air force who has since left the company.Last year, Amazon also won a contract worth up to $5.5bn that made it the chief supplier of goods, including stationery and books, to tens of thousands of local governments and municipalities across the US.The spate of contracts, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that supports local businesses, reflected Amazon’s ambitions across the federal government, as well as state and local government.The company’s focus on Washington as its most lucrative customer was reflected in its decision earlier this year to choose nearby Arlington, Virginia, as one of its two new US headquarters, along with Long Island City, New York.“Amazon wants to be the interface between all government buyers and all the companies that want to sell to government, and that is an incredibly powerful and lucrative place to be,” Mitchell said.Amazon declined to comment on questions about how much of its business was currently connected to the federal government.Rung served as chief US acquisition officer under the Obama administration before she started working at Amazon on 1 November 2016. There she joined the company’s Amazon Business unit and focused on expanding the company’s government contract work.In just under a year on the job, emails that were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show Rung was in contact with Davie, a top GSA official, after the latter said she would be in Seattle and wanted to meet. Rung said it would make “a lot of sense” to meet.The topic of the meeting was focused on how the government ought to design a new e-commerce portal, even though the legislation that formally mandated the creation of the portal was not yet passed or signed into law.In one early morning email sent from her hotmail account on 20 September 2017, Rung told Davie that she would like to have a conversation with her – she called it a “gut check” – so that they could discuss their upcoming meeting.She wrote: “IF the legislation is enacted, I have a sense of how GSA will want to approach this (first you have to select providers, then you will want to implement something incrementallyphased approach), but I want to make sure that I’m not way off the mark. It will help me design a discussionagenda for our meeting next month.”When Rung asked Davie if they should wait until after the legislation is passed to discuss it, Davie responded that the administration was planning on moving ahead regardless of the outcome of the bill on Capitol Hill.Later, in January, the pair exchanged more friendly messages, with Davie asking for Rung’s suggestions on “awesome” candidates to fill a government position, and Rung (using her hotmail account) asking in turn whether Davie knew anyone who could run Amazon Business’s federal government business.Federal law mandates a “cooling off” period of one year before former senior government officials work on projects that they worked on in government. It is not clear whether Rung’s communication would be considered a violation of this specific ethics law because it is not know what exactly she worked on before leaving the government.Amazon declined to comment on the details of the exchange or provide any additional information about the RungDavie meeting. Amazon said Rung had been compliant with all White House ethics rules. It also said that it had been engaging in “continuous conversations with the GSA” and that it applauded the agency for “transforming the conversation around online portals”.The GSA said in a statement to the  that it had met with 35 companies in 2017 and 2018 to discuss “existing commercial capabilities and conduct market research” regarding the e-commerce platforms.“No company has been given special access. Instead, all companies expressing interest in the Commercial Platforms program have equal access to GSA,” the statement said. “We cannot speculate on which companies will be part of the proof of concept until proposals are received, evaluated, and awards are made.”Lisa Gilbert, the vice-president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said that while she did not believe that the engagement between Rung and Davie was a violation of the law, it was “unsavory” to think that former government officials used their inside knowledge of how the “ballgame” works for their corporate advantage.“There is nothing inherently wrong in talking to stakeholders who will be impacted by legislation. Our overwhelming worry is that corporate stakeholders have special access that other stakeholders – like public interest groups – do not get,” Gilbert said.Mitchell, the small business advocate, said the Rung emails “display an inside relationship that other competing companies don’t have” and showed how government infrastructure was being designed with input from Amazon, giving it a big advantage.“Bezos has been very astute playing to a liberal and conservative audience,” Mitchell said. “Meanwhile the federal government and administration is moving forward on all kinds of things that help Amazon, from the e-commerce portal to the Jedi contract to the tax law, which was a huge boon to Amazon.”This article was amended on 26 December to correct the name of the General Services Administration. The article had referred to the GSA as the Government Services Authority, which is not correct."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad817f457effbf9d1578da7591e93ca9e7bfaf78/0_0_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=104ab2e6b94b0e686cf8973cadbd185e","title":"10 great winter walks in uk readers travel tips","story":"Cold winds sweep marshes, hills, woods and moors from Rye to Pitlochry. But our tipsters are hardy and know the best routes – and some restorative pitstopsFor this eight-miler starting at Rye station, start by making your way through the town and along the A259, then left on Harbour Road and right on the private roadpublic footpath along the River Brede. Then past Camber Castle and across Nook Road to the seafront, and along the seafront to the mouth of the Rother, with detours into the nature reserve if you wish to enjoy wintering seabirds in the pools. Refresh yourself at the delightfully positioned William the Conqueror in Rye Harbour or the nearby Inkerman Arms (you could start and end your walk here, too) before heading back to Rye where there are dozens of quality eateries and watering holes to complete your festivities.AlbertThe 800-metre Mourne Mountains are the perfect place for a head-clearing, belly-busting, invigorating walk if the weather is set fair. A great starting point for several walks into the Mourners is the seaside town of Newcastle which has excellent restaurants and pubs. Start your walk by going up the Glen River valley and from there you can attempt various heights suited to your stamina. If you have time for a nine-mile route taking in the highest peak in the region, Slieve Donard, there is a fine walk at walkni.Maeve McCannFor a four-mile stroll with great views of the West Pennines, enter Sunnyhurst Woods in Darwen and walk to the grade II-listed Greenway Shelter. Take the steep path on the left to leave the woods at Sunnyhurst. Follow the path onto the moors and up to Darwen Tower (a folly built to commemorate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee). Admire the views as far as Snowdonia, Morecambe Bay and the Isle of Man from the tower before walking west to Ryal Fold and Tockholes (refreshments available from Vaughn’s Country Cafe or the Royal Arms). Follow the path by the side of the Royal Arms to the corner of Earnsdale Reservoir and then back down through Sunnyhurst Woods. Graham DeanThis rich and varied circular walk starts and finishes in Walberswick in the heart of the Suffolk Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Starting from the beach car park, the walk follows the shingle shoreline briefly before heading into the extensive Westwood marshes, which eventually give way to marshy woods, skirting heathland before joining a wooded track that leads to a delightfully quiet lane returning you to Walberswick. The walk is 7½ miles long and will take a couple of hours to complete at least so don’t start out too late on a winter’s day. Two pubs serving food can be found in Walberswick and a detailed leaflet can be downloaded. Nick StephenStart at Dawlish Station and follow the sea wall north towards Dawlish Warren. This takes you along what Network Rail called the most expensively maintained stretch of railway in the country and you’ll see where Isambard Kingdom Brunel had to cut through the Permian sandstone thus isolating the Langstone Rock. At Dawlish Warren, enjoy wonderful views over the Exe estuary and its thousands of wading birds from the cosy Mount Pleasant Inn perched above. This is one of two very good food stops on the route. Take the footpath at the foot of this abandoned cliff south past the Langstone Cliff Hotel, where your family will be welcome as non-residents to share a Devon cream tea or lunch. This path will return you to Dawlish along the clifftop. Brian HodgeThe 841-metre Ben Vrackie offers the perfect winter challenge. The walk, just over six miles from the Moulin Inn in Pitlochry, starts off gently and soon you’ll get stunning views of the summit and Loch a’ Choire. At this point (near a perfectly positioned bench) you have a choice: head up to the top of Vrackie, or loop back around the loch and stay low. If you choose the summit, you’ll be rewarded with fantastic views to the north over the Cairngorms. Either way, finish the walk with a well-deserved local ale next to the fire at the Moulin Inn. The route is described at walkhighlands. It’s not a high mountain but if it’s snowy, specialist gear and experience will be needed.Caroline WhitingThe Tentsmuir national nature reserve circuit, taking in Tentsmuir Point, covers 7½ miles, largely on surfaced forestry tracks. Start from Lundin Bridge, Tayport, or Morton Lochs car park (£2 parking). Morton Lochs has wildlife hides for watching red squirrels, chaffinches, coal tits and others, and wintering wildfowl, like teal and greylag geese on the water. The sands at Tentsmuir Point host common and grey seals, and thousands of winter wildfowl and waders like pink-footed geese, eider ducks, bar-tailed godwits and oystercatchers. The forest is home to spectacular white-tailed sea eagles, their presence indicated by squabbling gulls or crows.Vicky Inglis This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Binding treaties were discarded, multilateral organisations were denigrated and usurped, international law was ignored, and the authority of the United Nations came under unprecedented challenge. The ideal, encouraged since 1945, of a global community making common cause to right the world’s wrongs faded. In 2018, the ties that bind frayed.Donald Trump appointed himself public enemy number one of the global order. By his words and actions, he undermined the UN, the EU, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the North American Free Trade Agreement.Trump questioned the usefulness of Nato and disrupted its meetings. He withdrew the US from the multilateral 2015 nuclear pact with Iran and, assuming global jurisdiction, vowed to punish anybody who disagreed. When the international court of justice in the Hague outlawed his Iran sanctions, he ignored it. Trump reneged on the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, a key 1987 arms control pact with Russia, quit the UN’s human rights council, cut funding for UN organisations, and trampled on multiple UN resolutions by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Other governments behaved in similarly destructive fashion. Vladimir Putin ignored international demands to reverse Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. Systemic human rights abuses, including disappearances and persecution of the Tatar Muslim minority, went unpunished.Putin colluded with Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons in the war in Syria, in open defiance of the global 1997 UN convention banning their use. The US, UK and France launched one-off missile strikes after a suspected sarin nerve gas attack in Douma, a suburb of Damascus – strikes Moscow condemned as illegal. Russia, Iran and Turkey promoted an alternative Syrian peace process, undermining UN-led talks.Russia mounted a chemical weapons attack, using the novichok nerve agent, in southern England, against a former spy, Sergei Skripal. Its agents tried to hack the international watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons, and Britain’s Foreign Office. Britain demanded the extradition of those responsible for the Salisbury attack. Putin refused. In December, the 70th anniversary of the landmark Universal Declaration of Human Rights passed largely unnoticed and un-celebrated.Russia’s vetoes, backed by fellow permanent member China, again protected Assad against UN war crimes inquiries and immunised Putin’s own actions in Ukraine. China, backed by Russia, blocked action on illegal abuses in Xinjiang and Myanmar. Their obstructionism reduced the UN security council to a state of impotence.Others were guilty, too. The US shielded Israel from UN censure after its forces killed dozens of Palestinians on the Gaza border in May. It later blocked a ceasefire resolution on Yemen. Ignoring the UN convention prohibiting racial discrimination, Israel passed a nationality law institutionalising discrimination against Arabs and non-Jewish minorities.Despite the uproar over the Saudi regime’s murder of Jamal Khashoggi, unlawful and extra-judicial killing by states – notably the US-led campaign to eliminate Islamic State (Isis) terrorists and other presumed extremists in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Sahel – was further normalised in 2018.Independent observers also suffered. Journalists were killed or jailed in growing numbers, reflecting governments’ disregard for freedom of information rights. Academic researchers, such as the Briton Matthew Hedges, who was jailed in the United Arab Emirates, faced intimidation or worse, while dual nationals, such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, were used as pawns in international power games.The global order was further shaken through 2018 by an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the US and China. Trump tore up the rule-book, imposing $200bn worth of tariffs on Beijing, which responded in kind. He also targeted America’s traditional allies, the EU, Canada and Japan.Trump followed his 2017 renunciation of the Paris climate change accord with fresh efforts to disrupt action on reducing carbon emissions in forums such as the G7 and G20. Emissions reached an all-time high in 2018.Naturalist David Attenborough told a climate conference in Poland that the world is “facing a man-made disaster of global scale … The collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”. In October, climate scientists warned global warming could become irreversible in 12 years’ time.Japan endured its highest-ever recorded summer temperatures while snow fell in the Sahara in February. Lethal wildfires devastated parts of California, Sweden and Greece. Huge floods affected China, India and France. Britain shivered under a wind nicknamed “the Beast from the East”.Rightwing populist and nationalist parties, exploiting fears about immigration and identity, raised their profile across Europe and the Balkans. In Italy, a hard-right coalition boosted its popularity by defying the EU on immigration and budget deficits.In Germany, the ruling coalition was humiliated in regional polls in Bavaria and Hesse dominated by anti-immigrant sentiment. Angela Merkel, author of the “open door” policy, announced she would not stand again for chancellor and relinquished her leadership of the Christian Democrats (CDU). Germany got a glimpse of who its next chancellor could be when Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected Merkel’s successor as CDU leader. Elsewhere, far-right parties made gains in Spain and Sweden.In France, Emmanuel Macron, self-styled champion of progressive Europe, struggled to hold the line against Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and “gilets jaunes” protesters angry about taxes and life in general. Britain’s unresolved Brexit drama weakened the ties binding England, Scotland and Wales, further inflaming separatist, nationalist, anti-immigrant and xenophobic sentiments.As Europeans looked inwards, more than 2,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean in 2018 while trying to migrate to Europe, many exploited by smuggling gangs in lawless Libya. The withdrawal of NGO rescue ships, under pressure from EU governments, suggested the toll would rise.In Syria’s seven-year civil war, the brutal siege of Eastern Ghouta finally ended in April with victory for Assad’s forces. Overall, Syria’s regime, assisted by Russia and Iran, reasserted control over most of the country.Pressure mounted on Saudi-backed forces and Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, to end the war in Yemen, which the UN termed the world’s worst humanitarian emergency. The Save the Children charity estimated 85,000 under-fives had starved to death in Yemen since 2015. About 14 million people were at risk from famine.In Afghanistan, ceasefires and concessions failed to halt the violence. While some Taliban leaders appeared ready to talk peace, terrorists linked to Islamic State attacked Kabul. In the Palestine, tensions were unabated following May’s severe Gaza violence. A report in December said Israel had arrested 5,600 Palestinians in the preceding 12 months.The US intensified its war of attrition against Iran, embargoing its oil exports and attempting to isolate it globally. But Tehran’s clerical leadership refused to buckle. The EU sought ways to circumvent the US sanctions, though Tehran did not help its cause by test-firing a new medium-range ballistic missile, a development viewed with concern in London and Paris.In South Africa, Jacob Zuma resigned as president, swept away by a torrent of corruption allegations. A similar fate threatened Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused by the police of bribery and corruption.Nicaragua suffered months of lethal violence as street protesters fought to topple the president and erstwhile Sandinista revolutionary, Daniel Ortega, and his powerful wife, vice-president Rosario Murillo.Zimbabweans also had a torrid time following disputed presidential elections in August. A deepening economic crisis and lack of foreign investment handicapped the first post-Mugabe government. Fears grew that delayed elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo would be neither free nor fair, leading to further destabilisation.In Pakistan, the former cricketer Imran Khan triumphed in national elections only to inherit a debt crisis, border tensions with Afghanistan and India, and an entrenched problem with religious extremism – exemplified by the Asia Bibi blasphemy case.Iraq held elections in May, then spent months deciding who had won. A manual recount was hampered by a fire that destroyed half the ballot papers. Shinzo Abe moved closer to becoming Japan’s longest-serving premier after winning a party leadership election.Australia gained a new leader, Scott Morrison, without a general election, after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted in brutal party in-fighting.

A roe deer darted across the field and a shot rang out.“We’re feeling positive,” said De Magnitot, a farmer, lifelong hunter and mayor of a village in the Val d’Oise. Hunters in France had reason to be happy, he said, because the president, Emmanuel Macron, had given his unabashed support to hunting, promising to strongly promote and protect it as a French way of life.Macron has gone further than any other French president in 40 years to court the hunting lobby and he is pushing through a raft of changes in favour of hunters, including reducing the price of national hunting permits and fixing a new system of monitoring species for hunting.As the gilets jaunes protests hit rural areas, the hunting lobby remains one of Macron’s key links to the countryside and he has refused to give in to environmentalists who criticise his pro-hunting stance.Macron’s popular environment minister Nicolas Hulot quit the government in protest in August, saying he was disgusted that a hunting lobbyist was allowed to attend Élysée Palace meetings. But Macron has insisted there should be no shame in supporting hunting and he has prepared laws to make hunting cheaper and easier, hoping to attract a new, younger generation.“Hunters can now say we have a president who understands us,” said a digital startup developer from the outskirts of Paris who was in the woods hunting wild boar and deer with a bow and arrow.For Macron, who has an image as a moneyed Parisian ex-banker with a city-centre voter base, courting the hunting vote is seen as a way of connecting with the countryside, particularly before European elections next year and local elections in 2020.“Unlike in the UK, hunting in France is not a class issue,” said Thierry Clerc, head of the hunting federation in Île-de-France.The French revolution stripped nobles of their exclusive hunting rights and today many of France’s more than one million hunters are working class, particularly in the south-west and north-east. Hunting in France varies from wild boar and deer to many bird species. Horseback hunting with packs of hounds, although a minority sport, is not banned, unlike in the UK.Macron’s most surprising and symbolic pro-hunting gesture came after dark in a muddy forest during his 40th birthday celebrations last year. The president and his wife, Brigitte, were celebrating at a cottage in the grounds of the vast Renaissance Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, which has long been associated with royal and presidential hunting.During Macron’s stay, top hunters from French federations were stalking deer and wild boar on the estate. One night after the hunters had laid out their kill to admire it, with large wild boar carcasses arranged on beds of leaves, a black car drove up and Macron got out wearing wellies. He spent an hour with the hunters, telling them hunting was a “terrific asset” for French bioersity. “I am the president who will develop hunting, you can count on me,” he said.It was the first time in decades that a French president had dared to openly attend a display of animal carcasses after a hunt. Willy Schraen, head of the national hunters federation, later said Macron had seemed totally at home “even with the mud and blood of dead wild boar”. He added: “It’s a breath of fresh air for our hunters.”Macron does not hunt himself, but he was born in a region where hunting is popular, and his wife’s family are reportedly keen hunters.As well as reducing the cost of national hunting permits from €400 to €200 and changing rules on monitoring species for hunts, Macron has suggested he could reinstate the tradition of presidential hunts at the Château de Chambord. There has been speculation this could begin next year during the French-Italian commemorations of the 500th anniversary of the death of the artist Leonardo da Vinci, who spent his final years in France.Bougrain Dubourg said he feared Macron’s changes to the way hunted species are monitored could result in more species being killed: “It’s unacceptable and undemocratic for Macron to be doing this without consulting bioersity groups.” He said France already allowed the hunting of several bird species in danger of dying out.Thierry Coste, the hunting lobbyist whose presence at an Elysée meeting sparked the environment minister’s resignation in August, was unrepentant. Sitting in a smart cafe in Paris, he said he had previously advised the former presidents Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, “But Emmanuel Macron is the only one with whom I have this kind of incredible complicity – he understands everything: that hunting is part of French rural identity and that it’s not a taboo.”Coste said France remained an “Eldorado for hunting” and Macron’s new rules would not endanger species.Jérôme Fourquet, a political scientist from the pollsters Ifop who has studied the hunting vote, said: “Macron, who comes across as a representative of city people with university degrees, has a support deficit in rural France. Hunting representatives convinced him that one way to reach the rural population was through hunting.”French hunters and their families make up a significant pool of voters and they once fielded their own candidate in presidential elections. Some hunters historically voted Communist, but now the vote is spread between the left, the mainstream right, and increasingly, Marine Le Pen’s far right.But Fourquet said the difficulty would come when Macron was forced to reconcile the need to reach out to centre-left, Green voters in cities at the same time as hunters. “They are complete opposites and that’s where it becomes a challenge.”The hard-left France Insoumise group in parliament has been pushing to ban hunting on Sundays, citing accidents in which people have been shot. But hunters have many allies among different parties in the parliament and senate. Two of Macron’s current cabinet ministers are hunters.Meanwhile, Macron knows he cannot take the hunting vote for granted. “I’m not sure Macron knows what a gun is,” said one sceptical rightwing hunter in the woods west of Paris. “He seems to be listening to his wife, whose family hunts. That’s good for us hunters now, but we’ll stay vigilant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd2d32c5e1c5839a4664ca5dd780966c3c44b36/0_246_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b005f245927e5c273b779678903de9de","title":"destruction gets more likes indonesias tsunami selfie seekers","story":"A field overlooking the Sunda Strait full of tsunami debris has become an unlikely spot for tourist photosSolihat and her three friends had everything sorted for their perfect selfie, ready to be taken by the beach in Indonesia’s Banten province.Their hijabs were striking: one pink, one green. One of the gang was ready with a ‘V’ finger peace sign. And most importantly, in the background was a scene of utter carnage: a flooded field scattered with cars and farm equipment smashed up by the tsunami that devastated the province’s coast on Saturday night, killing almost 500 people.The field, full of floating detritus and overlooking the choppy waves of the Sunda Strait, is now a graveyard for farm vehicles previously stored in a huge barn, that were swept away by the deadly waves. Since then it has been visited by a stream of Indonesian selfie-seekers, many travelling for hours to share online photos of themselves at the site of the tsunami, which was caused by land shifting on the nearby volcano Anak Krakatoa.Solihat, 40, said she had travelled two hours to the site from the city of Cilegon. She and her friends from a Cilegon women’s Islamic group took clothing donations for people displaced by the tsunami. “The photo is on Facebook as proof that we are really here and gave the aid,” she said.She added that despite many people viewing selfies as shallow, her unusual choice of photo background showed depth. “When people see photos of destruction they realise that they’re in a better place. Pictures of destruction will get more likes. Maybe it’s because it reminds people to be grateful.”Since Saturday’s disaster, many dead bodies have been washed up on the same short stretch of beach and road that the selfie spot field is located on. With 154 people in the wider tsunami zone still unaccounted for, many search and rescue vehicles tasked with grim duties drove past the selfie takers yesterday.When asked if it was appropriate to be taking selfies in front of a body of water that could be hiding undiscovered corpses, Solihat said: “It depends on your intention. If you take selfies for showing off, then don’t do it. But if you do it to share grief with other people, it’s OK.”Not many of the selfie-takers crowding the field yesterday struck poses suggesting that they were attempting to share grief. One woman in army-style camouflage clothes spent half an hour wading around the middle of the field in knee-length water, seemingly to get closer to the crumpled SUV at the centre of the field, to better take a selfie with it. The owner of the car, Bahrudin, 40, head of the local farmers’ union, was not impressed with the photo tourists. Standing in the water in a pair of yellow wellington boots, he repeatedly said the word “Disappointed” when asked what he thought of the field’s new social media fame.Valentina Anastasia, 18, from central Java, was not disappointed with her decision to leave Jakarta where she was on holiday and make the three-hour car journey to Banten. “I want to see the destruction and the people affected,” she said.When asked how many selfies she had taken in the area she laughed heartily. “A lot! For social media, WhatsApp groups...”. She scrolled through a cascade of selfies on her phone, revealing many with a mutilated, partly-submerged yellow digger vehicle in the background."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62d7a6878e9d8d597eff411bc27be86e000cdcf/0_0_2573_1544/master/2573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7306a9eb0d1b159f09e09a0aa54db2","title":"expedition scientists map larsen c ice shelf weddell calving ","story":"Scientists head to Weddell Sea to model changes to the shelf since the calving, in 2017, of the massive iceberg A68In the comings days, a team of scientists, technicians and other specialists will gather onboard the SA Agulhas II, a 13,500-tonne ice-breaker moored off the coast of Antarctica, and make final preparations for one of the most ambitious polar expeditions in decades.Guided by satellite imagery and drones flown from the research ship, the vessel will set off on New Year’s day through the pack ice of the Weddell Sea, part of the Southern Ocean in the Antarctic. The ship’s destination is the Larsen C ice shelf where a trillion tonne iceberg, four times the size of Greater London, calved away in July 2017.Antarctica has a way of dashing even the best laid plans. But if the Weddell Sea expedition can reach the Larsen C ice shelf, the fourth largest on the continent, the researchers will have an unprecedented chance to study how it and others like it melt, fracture and collapse, and what life ekes out an existence in the sheltered waters beneath.But there is more to the expedition than science. The Weddell Sea is infamous in Antarctic history as the place where, in 1915, Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance became trapped in ice for 10 months. The crushed vessel finally sank in more than two miles of water.One the way home, pack ice permitting, the Agulhas will head for the spot where Endurance went down and, for the first time, hunt for the wreckage with autonomous robotic submarines.“Antarctica is a place of extremes. You never know what the conditions will be like,” said Julian Dowdeswell, director of the Scott Polar Research Institute, in Cambridge, and chief scientist on the Weddell Sea expedition. “But if we are that close to one of the most iconic vessels in polar exploration, we have got to go and look for it.”So far, satellite images of the Weddell Sea show that ice coverage is low for the time of year, tipping the odds in favour of the Agulhas reaching its goal. The massive iceberg, known as A68, which broke off the Larsen C ice shelf is helping out too. There is a clockwise gyre in the Weddell Sea that brings sea ice west and north, but the iceberg has swung out to block the flow, leaving the northern waters clearer for expedition’s approach.If the expedition reaches the Larsen C ice shelf, researchers will launch two autonomous robotic submarines which will e under the ice and map the shelf with upward-looking sonar. Scientists will look out for cavities in the underside of the ice, created when the relatively warm sea water melts the shelf from beneath. Coupled with measurements of sea temperature and salinity, the data will be fed into computer models showing ice shelf melt, fracture and collapse.Ice shelves form when inland glaciers bearing ice that has built up over thousands of years reach the coast and extend over the water. Some can go hundreds of miles offshore. Because ice shelves themselves are floating, sea levels are not directly affected when they melt or collapse. Instead, the ice shelves act as buttresses and when they disintegrate the glaciers on the land flow more quickly into the sea. The glaciers held at bay by the Larsen C ice shelf contain enough ice to raise global sea levels by about 10cm.The robotic submarines will also map the seabed under the ice shelf with downward-looking sonar. If the Larsen C ice shelf has disintegrated before as part of a natural cycle of growth and collapse, researchers should find scars called “ploughmarks” on the seafloor, created as the icebergs are dragged around by ocean currents. No ploughmarks will be bad news: it will suggest that the recent breakup of the Larsen C shelf is unprecedented over the past 20,000 years.The east coast of the Antarctic peninsula once had four main ice shelves, named Larsen A, B, C and D. The Larsen A and B shelves collapsed in weeks during 1995 and 2002 respectively. “With those already gone and with A68 cleaving off Larsen C, there is a concern something similar may happen there,” said John Shears, the expedition’s voyage leader. “It could be a precursor for something big.”If the seafloor is clear of the huge boulders that glaciers have a habit of dragging to the sea, the robotic submarines will e down and film the sea bed for the biologists on the expedition. The submarines may spot starfish, brittle stars, corals and sponges, and perhaps the odd passing toothfish.Lucy Woodall, lead biologist on the expedition and principal scientist at the Nekton Oxford Deep Ocean Research Institute, whose mission is to explore and conserve the ocean, said: “We have so little information about anything that is living on the seafloor, or under the sea ice, that every bit of biology is going to be interesting to us. It is easy to think the days of exploration are over – and they sort of are in the terrestrial world, but in the marine world they still very much exist.”On the home leg of the 45-day expedition, the team will decide whether to look for Shackleton’s lost Endurance. The Agulhas will probably have to break ice for several days to reach the spot where the doomed ship sank. If they get there the water has to be clear enough to launch the robotic submarines without risk of losing them.“We’d love to get to the wreck site, but it’ll be a challenge even in a light ice year,” said Shears. “No one has ever got close. If it was easy to do someone would have done it a long time ago.”Dowdeswell is confident that if they can only find a route through the ice the vessel will be theirs to discover. “If we can get there with the ship we have quite a good chance of finding the Endurance. It would be the most memorable event in my career.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eb18d0b99df8ce67ebcd945b56a260641ad35d/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584fa537a5d2b8e83af557d5ccdb3781","title":"mount etna magnitude earthquake italy sicily","story":"Tremor near Catania injures four people, damages buildings and causes partial road closureAn ongoing eruption of Mount Etna, Europe’s biggest and most active volcano, has triggered a 4.8-magnitude earthquake that injured four people and damaged buildings in the early hours of Wednesday.The quake was the biggest since the volcano came to life again on Monday with hundreds of small and medium tremors and causing lava spewing from a new fissure. The resulting ash cloud led to the temporary closure of Sicilian airspace on Christmas Eve.The Italian national institute for geophysics and volcanology (INGV) said the quake, which struck at 3.19am, was 1km deep. The epicentre was to the north of the port city of Catania and the damage caused several families to spend the night in the streets.Four people sustained light injuries, officials said, and two people were rescued from a collapsed building. Frightened residents rushed out of their homes as the tremors hit. In the small town of Pennisi, in the province of Catania, a statue of Sant’Emidio, a protector against earthquakes, collapsed in the main square.Monday’s eruption occurred on the side of Mount Etna and was the first lateral eruption in a decade. The 3,300-metre volcano has erupted frequently in the past 2,700 years. Its most recent occurred in spring 2017, and its last big eruption in early 2009.Experts from INGV, who were summoned to an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning, said they were closely monitoring the situation and would release further details during the day.Marco Neri, an expert in volcanology and a member of INGV, said: “The recent seismic activity caused by the ongoing eruption is not unusual but potentially dangerous.”Eugenio Privitera, director of INGV in Catania, said: “We cannot exclude fractures at a low level. This strong seismic activity is worrying. It reminds me to the eruption in 1984 that killed one man.”Gaetano Maenza, a member of the Italian professional association of nature and interpretive guide, who lives in a town a few miles from the volcano, told the : “Tremors during eruptions are pretty normal here. What is unusual is the level of magnitude triggered by Etna. I have no memory of such intensity. It was scary.”An increase in seismic activity this month has also shaken the area around Vesuvius, the large volcano in the Gulf of Naples. It is populated by 3 million people, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Compulsory retirement age of most public servants recruited before 2004 will increaseSex workers in Ireland forced to move or stay in unsuitable accommodation, activists sayPolice took papers unrelated to investigation into film on murders of six men in 1994PSNI appeal for witnesses to come forward after man set upon on Tuesday morningAttraction was forced to shut for three days in August during the visit of Pope FrancisFire was reported at well-known pub on John Street at 9am on Christmas Day\u0026lsquoFortunately, many children contact Childline to share their thoughts and feelings\u0026rsquoGarda operation sees 11 bikes seized, two of which were found to be stolenIncreasingly popular tradition saw beaches, coastal rocks and lakes packed with bathersTwo baby girls among Dublin hospital\u0026rsquos overnight arrivalsKnights of St Columbanus serve three-course meal to homeless families and those in needFrancis sends Cardinal to Iraq to celebrate with the country\u0026rsquos long-suffering ChristiansSanta will be breathalysed before journey to make sure he is well under legal drink-flying alcohol limitThis year marks 60 years of unbroken UN peacekeeping service for Defence Forces\u0026lsquoNobody is listening, they keep building dormitories,\u0026rsquo says homelessness campaignerLiterary correspondent critically injured in single-vehicle crash 4km outside Drogheda\u0026lsquoGrand oasis in the big vastness of space\u0026rsquo: \u0026lsquoEarthrise\u0026rsquo captured by Apollo 8 astronaut\u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot stand around chatting in your togs\u0026rsquo: Practical tips from Irish Water SafetySome 36 applications for return of a child were made from Ireland last year.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThird generation fruit and vegetable wholesaler Justin Leonard believes Simon Coveney’s no-deal Brexit plans are “disingenuous” and too little too late.  Photograph: Enda O’Dowd“The problem is nobody knows,” says fruit and vegetable wholesaler Justin Leonard about what kind of Brexit there might be, hard or soft, and what either might mean for his business.Leonard is the fourth-generation of his family to run Jackie Leonard \u0026amp Sons, a 126-year-old fruit and veg wholesaler, Dublin’s oldest. Brexit could have a major effect on Irish fruit and veg importers such as Leonard and others in the Fruit Market in Dublin’s north inner city.Some 90 per cent of the fruits Leonard sells come from Europe and at least 50 per cent of the vegetables are sourced from mainland Europe or the UK. Even 20 per cent of his potatoes come from the UK.“If we have a hard Brexit, all our product we source in Northern Ireland – mushrooms, cooking apples from Co Armagh, juices – they are all going to become non-EU products,” he said.“It is not going to be a case of jumping in your car and coming down the M1 across the Border from the North. Nobody knows what will happen. Nobody can legislate for what will happen.”Leonard says the Government cannot say for certain what they may or may not be implementing yet to prepare for Brexit, and there are fewer than 100 days until the UK leaves the EU at the end of March.He believes Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is being a “little disingenuous” by saying that the purchase of land at Dublin Port by the end of March would “solve the problem of a backlog of trucks”.“We are in the 11th hour and suddenly everyone is saying, ‘Let’s put a plan together’. It doesn’t happen like that,” he says.He is concerned that customs clearance agents, who mostly vanished with the disappearance of borders in the 1990s with the opening of the EU single market, will not return in time to deal with Brexit.“We are not going to suddenly materialise customs clearance agents overnight and definitely not by March 31st,” he says.Fruit importers fear what customs checks might mean to the fruit and veg being brought into the country on the backs of trucks and the effect of a possible return of days-long delays at borders.Philip Fitzpatrick of Caterway fruit and veg wholesalers says restrictions on the UK land-bridge route to Europe would mean taking the longer, direct ferries, which face a greater risk of delays from stormy weather.“We are hoping there will be some kind of deal, obviously, and we will be able to keep the land bridge. But if there is not, we will have to look for a direct ferry,” he said.In this business, quick deliveries are everything longer journeys mean possible rotten produce.“You are talking about fresh products, and if it is delayed, it goes off,” said Maurice Lawlor, who has been working in the family business J\u0026ampN Lawlor Fruit Merchants for 42 years.“The quality of the product when it hits the shops might not be as good as what it is now.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Frank RobinchonEPAJapan will resume commercial whaling from July in its waters and exclusive economic zone while ending its controversial hunts in the Antarctic, it said on Wednesday, as it announced its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC).Australia and New Zealand welcomed the decision to abandon the Antarctic whale hunt, but expressed disappointment that Japan would engage in any killing of the ocean mammals.The decision, some experts said, allows Japan to save the money it spends to support Antarctic whaling while taking a tough pro-whaling stance – a matter of national pride for some conservatives.But doubts exist about whether Japanese commercial whaling can be economically viable, especially as fewer people than ever are eating whale meat, they said.“From July 2019, after the withdrawal comes into effect on June 30th, Japan will conduct commercial whaling within Japan’s territorial sea and its exclusive economic zone, and will cease the take of whales in the Antarctic Oceanthe Southern Hemisphere,” chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a statement announcing the decision.“The whaling will be conducted in accordance with international law and within the catch limits calculated in accordance with the method adopted by the IWC to avoid negative impact on cetacean resources,” he said.Japan, which says most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its culture, has long campaigned without success for the IWC to allow commercial whaling.Some influential politicians’ constituencies include whaling communities, and prime minister Shinzo Abe’s election district is home to the whaling port of Shimonoseki.The decision to withdraw from the IWC followed its latest rejection of Japan’s bid to resume commercial whaling at a September meeting, which Suga said showed it was impossible to bridge the gap between whaling advocates and anti-whaling members.The resumption of commercial whaling is an unusual decision for Japan, which stresses multilateralism in its diplomacy, and it sparked swift criticism from environmental groups and others who believe all whales should be protected.“The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures,” international conservationist group Greenpeace said.“The Japanese government needs to recommit to the IWC and prioritise new measures for marine conservation.”Yoshie Nakatani, an official at the foreign ministry’s fisheries ision, said Japan would still attend IWC meetings.“It’s not like we are turning our back on the IWC and abandoning international co-operation,” she said. “There is no change to our country’s respect for the rule of law and multilateralism.”New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters welcomed Japan’s decision to halt Antarctic whaling but said he was disappointed with the decision to resume any commercial whaling.“Whaling is an outdated and unnecessary practice. We continue to hope Japan eventually reconsiders its position and will cease all whaling in order to advance the protection of the ocean’s ecosystems,” Mr Peters said in a statement.Australia urged Japan to return to the IWC.“Australia remains resolutely opposed to all forms of commercial and so-called scientific whaling,” its environment minister, Melissa Price, and foreign minister, Marise Payne, said in a statement.Japan has long defied such protests to conduct what it calls scientific research whaling, having repeatedly said its ultimate goal was to whale commercially again.In 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan should halt its Antarctic whaling.Japan suspended its hunt for one season to re-tool its whaling programme with measures such as cutting the number of whales and species targeted, but resumed hunting in the 2015-2016 season, capping its Antarctic catch with a quota of 333 whales annually.Japan began scientific whaling in 1987, a year after an international whaling moratorium began. Its aged whaling mothership is in need of a costly replacement or refit.Much of the meat ends up in shops, even though most Japanese no longer eat it. Whale consumption accounted for 0.1 per cent of all Japanese meat consumption, according to the Asahi newspaper. That works out to 35 grams per person per year, according to a whale meat shop owner Koichi Matsumoto.“We ate whale meat in the old days but there are lots of other things to eat now,” said a 75-year-old woman shopper.“But if we don’t explain internationally that whales are increasing . . . people won’t understand,” she added.The ever-dwindling demand means an uncertain outlook for Japan’s whaling.“It could persist as a small-scale activity. There are still whale meat restaurants and I think some people will keep eating a small quantity,” said Yoichiro Sato, a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University.“(But) if it’s too expensive, people will not eat it. As an industry, its prospect is very grim.”–Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Some raised warnings about what they were seeing on the ground.  Officials evacuate bodies from South LampungRizal Alimin, a doctor working for NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap based at a local school turned temporary shelter, said: “A lot of the children are sick with fevers, headaches and they haven\u0027t had enough water. Harmensyah, one of those involved in the disaster relief effort, said: “I understand if some refugee groups don’t get food but the most important thing for us is to save lives and evacuate the bodies before they start to decompose.”Riefian Fajarsyah the lead singer of Seventeen - a band that was struck by the tsunami mid-concert - buried his wife, Dylan Sahara on Tuesday.On Instagram, he wrote: Please send prayers for my wife Dylan so she will be at peace.  Fajarsyah, the only surviving member of the band, apologised for missing the funerals of his dead friends while searching for his wife. Be peaceful there, guys, Fajarsyah wrote in a series of posts on social media. We will not forget you, and we will keep sending our prayers. See you. Until next time.Rescuers are working in an atmosphere of fear amid concern that the ongoing volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau could set off another tsunami, with high swells triggering false alarms and a partial evacuation of journalists and NGO workers earlier today. Indonesian authorities are coordinating the delivery of vital aid via land and sea, with Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the national disaster agency’s public relations center, tweeting videos today showing medical supply boats and rescue ships en route to the disaster-struck coasts of West Java and Southern Sumatra. How the tsunami was causedMeanwhile, the Tanjung Lesung Beach Hotel has emerged as a scene of utter devastation. More than 100 people have so far been found dead on its grounds, the death toll accumulating by several dozen each day, according to the resort’s safety manager, who asked to be identified only as Ronny.Ronny was forced to watch as a series of four massive surges, one as high as the gazebo, swept away everyone involved in a family gathering for members of the state-run power company PLN from a beachfront resort. The site was popular for its views of Krakatoa, but the placement of a company banner obscured the view out to the sea, ensuring the crowd had no warning of the wave-strike. PLN staffer Didiek Fauzi Dahlan told of being smashed 500 metres in the initial swell, clawing at coconut trees before being washed up momentarily on a roof, only to be re-submerged when the structure collapsed beneath him. Indonesia tsunami after eruption - in picturesIn the dark and the cold of the waves, Mr Dahlan struggled to find his family, tracing the voice of his eldest daughter Narnia to rescue her, before tiredness and warnings of another wave forced him to abandon the search. “I just gave up,” he told The Daily . I expected I would meet my wife and my youngest the next morning.” The next day, Mr Dahlan’s driver discovered the bodies of his employer’s wife and child among those left behind by the tide.Elsewhere, coincidence and decisions made in the midst of blind panic proved to be the difference between life and death.  Pure chance caused 32-year-old housewife Sutini to look up from her efforts to calm her sick two-year-old son, Wahyu, and spot the onrushing wave.Before she’d even made it up and out of the room of her beach house, the water was racing by her window, pulsating past as she tried and repeatedly failed to open her front door. Her eventual decision to abandon the attempt and cast her kids and herself out through the window, likely saved their lives.Please review our commenting policyAmazon’s Alexa suffers outages on Christmas Day as device appeared to cope with onslaught of new usersComment: Labour is playing the class card with its obsessive pursuit of hunting Mount Etna volcano triggers 4.8 magnitude quake in Sicily, ItalySajid Javid defends government\u0026#39s right to send Pakistani sex abusers homeJapan to resume commercial whaling next year after pulling out of IWCComment: Now the sales have become irrelevant, Boxing Day is a true moment of emancipationComment: We must not allow a misguided political correctness to stop us from helping persecuted ChristiansDonald Trump fails to diminish girl\u0026#39s belief in Father ChristmasGuatemalan boy, 8, dies in US border control custody over ChristmasCountry Life breaks \u0026#39no nudity\u0026#39 pledge for Girls in Pearls feature, as Kiko Matthews says naked photoshoot was \u0026#39empowering\u0026#39Town centres to receive £675m cash injection under Government plans to save Britain\u0026#39s high streets Tubby football fans will be urged to train at their local stadiumBritain must do more to protect persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Jeremy Hunt saysAll smiles as \u0026#39Fab 4\u0026#39 put on united front at Sandringham Christmas service UK\u0026#39s biggest library of plants under threat from biscuit beetles as RHS freeze pest off leaves before cataloging themRoyal Opera House to join the #MeToo era as it challenges misogyny on stage by asking: \u0026#39Does opera  hate women?\u0026#39Revealed: The new calorie limits on every common food to reduce obesityDonald Trump wants UK-US trade deal done by 2020 election, reveals congressmanSpeaker John Bercow has received more than £70,000 in freebies,  can reveal We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"impossible view birth jesus christ cool detached lens science","story":"The more you understand about the birth of Christ, the more you believeI dread to think how Christmas will be marked in a hundred years’ time, by when most people will be totally ignorant of how it all began. “What happened on the very first Christmas, children?”“John McClane pushed Hans Gruber off the Nakatomi Tower.”“Merry Christmas and a yippee-ki-yay to you!”This is pure fantasy, of course: no one will be called Mrs in 2118.The desire to detach things from their inner, more complicated meaning is a Western tic.

We will not hunt in the Antarctic waters or in the southern hemisphere, Mr Suga added.Tokyo has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the body, and has been regularly criticised for catching hundreds of whales a year for scientific research despite being a signatory to a moratorium on hunting the animals.Mr Suga said Japan would officially inform the IWC of its decision by the end of the year, which will mean the withdrawal comes into effect by June 30.Leaving the IWC means Japanese whalers will be able to resume hunting in Japanese coastal waters of minke and other whales currently protected by the IWC.But Japan will not be able to continue the so-called scientific research hunts in the Antarctic that it has been exceptionally allowed as an IWC member under the Antarctic Treaty.The withdrawal means Japan joins Iceland and Norway in openly defying the IWC\u0027s ban on commercial whale hunting.Whale sashimi is pictured at Japanese whale meat restaurant in TokyoJapan has hunted whales for centuries, and the meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-World War II years when the country was desperately poor.But consumption has declined significantly in recent decades, with much of the population saying they rarely or never eat whale meat.Whale hunting has become a rare thorny subject in Japan\u0027s otherwise largely amiable foreign policy, with international opposition only serving to make conservatives dig in deeper in support of the tradition.Many members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s conservative Liberal Democratic Party are supporters of whaling, and he himself comes from a constituency where whale hunting remains popular.Tokyo argues that whaling is an important part of Japan\u0027s traditions, and Mr Suga said the withdrawal would allow fishermen to pass our country\u0027s rich whaling culture onto the next generation.In September, Tokyo sought to convince the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling, arguing that stocks of certain species were now sufficient to support renewed hunting.A minke whale is unloaded at a port after a whaling for scientific purposes in KushiroBut the bid failed, with strong opposition from anti-whaling nations - led by Australia, the European Union and the United States.Activist groups slammed the decision, with Greenpeace calling it a sneaky announcement.The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures, said Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan.The IWC, established in 1946 to conserve and manage the world\u0027s whale and cetacean population, introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986.Tokyo has long exploited a loophole allowing whales to be killed for scientific research and says it is trying to prove the population is large enough to sustain a return to commercial hunting.It makes no secret of the fact that meat from the expeditions ends up on dinner tables.There have been no concessions from countries who only place importance on the protection of whales, Mr Suga said.At the IWC general meeting in September this year, it became evident once again that those supporting the sustainable use of whale stocks and those supporting protection cannot co-exist, leading us to this conclusion.Please review our commenting policyAmazon’s Alexa suffers outages on Christmas Day as device appeared to cope with onslaught of new usersComment: Labour is playing the class card with its obsessive pursuit of hunting Mount Etna volcano triggers 4.8 magnitude quake in Sicily, ItalySajid Javid defends government\u0026#39s right to send Pakistani sex abusers homeComment: Now the sales have become irrelevant, Boxing Day is a true moment of emancipationComment: We must not allow a misguided political correctness to stop us from helping persecuted ChristiansDonald Trump fails to diminish girl\u0026#39s belief in Father ChristmasClean water and medical supplies dwindling in aftermath of devastating Indonesia tsunamiGuatemalan boy, 8, dies in US border control custody over ChristmasCountry Life breaks \u0026#39no nudity\u0026#39 pledge for Girls in Pearls feature, as Kiko Matthews says naked photoshoot was \u0026#39empowering\u0026#39Town centres to receive £675m cash injection under Government plans to save Britain\u0026#39s high streets Tubby football fans will be urged to train at their local stadiumBritain must do more to protect persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Jeremy Hunt saysAll smiles as \u0026#39Fab 4\u0026#39 put on united front at Sandringham Christmas service UK\u0026#39s biggest library of plants under threat from biscuit beetles as RHS freeze pest off leaves before cataloging themRoyal Opera House to join the #MeToo era as it challenges misogyny on stage by asking: \u0026#39Does opera  hate women?\u0026#39Revealed: The new calorie limits on every common food to reduce obesityDonald Trump wants UK-US trade deal done by 2020 election, reveals congressmanSpeaker John Bercow has received more than £70,000 in freebies,  can reveal We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mount etna volcano triggers 48 magnitude quake sicily italy","story":"A quake triggered by Mount Etna\u0027s ongoing eruption jolted eastern Sicily before dawn Wednesday, slightly injuring 10 people and prompting frightened Italian villagers to flee their homes.Italy\u0027s Civil Protection officials said the quake, which struck at 3:19 a.m., was part of a swarm of some 1,000 tremors, most of them barely perceptible, linked to Etna\u0027s volcanic eruption this week.The quake struck north of Catania, the largest city in the eastern part of the Mediterranean island, but no injuries or damages were reported there. Italy\u0027s national seismology institute said it registered a magnitude of 4.8 and occurred at a relatively shallow depth, 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) under the mountain\u0027s surface.The temblor damaged some rural homes, including structures that had been abandoned years ago, toppled a Madonna statue in a church in the town of Santa Venerina and opened up cracks on a highway, which was closed for inspection, Rai state radio said.One 80-year-old man was safely extracted from the rubble of his home, the Italian news agency ANSA said.A woman told state radio that a heavy armoire in her home had toppled over, trapping her sister, who was then safely pulled out by her father. In another house, a ceiling collapsed.Etna remains a dangerous volcano, and this country of ours is unfortunately fragile, government undersecretary Vito Crimi said, adding there were no fatalities and 10 slight injuries.The quake was also felt in the upscale Sicilian resort town of Taormina.The Civil Protection agency said temporary shelters were being set up for people whose houses were damaged or who were too alarmed to return to their homes.In recent days, Etna\u0027s latest eruption has been shooting volcanic ash, heavy smoke and lava stones into the air, coating roads and homes nearby with ash. A new fracture has opened near Etna\u0027s southeast crater and lava has been flowing down an uninhabited slope.Etna, the largest of Italy\u0027s three active volcanoes, has been particularly active since July. Amazon’s Alexa suffers outages on Christmas Day as device appeared to cope with onslaught of new usersComment: Labour is playing the class card with its obsessive pursuit of hunting Sajid Javid defends government\u0026#39s right to send Pakistani sex abusers homeJapan to resume commercial whaling next year after pulling out of IWCComment: We must not allow a misguided political correctness to stop us from helping persecuted ChristiansComment: Now the sales have become irrelevant, Boxing Day is a true moment of emancipationDonald Trump fails to diminish girl\u0026#39s belief in Father ChristmasClean water and medical supplies dwindling in aftermath of devastating Indonesia tsunamiGuatemalan boy, 8, dies in US border control custody over ChristmasCountry Life breaks \u0026#39no nudity\u0026#39 pledge for Girls in Pearls feature, as Kiko Matthews says naked photoshoot was \u0026#39empowering\u0026#39Town centres to receive £675m cash injection under Government plans to save Britain\u0026#39s high streets Tubby football fans will be urged to train at their local stadiumBritain must do more to protect persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Jeremy Hunt saysAll smiles as \u0026#39Fab 4\u0026#39 put on united front at Sandringham Christmas service UK\u0026#39s biggest library of plants under threat from biscuit beetles as RHS freeze pest off leaves before cataloging themRoyal Opera House to join the #MeToo era as it challenges misogyny on stage by asking: \u0026#39Does opera  hate women?\u0026#39Revealed: The new calorie limits on every common food to reduce obesityDonald Trump wants UK-US trade deal done by 2020 election, reveals congressmanSpeaker John Bercow has received more than £70,000 in freebies,  can reveal We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/12/22/TELEMMGLPICT000149780368_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoNNSexKcI53-HHJW8z5oHN2zu8eE3xlap_UxrZYPcsw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"must not allow misguided political correctness stop us helping","story":"The Church of the Nativity in BethlehemYesterday, my family and I walked the short journey to our local church, and enjoyed an uplifting Christmas service.

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the withdrawal agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the international trade secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?Other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the cost-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.If we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s common external tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonisation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.Finally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”I can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally.

A redesign sets out to show that to consumersClick to followThe IndependentWorkers at Suma in Elland, YorkshireWhen Sheree Hatton started working at the whole foods distributor Suma six years ago, she knew it was different to anywhere else she’d ever worked.Hatton lives in Halifax with her husband and young son. In her previous job in advertising and sales for a newspaper, she was\u0026nbspused to a hierarchical business with targets for workers. Suma,\u0026nbspa worker’s co-op where each employee owns a share of the business, offered her a chance to have a say in everything from overall strategy to day-to-day operations.\u0026nbspEating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Organic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I knew Suma was different from what I had been used to,” Hatton says. “But the more I learned about co-ops, the more I realised that by feeding into business decisions\u0026nbspyou have an equal opportunity to say how the business should be run.”Suma is known as the largest whole food distributor in the UK. But fewer people know that Suma is also Britain’s biggest workers co-operative, with an annual turnover of £55m. More than 200 people now work at Suma after rapid growth in the last few years.\u0026nbspAll of them are considered equal. Every worker at Suma is paid the same salary of £33,000. They get the opportunity to work in every part of the business – including the canteen kitchen – on rotation at the company offices in Elland, Yorkshire. And they get to vote on business decisions. “We are an equal business and we’re very proud of what we’re doing here,” Hatton says.\u0026nbspBut customers, like Hatton, often aren’t instantly aware of Suma’s co-operative status or what that means, according to a survey they commissioned in 2017. “One of the embarrassing points was that not everyone knew that we are a co-op,” Hatton says. So in 2017, Suma workers decided it was time for a rebrand.\u0026nbspSuma was started over 40 years ago in the kitchen of a house in Leeds. Reg Taylor, owner of a small retail shop, proposed at a meeting attended by other wholefood shops in the north of England that they set up a wholesaling co-operative, to supply to each other, in 1975.The name Suma was first used when the business moved to a lock-up garage in Leeds. In 1977, the business was sold to seven employees who became the founder members of the Triangle Wholefoods Collective Ltd, trading as Suma.Suma has recently benefited as consumers have become more conscious of their health and the ethics of food, plus the growing popularity of veganism. The business introduced its own vegan line in September 2017. New vegan products, including the 2018 introductions of meat-free mini-burgers in tins, have helped sales grow in the last decade.Suma now sells over 7,000 products. The branding has evolved\u0026nbsphaphazardly as lines have been added. Workers knew from customer feedback that they needed a redesign to create a single identity across all ranges, including essential, body and home. Designers also wanted to position Suma at the forefront of the new movement for sustainability and contemporary food.“We really wanted to show off that it was a co-op,” says Harriet Ferguson, senior designer at Pearlfisher, the agency commissioned to do the work. “The existing identity didn’t really do that.” Pearlfisher designers added a tagline to the logo\u0026nbsp“Co-op since 1977” to make Suma distinctive against competition against younger brands. Then they designed a logo out of different shapes to show the different personalities in the co-op.“We called this our Suma of parts and used these shapes to create the logo type. This\u0026nbspdynamic pattern can be used on the packaging at\u0026nbspdifferent levels,” Ferguson says.Suma’s inhouse design team picked some of the trickiest products for Pearlfisher to work on in the redesign, including fiddly products with small labels, like pate tubes, and some that didn’t obviously fit into one range, like coconut products.Pearlfisher turned their designs into a set of packs for Suma’s inhouse designers to roll out across old and new lines. The agency also introduced colour palettes to make different products more identifiable. They used earthy tones for the basic products, simple colours for unprocessed food and bright, natural colours for processed pastas and peanut butter. For the premium products, like speciality coffee, they used a charcoal colour palette with pops of colour.The most important thing, says David Jenkinson, creative designer at Pearlfisher, was creating a sense of the collective in all the elements. “The new identity embodies the idea that this is a collective of iniduals,” he says. “They are aligned, they sing from the same hymn sheet, but they are different.”The new\u0026nbspcolourful logo, with its tessellating shapes, will be seen on lorries up and down the country and on tins and tubes of Suma products in wholefood stockists\u0026nbspfrom January.\u0026nbspWhole Foods releases its 2019 list of new food trendsA key part of Hatton’s job has been communicating the new design to staff internally. In a company where 200 people can vote on every small change, Suma needed a process to make sure the redesign wasn’t delayed by disagreements. “We didn’t want 200 people deciding what colours to use!” says Hatton. Instead the branding team built a case for the rebrand and wrote a business plan. They took the plan to workers, who voted it through. Then the designers were free to make decisions, with in-house work making sure workers were happy with the results.“It’s probably been a little slower, just generally because we’re trying to get consensus and make sure people are behind everything before we proceed,” Hatton says. Some longstanding members wanted to stick with the existing designs, because they saw that it had worked. Hatton and other Suma members listened to them and tried to alleviate any concerns. “In a typical commercial industry people just get told what is happening,” she says. “The difference is that we want people to be passionate about it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme.

Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities.

Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers.

That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years.

The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The 41-year-old, whose speech will compete with the Queen‘s just after\u0026nbsp3pm, also opens up about the experience of growing up without a father figure.\u0026nbsp“My dad… he weren’t around when I was a kid. And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. “In light of recent ethical questions raised surrounding my casting as Dante ‘Tex’ Gill, I have decided to respectfully withdraw my participation in the project,” the actor said. “Our cultural understanding of transgender people continues to advance, and I’ve learned a lot from the community since making my first statement about my casting and realise it was insensitive.”Criss recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of real-life killer Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace.His comments contrast with those of Cate Blanchett, who in October defended straight actors playing gay characters.The Academy Award winner said she will “fight to the death” for the right to suspend disbelief.She disagrees with the idea that a performer can only form a deep bond with a character if they have shared experiences and believes it defies the point of acting.Blanchett, who played a lesbian in 2015’s Carol, said: “It also speaks to something that I’m quite passionate about in storytelling generally, but in film specifically, which is that film can be quite a literal medium.Additional reporting by AgenciesSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Infinity-O screen has already been used on the Samsung Galaxy A8, meaning the other three could be used in the three expected variants of the Galaxy S10.Previous rumours suggest the three iterations will be called the Galaxy S10 Lite, the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspand the Galaxy S10+.The three versions are expected to vary in size and price, ranging from £699 for the cheapest and smallest 128GB S10\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspversion, to £1,399 for the biggest and most expensive 1TB S10+ version.S10 (Creative Commons, mobil-helden)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspsuggest it may feature a self-healing screen, which makes use of a protective material to help prevent scratches.A Samsung patent for the screen describes an anti-fingerprinting composition having a self-healing property, and a film, a laminate, and a device including the anti-fingerprinting composition, for use in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwill be unveiled at a Samsung event ahead of the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, according to sources at a major tech retailer cited by the Gizmodo\u0026nbspwebsite.\u0026nbspSamsung has not revealed the exact date of the release, but the smartphone is expected to be released on 8 March 2019.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/17/rts1a6jk.jpg","title":"slack ban accounts us sanctions cuba iran","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We have gone to significant efforts to make sure it doesn’t fly off.”Six previous efforts have been held back by a string of problems – including windy weather and a broken-down car.Gormley’s sculpture was installed in 1998, marking its 20th birthday this year (PA)One member of the group said he spent £90 on fabric to create the hat, sewing it all together with the help of his girlfriend and his grandmother’s sewing machine.“Someone on Twitter said it’s just a couple of drunk kids,” he said. “Drunk folk don’t usually carry around 25ft hats in their pocket.”Gateshead Council has yet to speak out on the stunt, while Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and Northumbria Police have declined to comment.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury.

I\u0027d like to think so, she said.Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognise some of life\u0027s baffling paradoxes, such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil.Even the power of faith, which frequently inspires great generosity and self-sacrifice, can fall victim to tribalism.As she does every year the Queen thanked members of the armed forces, many of whom will be deployed overseas at Christmas, for their efforts.She also remembered her father, George VI, reflecting on his service with the Royal Navy during the First World War and the role he played in the early years of the Commonwealth.The Queen also acknowledged the sacrifices of the thousands of seamen who died fighting in the First World War Battle of Jutland in 1916 during which her father served as a midshipman.She said: The British fleet lost 14 ships and 6,000 men in that engagement. My father wrote in a letter: \u0027How and why we were not hit beats me\u0027. Like others, he lost friends in the war.In the lighter aspects of the speech, the Queen highlighted that she had a memorable 2018, with two of her grandchildren - the Duke of Cambridge and Zara\u0026nbspTindall\u0026nbsp- welcoming new additions to their families.Another grandson, Prince Harry, married\u0026nbspMeghan\u0026nbspMarkle\u0026nbspand they became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announcing soon afterwards that were expecting their first child, due in the spring.Bringing a touch of humour to her televised address, the Queen said: Closer to home, it\u0027s been a busy year for my family, with two weddings and two babies and another child expected soon.It helps to keep a grandmother well occupied.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury.

The next generation are not coming into this business, so if we do not get skilled workers from abroad you will not see Indian restaurants on the UK streets.”Mr Junue said a 2013 scheme to train homegrown chefs barely had any applicants, forcing the plans to be halted.“We can’t get staff from the UK because people just don’t want to do it.”He added that in the run up to the Brexit referendum the BCA met with senior politicians who they claim gave assurances that the immigration rules would be changed if they supported Brexit. \u0026nbsp“We supported Brexit because we were promised we would be allowed to bring our skilled workers subcontinent,” Mr Junue said. \u0026nbsp“Prior to the referendum we were promised by Boris Johnson, Priti Patel and Michael Gove that if we came out of Europe that it is likely they will be open for people from the sub-continent to come.”Redoan Pasha, who owns Taste of India in Euston, London, said not only were staffing issues a concern but Brexit had resulted in less customers and higher prices for ingredients.He noted that certain imports had to be made from the EU and they had vastly increased in price since the referendum.“Brexit is a disaster for the curry industry. Two years ago we thought it would be good but it certainly has not been,” Mr Pasha told The Independent.“We have already lost 75 per cent of our business in total.”The concerns about Brexit have led to many in the industry to say they feel “cheated” by Brexit.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, getting into the Irish Sea at Bangor beach in Northern IrelandMembers of the Shakti Sings choir sing as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise, as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument near Amesbury.

SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsThere are genuine problems with all the possible questionsClick to followIndy PoliticsThe idea of giving the public a Final Say on Brexit is gaining popular currency, with reports that allies of the prime minister are belatedly coming around to the idea of a second referendum.But there is one problem: if a second vote is to be\u0026nbspheld, what would the question be?This is more complicated than it sounds. There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Looks shocking on the film, unacceptable in any environment.”However, shortly after prime minister’s questions, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman denied the allegation, insisting: “He did not call her a ‘stupid woman’. So I don’t think there is a basis for an apology. As I understand it he said ‘stupid people’.”The spokesman told reporters: “Lip reading in such circumstances is always open to doubt.”As tempers flared, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said he did not see or hear the alleged remark, but made clear: “Is that language unacceptable? Yes.”He also urged Mr Corbyn “to return to the chamber” to hear his verdict on what happened later this afternoon, after watching the TV footage.Corbyn\u0027s barely there leadership could lead to mutiny – againLabour \u0027would fall behind Lib Dems\u0027 if Corbyn backs May\u0027s Brexit dealJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027In a BBC TV studio, Barry Gardiner, a Labour frontbencher and Corbyn ally, said he was “not a lipreader” but agreed it appeared that Mr Corbyn had said “stupid woman”.The row blew up after Ms May likened Mr Corbyn’s attempt to force a confidence vote in her earlier this week to a Christmas pantomime – accusing him of dithering.First he said he would call a no confidence vote, Then he said he wouldn’t. Then he did, but it was not effective. “Oh yes he will, oh no he won’t,” she taunted – saying the Labour leader should “look behind him” at his own despairing MPs.But Mr Corbyn hit back, saying it was the prime minister’s job to deliver the negotiation and, if she was incapable of doing so, she should step aside for someone who can.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereVote of no confidenceOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It spells out what will happen if the UK and EU cannot agree a trade deal which maintains an open border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland.The EU insisted on the fall-back, in part at the request of the Irish government, because\u0026nbspan open border is a key part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspThe UK and the EU both say they do not want the backstop to be implemented but it is the default option until a deal on the future relationship is agreed.The backstop would see\u0026nbspthe whole of the UK enter\u0026nbspinto a\u0026nbspcustoms union with the EU, while Northern Ireland would also have to abide by\u0026nbspEU single market rules on goods.Leo Varadkar warns Theresa May not to renege on backstop vowThis would remove the need for checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Ireland, because the two territories would fall under the same tariffs and the same regulations.However,\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland would remain in part of the EU single market, while the rest of the UK would not.That would mean there would have to be new regulatory checks\u0026nbspon goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, because they would fall under different regulatory regimes. The EU would need to be sure that goods from Great Britain entering the EU via the Northern Irish border met European standards.The need for these new checks is a major problem\u0026nbspfor the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up Ms May\u0027s government but is staunchly opposed to the backstop and, as a result, the proposed Brexit deal as a whole.Unionists fear that a policy which would see Northern Ireland and Great Britain fall under different regulations, but Northern Ireland and Ireland come under the same regime, could be the first step towards the break-up of the United Kingdom and the unification\u0026nbspof Ireland.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.While many Tory MPs also strongly oppose the backstop, they mostly do so for different reasons\u0026nbspto the DUP.Brexiteers fear that the\u0026nbspUK would not be able to exit the backstop without the EU’s approval, because the draft withdrawal agreement says the EU and the UK must “decide jointly” if and when the mechanism is no longer necessary.\u0026nbspWhat is the Brexit orce bill?What Britain\u0027s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitMinister warns no-deal Brexit \u0027simply not an option\u0027 May shelves flagship \u0027ghost policies\u0027 because of Brexit \u0027paralysis\u0027Eurosceptics are also concerned\u0026nbspthat the backstop is “indefinite”, because the withdrawal agreement includes no time limit. They fear it could see the UK trapped in a customs union with the EU permanently - restricting,\u0026nbspthey say,\u0026nbspthe UK\u0027s ability to\u0026nbspnegotiate trade deals with other countries.Delaying the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbsppromised to secure fresh assurances from the EU on the temporary nature of the backstop and the UK\u0027s ability to exit it. But with Brussels insisting that the withdrawal agreement cannot be re-negotiated, the row over the policy looks set to rumble on.The backstop could well\u0026nbspscupper Ms May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit plan and, some pro-Europeans hope, make a second referendum all but inevitable.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway – doppelgängers of themselves.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCreated with Sketch.Films to watch before you die Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

He knows the vote will have a direct impact on his life.The father of four always joins the crowds from across the world who converge each year for Christmas Mass in Manger Square, the alleged birthplace of Jesus Christ.But this year the famed gathering is only half full and there is a muted despair edging the celebrations. It has been a particularly hard year for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the spectre of new elections in Israel have only added anxiety about everyone’s futures.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThere have already been fears of a fourth war between Israel and Gaza in less than a decade after intense cross-border exchanges of fire this year.In the last month many have speculated there may even be a third Intifada after Palestinian shooters in the occupied West Bank killed at least five Israelis, sparking mass raids by security forces.The stories behind a painful year in the Israel-Palestine conflict“Peace is far from being achieved, I really feel that the void between the Palestinians and Israelis has never been so wide, it’s the worst year yet,” Sami told The Independent, close by a towering Christmas tree in holy city.“And now we have to hold our breath for the Israeli elections. I hope the left win as that is our last chance of there being some form of peace. If the right win we will never see a Palestinian state ever,” he added.Embattled rightwing Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to rule Israel with a knife edge one-seat parliamentary majority since November, when defence minister Avigdor Lieberman quit – taking his political party and seats from the ruling coalition with him.Mr Lieberman left his job over Mr Netanyahu’s decision to accept a tentative ceasefire with militants in Gaza to stop another war.Trew  The Independent)But on Monday, Christmas Eve, heads of parties in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition agreed to hold early polls in April “in the name of budgetary and national responsibility”.Mr Netanyahu, eager to portray the move as positive, said he hoped Israel would be led by a similar coalition to the current one, seen as the most rightwing in Israel’s history.“The current coalition is, in my eyes, the core of the next coalition,” Mr Netanyahu said.“We ask for a clear mandate from the voter to continue to lead the state of Israel in our own way.”At the Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem they fear the next administration will only be more right-leaning and more hawkish, leading to a more aggressive policy of settlement building in the West Bank, and a less peaceful stance towards Gaza.Trew  The Independent)This year was marred by president Donald Trump’s May decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, thereby recognising the contested city as the Israeli capital.It sparked 10 months of protests in Gaza along the Israel Gaza border during which over 200 Palestinians were killed.Israeli soldiers defended their use of force saying that the Palestinians were launching incendiary kites and balloons laced with explosives at Israeli land.At the end of the year violence also exploded in the West Bank eroding hopes of a peace deal.

Every year gets worse and that is the way it is,” he added.Across the square Ahmed, 25 who works with the Palestinian Red Crescent agreed. “I feel like we have got to the point where we are so far apart, we are speaking in entirely different languages,” he said. “I just can’t see how we can move on from here,” he adds.Mohamed, 24, a Muslim who joined the Bethlehem celebrations to show solidarity for his Christian friends, says he cannot see a solution to the crisis. “You can’t make two states out of one, and the Israelis won’t give us any space,” he concluded.“I’m against the shootings in the West Bank, I’m against violence. I’m for peace, but how we can build this.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I know I’m going to get some comment.“It’s quite embarrassing, especially going to the doctors when my name comes up on the screen and there’s a few people who laugh at me. It’s not very nice to be honest.“I got married in  so that’s when my name changed, before that I was Billstein but that wasn’t much better because no one could ever spell it.“It’s not my husband’s fault.“I’ve even got the Prime Minister’s middle name which doesn’t help either.“It’s since she became PM. Before I don’t think anyone really took much notice. I havent noticed any great change since Brexit.“I get people coming up to me and saying ‘can you give us more money ’“When I came back from France and through Border Control they said ‘ha, ha, you’re our boss and stuff like that.“You just get stupid comments all the time. I’ve heard it so many times now. It’s very tiring, to be honest.I dont know too much about Theresa May the Prime Minister, I find the whole politics thing quite confusing.Emma Watson, , a freelance publicist from Newcastle “It’s usuallyI’m getting on a flight or I’m checking into a hotel that it gets mentioned.“I was flying into LA once and I remember walking through the cabin and the cabin crew behind me went ‘oh no it’s not her, it’s just that girl over there’.“I also remember I checked into a hotel in Dallas once and handed my stuff over and he said ‘oh you’re not her!’ I said ‘no, but I’m me!’“The plus side is when going through passport control they always mention the name and I get through really easily.“I haven’t had any freebies but it’s good particularly in the States when I’m making a reservation over the phone for a restaurant or something because they hear the English accent and I give them the name and it makes it easier.“It only became a thing when the Harry Potter films began.“Whenever I show my credit card or driving licence, there’s always a comment, every time. I half expect it now because I’m used to it.“I’ve never seen a Harry Potter film, I’ve never read a Harry Potter book and I find her a bit hard work as well.“She’s the polar opposite of me – I used to work with rock and metal bands, she would hate all of that.”WINSTON CHURCHILL, , from SwindonThe dad-of-three said: I appreciate the name.“Nobody ever believes me when I say it.“They say ‘oh you must be joking’. I’m not actually using Winston at the moment, I’m using Mick. My we doesn’t really like the Winston bit.“But my real name is Winston Michael Churchill and that’s what I have to put downI ever sign anything.“I used to hate it when my name was called out when I went to the doctors because everyone glares at you but I’m happy to have the name I’ve got.“I think Churchill was a great minister in his day, there’s a lot on the TV about him and I say ‘well that never happened to me!’“I still work part-time at the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon as a cleaner.“They get a lot of new youngsters come in and some of the top people say to them ‘he’s called Winston Churchill’ and they say ‘no way’. And so they come up and ask ‘are you really called Winston Churchill, is that right ’ And I say ‘yeah’ and they walk away shaking their heads in disbelief.“You get the mickey taken out of you over the years, so I’m so used to it.”SIMON COWELL, , a construction manager from Leeds“I go to Southampton airport every weekend and I get people smiling and there was one day when there was an announcement saying ‘can the last remaining passenger Simon Cowell make his way to Gate  or whatever’ which was a bit embarrassing because everyone was stood there looking for him and there were really disappointed when it wasn’t him.“I went to Barbados earlier this year and the cabin crew were expecting actual Simon Cowell to get on.“It’s the little things you get, like people will laugh at you in the chemists, or when they look at your credit card.“It’s not benefited me in any great way.“When I was younger, before Simon Cowell was famous, I had a quiet le.It’s been the last  years it’s been a thing. I wouldn’t say I’m a fan of Simon, but I don’t mind the guy.NAOMI CAMPBELL, , an officer manager from Stockport“Sharing the same name as the world’s most ­famous supermodel comes with its challenges.“People judge me on my looks when they hear my name and I feel like saying: I’m not a supermodel.“She’s this powerful, fiery female and I’m a shy ft in girl from a council estate.“When I call up the local Pizza Express I always get: Are you the real Naomi Campbell “I stop myself from saying: I’m pretty sure the real Naomi Campbell wouldn’t eat in Pizza Express.“When I meet new people they have a joke, saying things such as: You’re a lot smaller than I expected.“After the news that Naomi was arrested for assault, I was buying a new mobile and the sales-person said: Please don’t throw your phone at me.“But I’ve got free entry to nightclubs before, so there are worse people to share a name with.”JAYME OLIVER, , a support worker from Oxford“My name was nothing special as a kid but when Jamie Oliver’s Naked Chef came on TV, suddenly I was the butt of jokes at school.“I’ve grown from hating the affiliation to loving it.“Once, my mum Gill made a reservation at Jamie’s Italian in Oxford for my birthday meal.“When we arrived, she sent me in first and the waitress said they were expecting me.“At the table there was a signed cookbook, we got a discounted bill and a free bottle of wine.“If I book us in at a restaurant, we get the best seats and amazing service.“I think they’re expecting the chef to turn up! When Colin and I married last year, he took my name.“I wasn’t going to stop being Jayme Oliver.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457655679.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may christmas dup brexit deal","story":"For what May needs above all  is a sign that the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party are prepared to back her Brexit deal.“Without the DUP, they haven’t got a chance of passing it,” warns one Cabinet minister.What, then, do the DUP need to come on board One Secretary of State who has kept open lines of communication with them, tells me that “by grim necessity, they will need something more than cosmetic concessions to vote for the deal”.This minister explains that “the DUP want a bankable reassurance that the backstop won’t be permanent and that there won’t be progressive ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”.The good news for Theresa May is that, according to one of those intimately involved in the negotiations, “the DUP want to sort things out”.“Relations between the leadership and the DUP had been in the deep freeze, they are somewhat better,” one Cabinet minister tells me.Adding that “the carelessness with which some of the principals have been treated has been repaired”.But the bad news for Theresa May is that the changes they want are signicant — and the EU aren’t going to offer them up straight away.The only way to get these changes might be to have Parliament vote for them and tell the EU that this is how the deal can get through and seethey are prepared to cooperate, or whether they’ll crash the entire Brexit negotiation over these additions.But one senior Cabinet minister laments that “Number  is miles away from being in that position”.This Secretary of State is adamant that they are “going to have to move”.Intriguingly, I am told the Irish have, via diplomatic back channels, communicated that one of the reasons they wouldn’t give May what she wanted at last week’s European Council was that they weren’t certain that what she was asking for would satisfy the DUP.I understand that privately senior Irish figures have been making clear thatthey knew precisely what the DUP wanted, they could then engage with that.I am told the Government will devote the dog days between Christmas and New Year to exploring what the DUP will accept, and what the EU can give.Getting the DUP back on board is vital for May because without that there is no chance of reducing the Tory rebellion down to a manageable size.The Tory machine is having a bit of success in whittling down the numbers against May’s deal.One hardcore Brexiteer admits that some backbench rebels “will go a bit soft”.But this sht is not yet anywhere near big enough to save May’s deal.Some in Cabinet are pinning their hopes on “people coming back after Christmas more pragmatic and less militant”.But one of those who has been trying to reduce the rebellion wearily remarks, “I don’t see much evidence of that.”The person who in Parliament, perhaps, knows the Tory Party best tells me that the equation is this: “If they get a legally binding codicil on the backstop, they’ll get it through.If they don’t, they won’t.”Over to you, Mrs May.A TORY MP is already telling colleagues that he has submitted his letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Theresa May next December.It is another reminder that the leadership issue isn’t going to go away.One loyalist Cabinet minister argues thatMay makes it through Brexit, she should then announce the timetable for her departure at conference next year.Having said when she’s off would probably be enough to prevent a confidence vote next December and allow her to leave with some dignity.May, though, is unlikely to bite on this idea.She is extremely resistant to boxing herself in on a departure date.The confidence vote has won May some time.But she won’t make next Decembershe interprets the result as a licence to carry on as before.One senior party figure is already complaining that she’s “not prepared to make the personnel changes that would help her own position”.While one figure inside the Government machine fumes that “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing in Number  and that is causing havoc for the rest of us”.Meanwhile, ambitious Cabinet ministers are continuing to lay the ground for their leadership bids.But as one Secretary of State points out, “It is normally the manner and nature of the departure that determines the successor” which is one of the reasons why the coming Tory leadership race will be the most unpredictable contest in living memory.THE Tory rage at Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged “stupid woman” comment at Prime Minister’s Questions was fuelled by a sense that the Speaker John Bercow is biased against them.As Anna Soubry, who is normally infuriating her fellow Tories by calling for a second referendum, pointed out: If it had been a Tory man who had apparently said it about a Labour woman, Bercow would have been all over it.In recent months, senior Labour figures have openly admitted that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to the allegations of bullying against Bercow because they think he’ll help them on Brexit.This is an untenable position – it is like a team keeping a referee on the pitch because they think he’ll give them a penalty in injury time.As Wednesday showed, we are dangerously close to the Tory side of the chamber simply not accepting Bercow’s authority.One senior Tory backbencher, who has defended the Speaker in the past, tells me “it felt like an insurrection”.The tragedy of Bercow’s speakership is that once gone, the chair’s reputation for impartiality will be almost impossible to restore.MPs will never again trust in the neutrality of the Speaker as they once did.THERESA MAY is planning a New Year charm offensive as she tries to persuade Tory MPs to back her Brexit deal.All of them – and their spouses – have been invited to a party in Downing Street in the week of January , which is when the Commons debate on her deal resumes.The implicit message is clear: If the Government falls over Brexit and the Tories tear themselves apart over the issue, then there won’t be any more invites to Number  for you and your partner for a very long time.Whether this is enough to win round any wavering Tory MPs remains to be seen.It is going to take more than a few drinks to make the hardcore Brexiteers swallow their objections to the backstop.EvenTheresa May can win the big vote on her Brexit deal, she won’t be home and dry.Once the vote is won, the withdrawal agreement will have to be turned into law.This will provide plenty of opportunities for guerrilla warfare in Parliament.Cabinet ministers are particularly worried that rebels might put down an amendment making the payment of the £billion orce bill conditional on progress in the trade talks.If that passed, the EU would say that the UK hasn’t ratied the agreement and so there was no deal.Our journalists strive

We have minds of our own, and we need to take responsibility for our own actions.The reappearance of naked prejudice on the terraces can’t be blamed on anyone other than the racists themselves — and the other fans who stay silent instead of calling out the racists.These people should be named and shamed. Social media could be put to good use by posting a rogues’ gallery on every  and the faces of the bigots should be prominent, so that their wives, mothers and children can see what they’ve done. Roll on #stampoutracism.But the mystery is why there is an upsurge in such incidents right now.I, for one, thought that with the determined efforts of the clubs, led by the Kick It Out campaign, such scenes would cease. But I should have known better. Back in the early Seventies I lived ten minutes from Stamford Bridge — but I never went to home games.When it became fashionable to throw darts at our own fans, a black face standing in the Shed was nothing less than a walking bullseye.By the mid-Nineties I hoped it would be OK to bring my seven-year-old daughter and her pals to a game.Surely, there could be no danger in seats below the directors’ boxes, away from the common herd It took  minutes for me to learn the truth as two men in front of us leapt up to abuse the Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Carlton Palmer, screaming “You lanky-legged black ****”.I tapped one on the shoulder. He looked around, saw my face, and immediately apologised profusely. But the damage was done.Three weeks later, I attended a dinner at the City of London’s most glittering venue, the Guildhall.Suddenly, I found myself confronted by a familiar face — one of the same two men who had sat in the stand in front of us.A true racist, yet here he was, suave, suited and booted, at the heart of the British establishment. So much for the idea that all racists are ignorant, lower-class idiots.So what’s happened It seems bizarre that the Premier League, dominated by foreign players, many of them black, should still suffer from prejudice.And with top teams regularly playing in Europe, plus a successful England team nearly half of whose members are black or mixed race it’s hard to see why fans should start throwing bananas on the pitch again.But the truth is that many of the factors that drove racism on the terraces have never gone away, and have never been challenged effectively. Yes, recent political arguments about the EU and about immigration have allowed some of the scumbags who the game thought it had chased away to resurface with renewed bravado.It’s also possible that the increase in the number of fans from Eastern Europe, where attitudes to ersity are decidedly less tolerant, may have had an effect.Perhaps some of the brilliant players from Europe who now grace the English game might put themselves in the front line of their re-education.Butthe game wants to stamp out racism for good it needs to take a long, hard look at itself.In the Premier League, around one in five players are black.The number of black owners and coaches is negligible. This is sending out the worst message imaginable.I welcome the advent of great players like N’Golo Kante, Romelu Lukaku, and Dele Alli. But this is a sport owned and run almost exclusively by white men, who buy and sell black men at will.Yes, of  course, the heaviest weight that the players have to lt is their own multimillion-pound pay packets, so I don’t seek sympathy for them.But basically, football looks like the th-century plantation economy of the American South.It’s time for the game to start taking steps to make sure that its owners, their boards of directors and their executive and coaching staff look more like modern Britain.Arsenal v BurnleyAFC Bournemouth v BrightonCha v Leicester CityHuddersfield Town v SouthamptonManchester City v Crystal PalaceNewcastle United v FulhamWest Ham United v WatfordCardf City v Manchester UnitedIf the people at the top of the game seem to think that it’s OK to treat black people like field slaves, why would they expect the fans to treat the players with respect I saw my first game — Arsenal vs Leicester City — at the old Highbury ground.My dad wanted me to see his hero, the great inside-left George Eastham, in action.He realised that I was too small to see over the parapet, so we took the biggest book we had in the house for me to stand on. I watched Eastham while standing on Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the bestselling anti-slavery novel that had touched off the American Civil War.Maybe every owner needs to be sent a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book to remind our contemporary plantation bosses that it’s time for them too to confront the bigotry written into the game’s soul.Football’s racism hasn’t gone away, and it never will until we all look at its evil full in the face.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

a rare form of kidney cancer.Now aged two, the youngster has finally been given the all clear after beating the illness twice in her short le.The tots grandmother noticed her swollen tummy a few weeks after she was born in February  and when it didnt go down her mum Dominika took her to hospital.Doctors at Walsall Manor Hospital discovered the tumour, which weighed kg- almost as much as Milena who was just kg .Ms Krakowiska said: “When they did an ultrasound at hospital I knew immediately something was wrong because the staff looked at each other with shocked expressions on their faces.I was too confused and scared to ask questions about what they said.“After a lot more tests and a biopsy at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, one of the doctors sat me down and spelled it out.He said there was a huge tumour inside Milena and said it was probably cancer.I couldnt believe it - I sat and cried for hours and hours. Everything was a blur.”Milena immediately began chemotherapy to try to shrink the tumour before surgery, but the treatment was unsuccessful.Ms Krakowiska, who works as a translator, added: The chemotherapy didn’t work and the tumour kept growing – it just seemed to balloon before our eyes.“They decided to operate and try to remove it.“I will never forget the surgeon telling me afterwards that the tumour was the size of a football and weighed kg. Milena herself only weighed kg.Luckily they got all but a tiny area of it out, but it had totally destroyed one of Milena’s kidneys.”Milena was given time to recover from her operation before having more treatment, but after only a few weeks Ms Krakowiska was sure the tumour was growing again.She said: “I asked to see the consultant and he immediately sent her for an MRI scan, mainly to reassure me.We were all staggered when the scan showed the tumour was not only growing but was nearly as big as it had been in the first place.But this time it wasn’t in just one place, it had spread and was wrapped around her veins and arteries. There was no way they could operate again.”Doctors decided the only way the could save Milenas le was with a new more intensive form of chemotherapy.The treatment left her very sick and she had to be fed through a tube for months.Ms Krakowiska spent a month sleeping in the hospital at her daughters side while her three-year-old son Marcel stayed with his father, who she has separated from.In April , Milena was sent for an MRI scan to seethe chemotherapy was working and doctors discovered that only a fragment of the tumour remained and by June it had disappeared.Ms Krakowiska added: “It felt unbelievable. At last, after everything she’d been through, we could see light at the end of the tunnel.“Milena has made an amazing recovery. She has scans every three months but she’s very well.Now she talks like an adult, is full of mischief, never does what she’s told, and is always smiling.Even when she was having chemotherapy she was always smiling. She’s just one of those children whose heart is full of joy.”Now the mischievous little champion has been recognised with a special award from Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens, in partnership with TK Maxx.Cancer Research UK spokeswoman Jane Redman said: “Milena is a real star, it has been an absolute privilege to be able to recognise her courage by giving her a Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens Star Award."},{"url":null,"title":"boy santa recording ipad dog poo christmas tree","story":"But the youngster definitely wasnt expecting to capture his dog leaving a little surprise under the familys Christmas tree.Footage posted on Twitter by his sister, who goes by @Intolisa, shows the boy positioning his iPad under the Christmas tree.He can be heard excitedly telling the camera: Hey, whats up guys.

Its where we get another day off before heading back to work. Theres more to it than that though. Boxing Day is a National Bank Holiday, a chance to eat your leftovers and watch TV, the actual traditions go back much further and are steeped in history. Why is it called Boxing Day  Theres plenty of theories behind the name so weve broken them down.The earliest mention was in the s where a ‘Christmas Box’ was the name for a Christmas present. It also relates to giving to the poor. Traditionally there was a box to collect money for the poor placed in Churches on Christmas day and opened the next day - Boxing Day aka St Stephens Day. The Victorians were the ones who made Boxing Day a Bank Holiday in . Around the same time the tradition of giving servants time off to visit the family was growing.

Lydia Scott, , said she and her partner had no idea they would be living beneath a large family - but they found out the moment they moved in together in Stoke Newington in north-east London. She said they noticed the loud, constant noise on their first night and it hasnt stopped - with some of the children running around until am. Lydia told MyLondon that she has complained to the father, but its still loud and the noise has made it impossible to settle in their pound,-a-month, one-bedroom flat.   She said her dream of making a home with her boyfriend Tristan, , has been made impossible because of the children, and they are planning to move out. She claims her landlord had no idea such a large family was living upstairs. Lydia, who works part-time for a charity and part-time as a pet-sitter, said: When we first looked round I thought it seemed too good to be true. Its a pretty big space and has a balcony. We were both really excited when we got the keys, but then on the first night we moved in the noise began. We heard thumping and running about upstairs, it sounded like someone was moving furniture around too.  Lydia and Tristan, who works for a charity, went to meet the neighbours and to complain about the noise.She said they were really nice but that not much has changed since. She said: The noise starts around pm every night when I get home from work. You can hear the kids running about, sometimes it goes on until am. We asked them to try and keep the kids from running about above our bedroom. And thats got a bit better.  The dad even gave me his number so I can text him when it gets too out of hand, hes really nice about it. But theyve got  children - its going to be noisy no matter what. Lydia and Tristan pay pound, a month for their ground-floor flat with a balcony in trendy Stoke Newington and have been living there since May. Being unable to relax at home has been really hard on Lydia, whose mum died of cancer in September. She said: I was literally splitting my time between caring for my mum and being in the flat, so when I couldnt relax in the flat it was super stressful.  The noise has really affected our experience living in this flat. Were going to move out when the lease runs out in May. But finding somewhere in London takes so much time and energy, and with everything thats happened in the last six months we cant face it right now. Despite everything, Lydia is stoic about their situation.

Roxy, a Staffordshire bull terrier, is described as highly intelligent but despite her smarts the poor pooch has spent almost a decade in an animal shelter. Staff at Teckels in Whitminster, Gloucestershire, would bring specialist games to keep Roxy entertained and were amazed at how quickly she could figure them out. And now Roxy has finally found a home and has spent her first Christmas there after being adopted by dog groomer Leanne Wenban, Gloucestershire Live reports.  Leanne said: We saw her on the Teckels website and we saw that she had been at the kennels for a long time. We thought that we would see how it goes and it took around six months to get to where we are now. At first she ignored us but we went up to see her every Thursday and Sunday. At first we would sit in the cage with her and then eventually we were able to walk and cuddle her.  It does not usually take a dog that long to get used to someone but she needed extra time. Roxy now has her own bedroom complete with toys and treats, but she is still settling into the new home. After spending so long in the animal sanctuary, Roxy is still anxious and is not used to the peace and quiet. Leanne said: At first Roxy came to our house on visits. She is so good and she sleeps a lot. She loves to be tucked up into her blanket.  She also has her own bedroom which is like a small childs bed. Before she was so used to all the noise from the kennels which was fine and what she is or was used to but now I think that she is catching up on the peace and quiet. Leanne said that she loves all dogs and her partner Sam Green is what she describes as a bull breed fanatic. Leanne added: We have bought her lots of games. Board games for dogs, a snuffle mat, she is very clever. She works them out in minutes and we have to mix the games up each day as she remembers and figures out where the treats are. Teckels have been really good and have worked around us. They have made sure that there is always someone from there to be on hand to help Roxy visit. After a while, they did not have to supervise us being with her when we were making our visits. We were able to just sign in and go to see her. She is now starting to say hello to other dogs and is still a little nervous as it is like she sees it as her territory.

Lora Gosling, , went with  family and friends to the plush Woodbury Park Hotel for what they hoped would be a decadent festive meal. But they were left waiting for hours for their dinner and staff at the hotel near Exeter, Devon, offered no explanation, she claims. Many people took to social media to complain about the service, with some calling it a Fawlty Towers experience, Devon Live reports. The hotel says one of the ovens stopped working just as guests started to arrive.   Simon Grfin wrote on the hotels Facebook page: Our Christmas dinner  experience was at best Fawlty Towers! which is not what you expect when you pay pound. Sharon Simpson added: Shambolic Christmas dinner, what a disappointment. In the end, Lora and her family left without eating their pre-paid dessert and said the terrible experience ruined their Christmas. She said: We arrived at ten past  for a .pm lunch. We were the first ones there. At least we got our main course in the end but we waited an hour for our starter and another three hours for our main course and by then we had to leave at pm without our dessert.  Other people were just getting their mains when we left. I felt for the waiting staff who were copping it. They just kept telling people it would be another  minutes. People were not angry - just deflated. It was Christmas Day and they were hungry. There were about  people with young children who all left at about four without getting their main course. They need to offer a refund to everyone who was there. We were told we had to send an email to ask for a refund. They just said not to pay our bar bill. Related video: Shopper left fuming by smelly and revolting supermarket turkey  We asked to see the manager and he was as good as gold and held his hands up and admitted they had done really badly and it wasnt good enough. There were more than  people and everybody was just totally deflated. Her partner Darrell Willis said: It was awful. There were so many upset people. It was a shambles. Christmas dinner at the -bedroom hotel were sold at pound per person, and in some cases were paid for in advance. John Bishop, from Pinhoe, Devon, said he went with three others and paid full price as a gt to his mother in law, but they all left after the first course. He said: She was really looking forward to it and it was awful. There were a few tears on the way home.  We spent pound each and walked out after two and a half hours with only having our first course. Loads of unhappy customers waited longer than us. It was disgusting - mind you the soup was nice! But a bit pricey. My wes salmon starter was lovely - but by then she would have ate the plate as well. What a waste of a day. We are having a second Christmas day on Boxing Day to make up for it and trying to see the funny side of it. But for a professional organisation like that who cater for all the rugby teams, it was a shambles. The restaurant manager who was there was new and he was so polite but the lack of information was part of the problem. People were offering to put on a pinny and go and help.  Calum Colquhoun, general manager at the hotel, said he would be speaking to inidual diners personally to apologise. He explained that one of the main ovens had stopped working just as people began to arrive for lunch and said it was incredibly disappointing. He said: I have been doing this job for a long time and I have to say in terms of things going wrong it could not have been worse timing. I am incredibly disappointed that we have gone through the whole festive season serving literally thousands of covers and we got to the most important service of the whole month and this happened. Some people began to arrive early and there was no going back. The oven was out of action for an hour but it was in that critical time when it was incredibly bad timing for the kitchen and everything began to snowball. There was nothing  we could have done. A few people I have spoken to had a great meal but for many we simply did not get their food out quickly enough. It was dficult for the front of house staff. We have asked those people who were affected to contact us.

But as soon as the little prince, who was at the time fourth in line to the throne, arrived things changed dramatically. Speaking before her tragic death, Diana revealed the first comment Charles made about his second son made her close off. During an interview in , published in a book by Andrew Morton years later, she said: Then suddenly as Harry was born it just went bang, our marriage, the whole thing went down the drain.  Diana claims to reveal the first words out of her husbands mouth were oh God, its a boy, followed by: and hes even got red hair. She said: Something inside me closed off. Harry would have been around the age of seven at the time of Diana interviews. She said of the young prince: Harry was a complete joy and is actually closer to his father than perhaps William at the moment. She also admitted that she hid Harrys gender from Charles because she knew how much he wanted a little girl.  She said: I knew Harry was going to be a boy because I saw on the scan. Charles always wanted a girl. He wanted two children and he wanted a girl. I knew Harry was a boy and I didnt tell him. Harry arrived, Harry had red hair, Harry was a boy. Diana didnt stop there. She claimed that Charles took his discontent over not having a boy to her own mother at Harrys christening. She said: [Prince] Charles went to talk to my mother at Harrys christening and said: We were so disappointed - we thought it would be a girl.  Frances Kydd, who orced from Dianas father Viscount John Spencer in , reportedly wasnt best pleased with his comment. Mummy snapped his head off, saying: You should realise how lucky you are to have a child thats normal. Ever since that day the shutters have come down and thats what he does when he gets somebody answering back at him. Andrew Morton, unable to go to the palace to interview Diana in person, conducted by proxy interviews instead.  He enlisted the help of mutual friend James Colthurst to present questions to the princess and recorded her answers on secret tapes. It is widely thought Diana wanted to get her own story out before she was solely blamed for the orce. According to the book, Charles and his we had been in total darkness between the births of William and Harry and she had blotted it out as it was such pain. Diana said: However, Harry appeared by a miracle.

The Royals however have their own traditions - which they usually rigidly adhere to. Its well known that the entire royal family traditionally spends Christmas and New Year at Sandringham, the Queens country estate in Norfolk. However, whats less well known is that the royal family normally open their presents on Christmas Eve, a legacy of the Queens German heritage. Former royal chef Darren McGrady said: The royals are of German descent so they weave in German traditions to their celebrations. After afternoon tea, they open gts on Christmas Eve, as is the German tradition.

Hundreds of well-wishers had braved the cold conditions to see the fab four as Harry, Meghan, William and Kate have been dubbed by the media.  Missing was the Duke of Edinburgh, understood to be in good health and spending the day relaxing with his family, and the Duchess of Cornwall, who is still suffering from a heavy cold.

One year on from when the Duchess of Sussex debuted a less-than-perfect curtsy to the Queen, the pregnant royal seemed far more impressive and adhered to royal protocol. Last Christmas royal experts criticised Meghan for her poor attempt compared to Kates more polished effort - although the Duchess of Cambridge had had more practice. This year, the pregnant Duchess pulled off a much deeper curtsy, with her hands clasped together and head bowed as a sign of respect outside the St. Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham. In her effort last year Meghan, a relative royal novice, did not plant her right properly which meant she could not get a deep curtsy without losing her balance. This year her  was a lot more solid.  Royal butler Grant Harrold told the Daily Mail: What you should be doing, for a lady, is the right foot behind the left, and then it is a gentle bob. You keep the hands in because youre not a penguin. Mr Harrold said the well-practised Duchess of Cambridge pulled off the dficult manoeuvre with aplomb.

All eyes were on the duchesses as they walked into the Sandringham church with their husbands after rumours of a rt between the two women. While they appeared to be laughing and joking, and Meghan even placed her hand on Kates back at one point, an insider claims things werent quite as smooth as they seemed. An insider told the Sun: The Queen and Charles have allowed the situation to play out without overtly interfering — but they both made it clear that Christmas was for the whole family to really come together.   That meant the two couples walking into church together as the Fab Four just like they had last year. Yes, it was awkward and uncomfortable given whats gone on over the past  months. But the alternative of even more negativity on Christmas Day wasnt worth thinking about. The Christmas outing follows months of rumours that Kate and Meghan dont get on, with the people around them claiming they are very dferent. But it is thought the pair called a truce after the Queen and Prince Charles intervened.   A Palace source said: As Her Majesty the Queen has often said in her Christmas \u2028Day messages, the festive season \u2028is a time of shytogethershyshyshyness and the Royal Family hold that shyparticular notion very dear. The lead-up to Christmas is often a stressful time for many people and it is at times such as these that it is important to bring one’s family together and enjoy much of what there is to be thankful for.   Rumours started after Meghan and Harry revealed they would not be moving into an apartment next door to Kate and William in Kensington Palace. Theyve decided to start their family in Frogmore Cottage in Windsor instead, near where they married earlier this year. It has been further fuelled by rumours Kate was left in tears at Princess Charlottes bridesmaid dress fitting. After the church service the royals headed back to their Norfolk estate for a day of celebrations and food.

The Duchess of Sussex is expecting her first child with Prince Harry in the spring, and shes been proudly showing off her growing bump for the last month. But some of her staff are a bit worried about her as it seems she has no plans to slow down in the lead up to her due date. The Mirrors royal correspondent Russell Myers says the Duchess is a workaholic and claims she got where she got by being a certain way.  Speaking on Lorraine, Russell said: Certain members of staff and the aides are encouraging her to slow down a little bit, perhaps she is taking on too much. Meghan took on her first solo project, a charity cookbook for people affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy, earlier this year and it was a huge success. Shes expected to announce her royal patronages in the new year after in-depth conversations with the Queen. The women met for tea at Buckingham Palace earlier this month to discuss Meghans potential new roles. Its likely that Meghan will take on causes which are in line with her interests, including female empowerment, education and the arts.  She is said to have secretly already met a rang of organisations and charities. They include the Campaign for Female Education, which supports marginalised girls in Africa, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The Queen is patron of more than  organisations and charities. Two years ago, she handed  patronages to younger members of the royal family. She gave the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club — host of the Wimbledon tournament - to the Duchess of Cambridge while Prince Harry received the Rugby Football Union.

One posted on Twitter: Always warms an old republican’s heart to see the billionaire head of an antiquated institution, surrounding themselves with gold in their modest -roomed detached home, while others are f***ing struggling to make ends meet.

The gilded case is decorated in the French early eighteenth-century style with cherubs and singeries – comical scenes involving monkeys playing musical instruments and making mischief. Queen Victoria had owned a piano decorated in a similar manner almost twenty years earlier.

The restoration was mainly to remove substantial dirt from the two main lids and the upper surfaces, and to restore nish. According to the Royal Collection trust, it measures .cm x . x .. Erard was founded by Seacutebastien Erardwho started out making pianos for the French nobility The firm passed through the generations of the Erard family, which opened a London premises in . When Pierre Erardran the London business the firm won a gold medal at the  Paris Exposition and became piano maker to Albert, Prince Consort - husband of Queen Victoria.

Temperatures are expected to hit C in some places on Wednesday - twice as warm as usual for December  - as shoppers spend billions on post-Christmas sales. It follows one of the mildest Christmas Days ever in Britain, where the warmest spot was Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands with a temperature of almost C. But Britons should enjoy the unusually warm weather while it lasts - the Met Office is predicting a spell of bitter wind chills and snow that will go on for weeks.  Until then, Boxing Day will be mild and mainly dry but cloudy for many with some drizzly rain, mainly over higher ground, the Met Office said. It will be bright across southern England and later in parts of Wales and the Midlands. In many places, the conditions will be pleasant for shoppers on the hunt for Boxing Day bargains.  Further north, rain is likely in parts of north and west Scotland. Overnight, there will be frost and patchy fog under clear spells in southern England, while rain will move east across Scotland. Elsewhere, it will be cloudy and damp with some fog over hills.  Thursday - as some Britons head back to work after the Christmas break - it will be generally dry and rather cloudy. There could be some light and patchy drizzly rain in the west. It will be brighter in the south after a chilly start. Temperatures will stay relatively mild.  Heading into the weekend, the weather will stay generally mild with dry and cloudy conditions in most places. Mist and fog is likely in the south, with more unsettled conditions in the north and north-west, where the Met Office is predicting rain and strong winds at times. Met Office five-day forecast WednesdayMild and mainly dry but cloudy for many with a little drizzly rain, mainly over higher ground. Brighter skies developing across southern England and edging into parts of Wales and the Midlands. Rain for parts of north and west Scotland. Wednesday night Frost and patchy fog under clear spells in southern England. Rain moving east across Scotland, with showers and clear spells following. Elsewhere often cloudy and damp with some hill fog.  Thursday Generally dry and rather cloudy, though some light and patchy drizzly rain in the west. Brighter in the south, where it will start off chilly, otherwise relatively mild. Friday to Sunday Often dry but rather cloudy with mist and fog in the south. More unsettled in the north and northwest with rain and strong winds at times. Generally mild for most. What is the forecast for New Years Eve   The Met Office said there is a chance of rain across parts of the north and north-west, but there will also be a good deal of dry weather, especially in the south although here some fog may linger through the day. Similar conditions are expected on New Years Day and the same pattern is likely to carry on through the first week of January. Through the first week of the new year, any wet and windy weather is most likely to be confined to the north, where snow could fall over hills and potentially spread south at times. Temperatures will stay mild in many places before the weather takes a turn for the worse around the middle of the month. The Met Office warned: By mid-month there is a greater chance of colder weather, with an increasing likelihood of frost, fog and snow, with these conditions probably continuing for the rest of the period. Despite the potential change to much colder weather during mid-January, some milder, wet and windy interludes remain possible throughout the period.

But one mum decided to work out exactly how much she spend on her family this Christmas, and shes absolutely horried. She claims the total figure left her feeling sick and she admits shes been stupid. Explaining her situation, she says she was in hospital so ended up rushing a lot of the present buying. Speaking very honestly on parenting website Mumsnet she reveals she spend more than pound,, saying: This isnt a boast. I actually feel quite sick.   Ive been in hospital and was in a rush to get things done. I have six children and a big family. I just kept spending without budgeting.Ive spent about pound each on the kids - lots of clothes and things they need - hot water bottle, duvet cover, water bottle, school pencils, pjs etc plus lots of toys. We buy hardly any clothes during the year and no toys whatsoever.We cant really afford it - although its manageable. I just feel a bit sick really. Please tell me youve spent more and let me know there are others out there who have spent similar. Think Christmas is a little ruined. Learn from me people. Ive been stupid. Other parents were sympathetic to the mums stress, and many came up with ideas of how to improve the sitaution. Some suggested she holds some of the things back for birthdays later in the year, and others said she could justthem. One mum wrote: Well, look on it as spending money that needs to be spent,a chunk of it is on clothes and essentials. Its just youre spending it all in one v buying a little every month. Try breaking it down monthly for the essential stuff and it probably looks a lot more reasonable.   Another wrote: If its manageable dont feel bad. Ive spent pound on DD and honestly have very little to show for it. Trainers cost pound, branded stuff costs are high and thats the norm with her friends. You really cant compare with others. Not one of DD gts were less than pound so pound  budget would go nowhere with a teen imo. My budget has had to double in the past two years. Others shared their budgeting tactics. One wrote: pound per person unless its children, in which case they get a big presentand a little present. Adults get a token present up to pound. Dp [darling partner] gets a special presenthe needs it. Last year it was a leather jacket at pound because his old one had just fallen apart. Another added: pound on each child that’s crazy!

Italian photographer Stefano Tiozzo was on a tourist boat filming the stunning view of Los Glaciares National Park, in Argentina, when the floating body of ice suddenly turned on itself with a massive roar. As the other passengers were shouting with excitement, Stefano captured some shots of the icebergs previously hidden base as it rolls above the surface. Finally settling, the freshly revealed glacier appears to glow bright blue under the midday sun. Stefano who recorded the clip on Monday, November  said: I was lucky to have my camera switched on before the iceberg started spinning. That way I was able to film the whole transition of colours and shapes which was exceptional to see.” The boat from which Stefano filmed was cruising on Lago Argentino, the biggest lake in the country, which gets its waters from the melting glaciers close-by. He said: Most likely, the iceberg had detached from the Spegazzini glacier a few weeks before. Icebergs flip over a number of times during their lespan, because their underwater surface melts faster and becomes lighter than the one above, causing their centre of gravity to switch. However, it happens once every few months, and its a very rare thing to be able to see. Even the guide on the boat said it was the first time he had seen something of this kind."},{"url":null,"title":"japan restart commercial whaling after","story":"NewsJapan to restart commercial whaling after pulling out of decades-old agreementJapan, which has long carried out scientic hunts, has announced it will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission agreement in JulyShareCommentsByLinda SiegKaori Kaneko:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsJapans whaling programme will restart in July \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJapan will begin commercial whaling again after pulling out of a decades-old international agreement. The country will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission in July. Commercial whale hunting ended in  after some species were driven to the brink of extinction.Greenpeace slammed Japans decision: The declaration is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures.The country says whale hunting is part of its culture and there has been heavy campaigning in whaling communities to restart commercial slaughtering.The decision sparked international outrage with Australia saying it was extremely disappointed and New Zealand slamming the outdated and unnecessary commercial killing.  Japans commercial whaling will be limited to its own territorial waters, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who made the announcement at a news conference on Christmas Day. Japan has long maintained that most whale species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its culture. It began scientic whaling in , a year after an international whaling moratorium began. Much of the meat ends up on store shelves, even though most Japanese no longer eat it. From July , after the withdrawal comes into effect on June , Japan will conduct commercial whaling within Japans territorial sea and its exclusive economic zone, and will cease the take of whales in the Antarctic Ocean the Southern Hemisphere, the environment minister said in a statement.  The whaling will be conducted in accordance with international law and within the catch limits calculated in accordance with the method adopted by the IWC to avoid negative impact on cetacean resources. Japans decision followed the IWCs latest rejection of its bid to resume commercial whaling at a September meeting, which Suga said showed it was impossible to bridge the gap between whaling advocates and anti-whaling members. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said: Whaling is an outdated and unnecessary practice.We continue to hope Japan eventually reconsiders its position and will cease all whaling in order to advance the protection of the oceans ecosystems.Influential lawmakers in Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Liberal Democratic Party whose constituencies include whaling communities have long lobbied for a resumption of commercial whaling.Abes own electoral district includes Shimonoseki, a whaling port in western Japan.

However, the gaffer spoke about it to us during the week and the way we played compared to the week before at Morton was miles better.“That’s the way we want to play and we believe it gives us the best chance of winning every game or at least most of the games.“You are not going to walk through this league but we like to play with high tempo, pass the ball and cause problems for the opposition we can take advantage of.

We had some good results throughout the season.“There was the win at Ibrox , the one at Hibsin the cup and also Rangersin the cup.“We know what we have in the squad and it was just trying to build the  of clean sheets and being good defensively.“The strikers are now scoring goals, which is always crucial for us, and we are picking up the wins.“It was always there, it was just a case of going out there and doing it as a team.“We have done that and hopefully it will continue.”The Betfred Cup final loss was the first fixture of a congested run with nine games packed into this month.In the immediate aftermath of that final loss, Shinnie claimed Celtic lacked class for their over-celebrations.Shinnie blasted the Hoops as captain Scott Brown and Mikael Lustig appeared to goad teen Lewis Ferguson by celebrating in front of him just seconds before full-time at Hampden.It wasn’t the first time Celtic have failed to show dignity in victory against the Dons.Shinnie was furious at the time but insists their over-celebration will not provide any extra fuel to win today.The opportunity to move level on points with the league leaders is motivation enough.He said: “Celtic won the cup on the day and deserved to celebrate, albeit it was too much in my eyes.“It was frustrating at the time but in the next couple of days you get over that pretty quick.“That is what happens when you win a trophy and so be it.“Today will be a totally dferent game as it is at Pittodrie and hopefully we will have the crowd right behind us.“Then we will see how the game goes.”Should Aberdeen overcome Celtic today it will inevitably, and rightly, spark speculation of a title challenge from Pittodrie. On a potential title bid, Shinnie is remaining grounded, insisting: “It is very early days to be saying that from where we have just came from.“We are only just getting back to where we want to be and the focus is on just taking each game as it comes.“We always want to be as close to the top as we can andthat puts us in that position, good. But we never get ahead of ourselves.”Aberdeen set up the opportunity to move level with Celtic by seeing off Hearts - at Pittodrie, courtesy of a Sam Cosgrove double.Shinnie said: “It was important to try to keep the momentum going.“We knew it was going to be a tough game as Hearts were trying to bounce back after a dficult defeat .“We knew they were going to come up and fight and scrap.“However, the boys were brilliant.“It was a real professional performance as we dealt with Hearts very well and now we move on.”Shinnie’s contract expires at the end of the season and he is free to speak to any interested clubs when the transfer window opens on January .Boss Derek McInnes wants to tie Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven, who is also set to go out of contract, on new deals.McInnes ideally wants an answer on their Pittodrie futures before January but will not lay down a concrete ultimatum.Shinnie insists his concentration has been on the packed festive fixture list and not on his future.When quizzedthere had been any development with his contract situation, he said: “Not with the amount of games we have had in December. It will take its time and will develop when it does.“I am just trying to focus on recovering from these games and trying to go again.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen railway station revamp plans approved","story":"A revamp of Aberdeen Railway Station is expected to begin in the spring after plans were approved.Abellio Scotrail Limited applied to Aberdeen City Council earlier this year to add a new glazed upper floor accommodating a relocated passenger lounge.Other improvements include the creation of a new retail unit in place of the relocated ticket office, upgrading the taxi rank and expanding pedestrian space on the site.The plans also involve carrying out alterations to the buildings at  two – currently a storage area.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

When in a state of excitement and aggression, a dog may then choose to attack a human being, and we are into another ball game entirely.The solution seems simple # keep control of your dog at all times and have it on a lead around livestock.

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house. I guarantee when we leave they#ll just plaster over it and give it to someone .#When asked about the family#s situation and lack of movement on it, Alastair McGregor said: #Once the current tenancy has ended, we will be investigating further to ensure the issues are completely resolved. With respect to the boreholes, this is not work that is incomplete. We are currently carrying out investigations and that is why they are open.#ACHA was not aware of any problems with the property at the point of letting and we would never knowingly let a property which was not wind and watertight.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a christmas thought for the week","story":"Marilyn SheddenUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis Sunday will be the fourth Sunday in Advent and it is traditionally the time for nativity plays.There are many stories of children ad-libbing and parents cringing as the youngsters make up their own words when they go #off script#.One of my favourites is about the wee boy who looked into the crib and said: #Isn#t he like his dad #The congregation laughed, as they knew these were not the scripted words – but had this wee boy not just got the gospel in a nutshell He had heard his mum say this of the new baby next door, so he thought it an appropriate thing to say.How right he was.#Isn#t he like his dad # Is this not the message of Christmas Of course, we do not know what Jesus looked like physically, but that doesn#t matter. #Isn#t he like his dad #Jesus came to show us what God was like and from the very beginning God set the stage of his nativity.Jesus was born in poverty, a refugee without a place to live, so his parents borrowed the lowliest of places – so the story goes.Jesus# birth and his le emphasise that God#s message was for the ordinary folk, those who were not important to the rich or the powerful, but who were important to God.As Jesus grew he made his home and his le with those the world rejected, with those the world despised because those were the ones who found special favour with God.Jesus came to bring God#s inclusive love to everyone and to love everyone in this wonderful kingdom.#Isn#t he just like his dad#.May God bless you at this very special time."},{"url":null,"title":"sleeping oot to awaken minds","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIn a howling wind and spattering rain, a group of brave souls slept outside in a Lochgilphead alley to raise awareness of homelessness.Taking inspiration from the Edinburgh Wee Sleep Out and Glasgow Sleep in the Park, Gill Hutton of recovery cafe Grub#s Up organised her own #Big Sleep Oot#, to highlight the rise in homelessness.Armed with ious sleeping bags, burners, scarves and hats and cardboard boxes,  determined people braved Storm Deirdre to sleep on the street."},{"url":null,"title":"review of 2018 january to june","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTragedy and communityThe year began with sadness and shock at the tragic sinking of Tarbert fishing boat Nancy Glen TT on the evening of Thursday January .Skipper Duncan MacDougall and crewman Przemek Krawczyk were missing, while crewman John Miller was rescued before the Nancy Glen went down.Painstaking searches of land and sea followed, but no signs were found of the missing men.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

It also passes through one of Robert Louis Stevensonrsquos favourite spots, which provided inspiration for Ben Gunnrsquos cave in Treasure Island.Local resident Judy Murray, mother of tennis champions Andy and Jamie, loves this walk. ldquoThe three-mile pathway, which dates back to Roman times, is one of my favourite things to do in Dunblane, she told us. ldquoIf you start at Dunblane Golf Club, you come out close to Bridge of Allanrsquos famous ice cream parlour, the Allan Cafe. Perfect! And you can always get the train back.The West Sands, St AndrewsOn a crisp winterrsquos day there are few places Irsquod rather be than walking along the uninterrupted beach and dunes of the West Sands.

This is what I said:ldquoItrsquos friendship and memory, wonderful moments and the emotions that go with them ndash the perfect partner to unforgettable events in all our lives.ldquoIt is the heady night my first daughter was born, when I arrived home from hospital and poured an Old Fettercairn to make a joyful, tearful toast to my we and tiny new baby.ldquoOr the bright May evening outside the Kingrsquos House in Glen Coe after my friend and I had climbed Agagrsquos Groove on the Buachaille Etive Mor. We shared a hip flask of Springbank as we stared up at the mountain, and it was the best Irsquod ever tasted.ldquoIt is the evenings around my kitchen table with my pal from across the road, music playing a little bit too loud into the wee small hours as the whisky and stories and laughter flow.ldquoThese moments, these images of times to treasure, that ability to create wonderful memories. That is, at the absolute basic, the essence of whisky.People often say that something is greater than the sum of its parts ndash well, that phrase could have been coined especially for Scotlandrsquos national drink.Since I first fell in love with whisky in , Irsquove been lucky enough to try some unforgettable drams ... including one or two whose price tag ran into five figures.But over the years itrsquos become clear to me that you donrsquot have to pay thousands ndash or even hundreds ndash to get your hands on something really special.If you know what yoursquore looking for you can find a spectacular dram on a supermarket shelf or in your local whisky shop, and you certainly wonrsquot need to spend as much as you think.Over the following four pages, Irsquove listed a few of my favourites ndash some of the most interesting and exciting whiskies around today. And nearly all of them cost less than pound.If you like what you read, go out and buy a bottle ndash I promise you that you wonrsquot be disappointed.Good luck!Ardnamurchan  ADABV : .%Price: poundLetrsquos start at the very beginning hellip with a dram so young wersquore not even allowed to call it whisky.Itrsquos generally accepted that the older whisky is, the better it gets, but Ardnamurchan  AD is definitely the exception that proves the rule. It boasts a depth of flavour that belies its youth ndash a heady mix of sweetness and citric sharpness, but with the richness of dried fruits and a satisfying biscuity creaminess. Far off there are hints of pepper and the odd waft of smoke. Yum!The  AD continues parent company Adelphirsquos pioneering use of blockchain to give unique levels of provenance to every bottle. By scanning the unique QR code on the back label, consumers can trace every ingredient and every stage of the ldquomanufacturing process, from field to bottle.And,yoursquore still not convinced, just look at the bottle. Simple and sleek, it won  Scottish Design Awards for packaging.So with just , bottles of this beauty ever made, itrsquos definitely worth a quick dash to grab one. It will probably be a collectorrsquos itemyou donrsquot open it. But having tasted it, that will be a really big ldquo!www.adelphidistilleryGlenkinchie -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIrsquoll never forget it.It was a pub in Dundee ndash I canrsquot remember the name but I do remember the location the Queenrsquos Hotel at the bottom of the Perth Road ndash and it was , I think.And I didnrsquot like whisky, until that amazing night when I tried Glenkinchie.My friend had bet me he could find me one that would change my mind. When he handed the Glenkinchie to me he said: ldquoLook for the ice cream.And when I drank it, it was there, coating my mouth and at the back of my tongue hellip and I was hooked!Nowadays, Irsquod say therersquos far more to this dram than hints of vanilla and a lemon cheesecake creaminess. In fact, I think that for a Lowland malt ndash itrsquos distilled just outside Edinburgh ndash it has a wonderful richness and depth, and it really stands scrutiny against the biggest guns of Speyside, and some of the great Highland malts.Add to that a lovely natural, almost herbal note and you have a dram that really is one to remember.www.maltsArran The Bothy Quarter Cask Batch ABV: .%Price: pound.They say the Isle of Arran is Scotland in Miniature. But, believe me, therersquos nothing miniatureabout this fantastic dram from a lovely distillery in the north of the island.It packs as impressive a punch as any expresssion Irsquove tried over the years.As you can guess from the name, this is the fourth release of the Quarter Cask. Each one so far has been an absolute winner, and this is no dferent.The idea is simple: take the usual Arran whisky and, for the last  months of its maturation, move it into smaller casks ndash yes, you guessed it, a quarter the size of the original and made of American Oak.This allows far greater contact between whisky and wood, resulting in a faster, more intense maturation.The result is an absolutetreat ndash rich and powerful with tonsof vanilla sweetness and peppery spice. Itrsquos fruity and fresh, but at the same time really luxurious.This is a real star in a brilliant range. The distillery is well worth a visit too ndash the scones are amazing!www.arranwhiskyKilchoman SanaigABV: %Price: poundSpeed bonnie boat like a bird on the wing, over the sea to Skye. We all know the song about Bonnie Prince Charlie but, seriously,yoursquore looking for a Young Pretender, yoursquod be far better jumping on the ferry to Islay.Kilchoman is the newest of the distilleries on this little patch of land thatrsquos jam-packed with wonderful whisky, but itrsquos already giving its globally recognised neighbours a run for their money.Following on from the Machir Bay, Kilchoman ups its game a little with the Sanaig.Itrsquos described as a peaty malt, but for me itrsquos got that beautul aroma of Arbroath Smokies ndash sharp wood-ember smokiness mixed with a wonderful creaminess thatrsquos simply irresistible.Add to that light fruit, dark chocolate and raisins, along with red-berry richness, and you could be on a picnic on a beach with your pals, chatting and laughing until the last of the embers of the fire die down.A real treat ndash and brilliant value.kilchomandistilleryBenromach -year-oldABV: %Price: pound.Sometimes whisky isnrsquot about posh tasting notes and fancy descriptions of complex aromas and flavours. Sometimes itrsquos about something thatrsquos far more simple.Sometimes, when you smell it, it transports you somewhere  ndash to a memory or a favourite place.For me, this -year-old Benromach does just that. It takes me back to when I was young, six or seven, maybe, to a time when we lived in an old house, with a big open fire, and we used to sit there of an evening ndash it would have been about this time of year ndash roasting marshmallows.I can smell the fire ndash not a roaring one, but mellow embers with the odd little puff of smoke. I can taste the rich toffee-sweetness of the melting marshmallows.But, therersquos something  too ndash is that Jamaica ginger cake  Not homemade, but the sticky one out of the packet. Itrsquos luxurious, and it makes me smile.So,you have a whisky and the tasting notes donrsquot make any sense to you, donrsquot worry. More powerful forces may be at work ndash just open your mind and see what you can see.www.benromachCaol Ila -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThis is another one ndash another malt that holds a special place in my heart.When my two daughters were young, this was the one I remember sitting back with as the madness of Christmas began to subside at the end of the day. And itrsquos still the one Irsquoll go forI see it on a menu after dinner at a hotel.Caol Ilais a Muhammad Ali of a dram hellip it dances around, all lightness and fruit itrsquos fascinating and mesmerising.But at some point or other, you just know itrsquos going to knock you out with a wonderful smack of smoke.It starts off light and refined, with fresh herbal notes and hints of damp grass, but then the coastal smokiness really kicks in ndash not unlike hot-smoked salmon. Itrsquos full-bodied and has a long, warming finish.As you add water, a wonderful freshness ndash much like Ardbeg ndash takes over, making this a hugely satisfying dram.www.maltsOld Particular Cameronbridge -year-oldABV: .%Price: poundWe couldnrsquot let a list of brilliant whiskies go without including a single-grain. And what better place to find one than at legendary Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing The Cameronbridge isnrsquot exactly blessed with the beautul surroundings of Strathisla or Glengoyne, or the rugged backdrop of Dalwhinnie ndash it sits in Fersquos industrial heartland, just a stonersquos throw from Methil and Leven.It may not have had the most romantic of beginnings, but this Cameronbridge is a real ndash and rare ndash treat.In my mind, the defining characteristic of single-grain whiskies is cream, and this expression is awash with it.In fact, when you smell it, therersquos almost an aroma oftoffee sauce ndash salted caramel mixed with all that cream, but with a bit of honey thrown in for good measure.You could almost pour it on your sponge pudding.Therersquos cakiness too ndash in fact, this is more like a big, rich sharing dessert than a dram.Now, wherersquos my spoon  I want another helping .www.douglaslaingcomOld Pulteney -year-oldABV: %Price: poundIf anyone ever says that whisky isnrsquot a product of its surroundings, this is definitely a dram to make them change their mind.Itrsquos made in Wick, and its warehouses are exposed to the full force of the North Sea.This gives the whisky a wonderful coastal, salty personality ndash and once you get to know it, you can recognise it anywhere.But donrsquot think this dram is harsh in any way at all. The -year-old is aged entirely in bourbon casks, and this gives the finished product a wonderful richness and sweetness ndash and the distinctive vanilla that is always there when bourbon casks are used.Look for vanilla, tablet and almost burnt sugar on the nose, with a flavour balancing chocolate and toffee indulgence with citrusy fruit and that coastal tang.This level of quality is great value at pound, but be aware that Old Pulteneyis regularly on offer ndash I think itrsquos pound in Tesco right now, and at that price itrsquos a steal.www.oldpulteneyKilkerran -year-oldABV: %Price: poundBefore we start, letrsquos take a moment to thank Kilkerran ndash because the distillery where itrsquos made, Glengyle, effectively saved Campbeltownrsquos status as a whisky region.After many years of only having two distilleries, Springbank and Glen Scotia, it was deemed that Campbeltown could no longer be classed as a region.However, when Glengyle was resurrected ndash it was an old distillery that closed in the s but was brought back to le in  ndash the three operational distilleries could maintain their status.And just as well, as Campbeltown malts are unique ndash robust, oily and bursting with character ndash and this Kilkerran -year-old is certainly a classic of its kind.Itrsquos oaky and slightly peaty, but super-rich, sweet and velvety smooth at the same time. And, of course, therersquos the oiliness and saltiness yoursquod expect from a Campbeltown dram.This whisky was only launched in , but it surely deserves its place among the true greats of this amazing region.All hail Kilkerran ndash you are indeed a hero!kilkerran.scotMacallan -year-old Double CaskABV: %Price: poundThe Macallan has been looking a million dollars lately hellip literally. One of its bottles ndash a -year-old distilled in  ndash broke that mad, seven-figure barrier just a few weeks ago, but far more importantlythe distillery moved house hellip to possibly the most beautully perfect building I have ever seen.So, as the year draws to a close, I was pretty sure my impression of this superbrand couldnrsquot get any more positive hellip until I tasted the Double Cask.Much of my whisky journey has been a hunt for the dferent and the new, but when I come back to a dram like The Macallan and its perfect richness, I remember therersquos a reason why this is a worldwide favourite.The Double Cask uses whisky aged in barrels of both American and European ex-sherry oak to take the spirit to a whole new level.Therersquos the classic dried fruit. Itrsquos creamy and you can almost see the drops of honey. But therersquos the sweet sharpness of marmalade and almost the spiced luxury of a cinnamon pastry.A finish of vanilla and more sweet fruit and I have only one challenge on my mind as we end .Go on Macallan, I dare you ndash top that next year.www.themacallanArdbeg An OaABV: .%Price: poundTo me, Ardbeg is about only one thing ndash itrsquos what identies it the minute I stick my nose in the glass.Smoke ndash pure, perfect, wood-embers smoke.And the An Oa ndash launched last year as the first addition to Ardbegrsquos core range for more than a decade ndash doesnrsquot disappoint.Itrsquos there in spades, mixed with a wonderful cocktail of cakey sweetness and butterscotch richness. Therersquos a luxurious creaminess in the background too, just in case you didnrsquot get just how special this dram really is.Then,you add water therersquos another treat in store ndash something I donrsquot understand from such a peaty whisky, but which I always look for in an Ardbeg.The peaty oomph remains, but something  appears ndash the most wonderful freshness. Itrsquos like a summer breeze blowing through freshly washed linen just hung out to dry on a line by the sea.If you like peaty whisky, you really canrsquot go wrong with Ardbeg, but this was the first time Irsquod tried the An Oa.Time to rewrite my whisky wish-list, I think!www.ardbegGordon  MacPhail Discovery Bunnahabhain -year-oldABV: %Price: poundThere are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that take a barrowload of peat and stuff it down your throat ndash and there are Islay whiskies ndash the ones that tone things down, some a teeny bit, some a lot. For me, Bunnahabhain sits in the second camp hellip and itrsquos all the better for it.So when Gordon  MacPhail ndash one of the countryrsquos small band of legendary independent bottlers ndash gets hold of an already interesting dram, itrsquos time to take notice.This Discovery expression ndash part of a wider range from around the country ndash is rich and exciting, with dried fruit and sherry on the nose, and hints of spice, rich vanilla and orange. Itrsquos super- smooth, and as you taste it the initial spice morphs into more richness of dates and plums. At the finish, therersquos chocolate ndash maybe not milky bar, but definitely not bitter dark ndash and more fruits.The bottlerrsquos art is a critical part of the whisky firmament ndash they hunt out interesting casks and, when they find them they bottle them. Soyou see a bottlerrsquos version of one of our favourites, go for it ndash you will definitely be in for a memorable voyage of Discovery.gordonandmacphailNaked GrouseABV: %Price: poundAs I said in the introduction to this whole article,yoursquore after something truly memorable, you really donrsquot have to spend a fortune to get it hellipyou know where to look. And at under pound in some shops, the Naked Grouse is in my mind a must-have for any collection.Pour it for your whisky-loving friend ndash but donrsquot show them the bottle ndash and watch as they muse over the malty, toffee-sweet nose and rich fudgy, fruity flavour, topped off with a little spice, and tryto identy what high-end dram it belongs to.Soyoursquore looking for a superb, great-value dram, just remember one thing ndash sometimes less really is more.nakedgrouseTomatin -year-oldABV: %Price: poundAs you head up the A, by the time to reach Tomatin you know yoursquore in the Highlands. The bleak splendour of Drumochter and Dalwhinnie are miles behind the Cairngorms and Aviemore are a rapidly fading memory. Inverness isnrsquot far off, and from there itrsquos on to the wild lands of Ross and Caithness.Yoursquod expect a whisky here to have ruggedness its heart ndash to be as unforgiving as a northern winter. But no, not a bit of it. The climate round here is softer and more gentle than you might imagine ndash and the spirit thatrsquos born from this land reflects that.The Tomatin -year-old is smooth and silky, with a rich, fruity aroma coming from its traditional mix of ex-bourbon and ex-sherry casks. Itrsquos buttery at first, but there are also notes of marzipan. The flavours are powerful, but therersquos sweetness and richness, with oaky vanilla, ripe apples and pears. Hints of stem ginger and citrus add a tangy treat.Soyou ever thought the Highlands were bleak, think again. All you need to do is stop a while, look around you, and yoursquoll find a real gem hidden in the north.www.tomatinDouglas Laingrsquos Remarkable Regional MaltsABV: VariousPrice: From pound to poundI could choose one from this range, but really, therersquos no point. Quite simply,you try one you really should try them all, because theyrsquore as good a lesson in the dferent characteristics of Scotlandrsquos whisky regions as yoursquoll ever need. Theyrsquore a ready-made whisky collection.There are six names to look out for, and each blends together some of the best malts from its region to capture the unique character of each area.The fun, light Epicurean is the lowland offering, while rich,complex Speyside is represented by Scallywag.If you head into the Highlands, look out for Timorous Beastie, and slightly peated, slightly salty Rock Oyster is a island-inspired tidal wave.If yoursquore into a dram from Islay or Skye, why not try Big Beat , while the newest addition to the range,The Gauldrons, captures the unique, excellent power of Campbeltown.The range was launched with ldquobasic versions, but since then it has grown, and a host of special editions and extra expressions have turned these Regional Malts into a veritable reference library of whisky.So put on your reading glasses, pull up a chair and get studying. You will be tested at the end of the lesson.www.douglaslaingOld Pulteney HuddartABV: %Price: poundThis is a strange experience. Old Pulteney has been a favourite of mine for many, many years, but trying the Huddart ndash released just this year and named after the street in which the distillery sits ndash was like meeting the younger sister of my best pal that I didnrsquot know existed.I recognise her immediately, but at the same time shersquos so dferent from the friend I know and love.The Huddart is definitely an Old Pulteney ndash the saltiness and drtwood-on-a-beach coastal personality tell us that ndash but itrsquos been finished in casks which previously held peated whisky, and this gives it a wonderful far-off smokiness that adds a layer of real intensity to an already powerful dram.But therersquos a ton of richness too, with sweet vanilla balancing the intensity of smoke, and I loved the buttery, mouth-coating finish. This is definitely one to come back to on a cold, stormy night when I have some time on my hands, and the music player to myself. Van Morrison, I think.Huddart, itrsquos been a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I hope we run into each other again soon.www.oldpulteney.coTullibardine SovereignABV: %Price: poundAnd your starter for  ndash where do you think you would find the complete dram  The lush valleys of Speyside, perhaps  Or the rugged coast of Islay But whatI said just off theA on the way from Stirling to Perth Chances are yoursquoll have passed the Tullibardine distillery at one time or another. But did you know itrsquos one of the few in the country where every whisky-making process is done on-site Fermentation, distillation, maturation, and bottling ndash itrsquos all done here.This gives Tullibardine complete control over its whisky, and allows it to produce expressions like the Sovereign ndash a creamy, rich, delicious dram.On the nose, look for soft vanilla and cocoa butter, and when you taste it the richness builds with malt and hints of maple syrup, with a little extra helping of mixed peel and pears. The finish is all cream and vanilla with a touch of cinnamon-spice.For the whisky from the side of the A, itrsquos a definite A+ from me!www.tullibardine"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-can-parliamentary-sovereignty-find-the-exit-to-the-brexit-maze","story":"As the parliamentary moment of truth nears next month, the big question is: is there a way out of the Brexit maze that will leave the country in any way reasonably sane and intact The first thing to note is that the Conservative psychodrama that David Cameron nationalised by holding the  referendum in order to stem the flow of Tory support to Ukip will continue whatever happens. Parties are deeply ided as is the nation and this will not end come March .So is there a way out of the Brexit maze  Possibly. It is called parliamentary sovereignty the most important part of the UK constitution.It is through Westminster that laws are made and can be scrapped. And even though we now have a devolved system of government in Scotland, Wales, and, at times, Northern Ireland, the constitutional authority ultimately remains in SW.When on June   the UK voted to leave the EU, no one or very few people believed the country would leave the Brussels bloc on June .A process through Parliament had to be undertaken and a deal agreed by MPs.Through Article , the Government ndash via Parliament ndash set the time and date at pm on March . And, as we have recently seen, the European Court of Justice has ruled thatParliament wanted to, it could revoke the leaving date and keep Britain in the EU. But, of course, Theresa May and her colleagues have no intention of doing so.Butthe people accept that it is through Parliament that its will is enacted, then what happens when Parliament finds doing this is just impossible On December , the Prime Minister pulled the vote on her Brexit deal because she realised that it was going to be rejected, big time. So, she bought herself a bit of time to try to get the EU to tweak the agreement to give Parliament control over the Irish backstop.But, despite reports of high hopes that Brussels will at one minute to midnight blink, the general expectation is that Mrs Mayrsquos deal is looking for as big a rejection on January  as it would have done on December .So what happens  Parliamentary sovereignty kicks in.In normal times, the Government can control Parliament through its majority, or, as is the case at present, it does so with a little help from its friends. But when those friends do not agree and, as at present, a large chunk of her own party does not agree, what on earth does the PM do Resign and spark a general election  On the first point, it is obvious that no one can unite the Tories on Brexit so Mrs Mayrsquos departure would not solve the problem it could even exacerbate it. On the second, the last thing Conservative MPs want is another election they could lose it. Survival concentrates the mind.So, here goes. Faced with a humiliating defeat, the PM pulls the vote again or suffers the expected parliamentary rejection. Either way, she then says that it is now up to MPs to decide the way forward. As Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, recently pointed out: ldquoIt wasnrsquot the Government that was given an instruction by the referendum, it was Parliament.Mrs May says that a process has to be undertaken to find out where the centre of gravity lies in Parliament for the way forward on Brexit. So options are put before MPs: the possibly tweaked UK-EU deal Norway-Plus and no-deal.Now, of course, there will be some who insist a Peoplersquos Vote must also be an option yet the PM is strongly opposed to this. However, remember, Parliament is now in control. MPs would put forward an amendment to the Governmentrsquos options motion to include another referendum.It seems certain MPs would vote to include the Peoplersquos Vote option. In the vote, Mrs Mayrsquos deal get per cent support, no-deal , Norway-Plus and a Peoplersquos Vote .Now that Parliament is in control, the way forward is clear: the issue has to go back to the people.This, of course, would throw up its own process problems. The next EU elections are on May . Another referendum would probably have to take place before then, so the UK does not have to take part in the Euro-poll.This would mean fast-tracking the process of drawing up, debating and voting on a referendum bill and getting the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, to raty the process.How many questions should be on the ballot paper will be key but it will be for Parliament to decide. Chances are, it will be one choice: the UK-EU deal already agreed and staying in the EU no-deal would be off the table because most MPs believe it should be.Another issue that would be key would be the franchise. Should  and -year-olds be eligible as they were in the  Scottish referendum but as they were not in the  EU referendum  Parliament would decide.Of course, holding another poll would have people insisting this undermines democracy. Almost three years ago, the country voted in the biggest display of democracy it has ever seen to leave the EU. And now here the Establishment is subverting the will of the people.But our democracy works through Parliament not around it. Parliament has to find a mechanism to realise the will of the people. If it cannot, then it has only one option to go back to them for further instructions. Anda general election is not agreed upon, then the only recourse is another referendum set out in the terms agreed by - MPs.One of the biggest arguments for leaving the EU was for Parliament to take back control throughout this suggested route to the exit, MPs would have been in control all the way through.And once the people vote on the new options, then it will again be up to Parliament to enact their will.One can only hope that, second time round, it can do so whatever the result is."},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance-service-paying-32k-a-day-in-overtime-amid-staff-shortages","story":"On average, the Scottish Ambulance Service paid pound, a day in overtime to all staff - including managers, support staff and technicians - to work extra hours in .For paramedics alone, overtime was worth pound.m - the highest in five years, and up pound, in the space of a year.

This was brought home to me forcefully by the response to a book I reviewed in , Enlightenment Now by the Hard psychologist, Steven Pinker.Pinker is a long-haired, Jewish, liberal child of the s. Yet for claiming in his books that on almost every index of human progress - health and safety, longevity, ersity, poverty, war, crime ndash things are broadly-speaking getting better, he has been subjected to widespread criticism and even abuse. Pinker has been accused of being a sympathiser with the ldquoalt right by commentators and fellow academics.Yet, most of what he says is undeniably true, even commonplace. Not only has absolute poverty fallen globally by nearly two-thirds in the last three decades, people across the world are generally living longer, eating better, becoming happier and getting better education. Improvements in the quality of le testy to the long-term achievements of progressive movements of the mid th Century, like social democracy, womenrsquos rights, civil rights and anti-colonialism.World poverty continues to decline far faster than anyone could have imagined back in  when white-clad demonstrators encircled Edinburgh aiming to ldquoMake Poverty History. Absolute poverty, meaning le below the World Bankrsquos level of  a day, may now be eliminated entirely by the end of the next decade.We think of this as an age of terrorism, with events like the Westminster kne and lorry attacks and last yearrsquos Manchester bombings. But while there were  terrorism deaths in Western Europe last year, there were nearly twice as many, , as recently as . The reduction is largely down to better policing and intelligence .The vast majority of terrorist deaths occur in the Middle East, though even here the number of fatalities has dropped by nearly  per cent in a year. The number of terrorist deaths globally last year, ,, is less than the number of Americans killed by drug overdoses, according to the University of Marylandrsquos terrorism research centre.UK road accidents have declined by two-thirds since the early s even though there are far more cars on the roads. Workplace and domestic accidents and other ldquoacts of god are down by similar amounts. lsquoElf lsquonrsquo safety may be a standing joke ndash but it has worked.This doesnrsquot, of course mean that people are not starving, being killed in wars or are experiencing health problems. Governments need to reduce road accidents even further, and perhaps self-driving vehicles will do precisely that. Nor is talking of progress a reason to ignore modern scourges like domestic abuse, opioid addiction and mental illness. In western countries, wealth inequality has been allowed to grow alarmingly in the last three decades, and needs urgently to be reversed to prevent social dislocation.Climate change remains one of the most serious threats to the future of our species, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in October. Nor has the threat of nuclear war receded ndash indeed, Americarsquos abandonment of the INF intermediate nuclear weapons treaty in  has made the world a more dangerous place. But recognising that problems exist should not preclude recognition of actual progress. Some problems, like the depletion of the ozone layer or plastic pollution, can and will be resolved. Climate change can be tackled, but notwe wallow in catastrophism.Remarkable things are happening. Last month, Scotland produced  per cent of its electricity from renewables, mainly wind ndash something that would have been inconceivable  years ago. One of the largest energy companies, ScottishPower, has promised to end all fossil fuel generation. CO emissions last year in the UK were lower than in the s, even though population has more than doubled. Market analysts like Blackrock are forecasting big losses in oil and gas stocks as the world moves towards green energy. The worldrsquos biggest polluter, China, is emerging as a leading force in renewable energy.Remember Band Aid  The country that sparked the conscience of the world, Ethiopia, is now one of he fastest growing economies in the world at  per cent annually. There are signs that sub-Saharan Africa could be on the brink of the kind of development revolution that turned China into the second largest economy in the world in only  years.Some may fear that the belated development of Africa will only lead to more pollution and population pressure. But that neednrsquot be the case. We learned in  that the populations of half the countries in the world ndash the richest ones ndash are now declining quite rapidly, easing long-term pressure on the environment.Of course, we shouldnrsquot be complacent, but it is a perverse politics that wilfully ignores what has been achieved. That just leads to passivity and public apathy: nothing ever goes right the poor are always with us the system always wins. Itrsquos important to recognise that things can changewe want them to change further.Despite Brexit we live in tolerant times, vastly more civilised than even in the s, when racial discrimination was widespread and homosexuality was still illegal in Scotland. By winning elections and defending progressive policies like the NHS, the welfare state and public ownership, enlightened governments have immeasurably improved the lives of millions of ordinary people.So things arenrsquot as bad as they seem.

after ambitious plans to transform St Peters Seminary in Cardross into a cultural centre foundered, it looks likely to remain a forbidding modernist ruin for the foreseeable future.Architects have this week called for the A-listed building in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, an architectural masterpiece by Scottish architects Isi Metzstein and Andy MacMillan, to remain a ruin.For a decade the ground-breaking arts company NVA had appeared to have secured a new future for the lauded  building as an arts venue and, in long term plans, cultural centre.However, this year NVA, led by Angus Farquhar, has its long term funding from Creative Scotland cut in its controversial Regular Funding spending round, and the company closed this summer.St Peters, which appeared to have been saved from limbo, was seemingly cast back into perdition.Now the building, which has been a ruin longer than it was ever a seminary, is back in the hands of the Archdiocese of Glasgow, and this week a statement from the church offered no hope for the buildings long term future.It says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"For a time it seemed the empty building had a future le: NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in , and made a film with acclaimed artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term poundm project to transform the \"stabilised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.Since , NVA spent pound.m on the building, and organised a series of works, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of  vaults, improving paths, clearing away Rhododendron plants as well as other woodland management in the  acre site.It is now unclear what will happen to these works, and whether any more will be done in the future.The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the worlds most endangered cultural landmarks.Professor Alan Dunlop and Professor Johnny Rodger of the Glasgow School of Art said that its present form, as a ruin, is its most likely future.Professor Rodger, reader in urban literature at the GSA, said that the buildings original purpose as a secluded seminary for priests, had been rendered obsolete quite quickly by the Vatican  reforms in the Catholic Church from -.He added: \"It is a wonderful piece of structural virtuosity....but for the future, I have the idea of it as a ruin, maybe it is best left as a ruin, and a ruin to the hubris of modernism.\"It is not a place of pilgrimage, in reality is is quite inaccessible.\"Professor Rodger added: \"I remember going to Hinterland and speaking to someone there, saying I am not sure about this, its a lot of arts funding to spend in one place, its very isolated, just because of where it is.\"The irony is that it was built to train priests in isolation, and it will fail for that very reason.\"When NVA announced it was to close, Fiona Hyslop, the culture secretary, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study potential uses.The body has this week been tight lipped on its conclusions.However, the statement from the Archdiocese says: \"Over the decades we have tried everything to find a future for the former seminary.\"Its iconic status has, ironically, worked against it, as developers find it almost impossible to get the necessary permissions to bring the building back to le.\"We will continue to work with any group who want to look at providing some kind of future for the building. \"\"We have also spoken to the Scottish Government about our concerns and they have instructed Historic Environment Scotlandto carry out a review of the property with a view to securing the future of this architectural icon.\"A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland said: ldquoWe are working with the Scottish Government and the sitersquos owners to explore longer term options for St Peterrsquos seminary, which is a unique site of cultural signicance.Professor Alan Dunlop, a leading architect and academic, and a Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society of Arts, said: \"My own view is that the work of NVA should be consolidated, the site cleared and St. Peters left, as Isi Metzstein proposed, as a beautul ruin.\"Isi Metzstein said that he would enjoy the idea of St Peterrsquos Seminary being stripped of everything except the concrete and left as a ldquopurely romantic conception of the building as a beautul ruinHe added: \"Angus Farquhar of NVA, seemed to have the correct \" little by little\" approach, stating in  at a seminar in Glasgow organised by the Architects Journal that NVA would aim only to bring a small part of the seminary back to restoration: the chapel and the sanctuary adding that most of the rest of the space would simply be consolidated because of lack of funds and that the building was more interesting in its current state.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-only-a-second-eu-vote-can-save-our-parliamentary-sovereignty","story":"Parliamentary sovereignty must take precedence over our current Brexit-addled Government and, with the possibility of a General Election being remote, the only recourse democratically feasible is to hold a second referendum on EU membership.Jeremy Corbyns recent statement regarding his party winning a General Election in the new year and then re-negotiating a better Brexit deal than the present Governmentmust be filed under the heading \"deluded fantasy\" and is indicative of just how removed from reality his leadership of the Labour Party continues to be.It appears that doggedly pursuing the brainless and destructive path of Brexit is not simply the preserve of a zombie Prime Minister but also that of a zombie Leader of the Opposition.The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, who is increasingly looking like a future leader of her party, has embraced Realpolitik and admitted that a second referendum is \"plausible\". As Mr Settle points out in his analysis, only a second referendum has the chance of winning a majority in Parliament and is therefore the only path open to breaking the deadlock inflicted on us by Brexit.When Mrs Mays Brexit deal is finally defeated on January , even she will have to admit that, following a delay to the implementation of article , there can be no such thing as a managed no-deal and that a second referendum is the only solution that preserves parliamentary sovereignty.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.IT is disappointing to observe that the arguments by those who are in favour or against Brexit appear to be mostly driven by dogma or for possible political advantage by the MPs involved in the ious factions at Westminster rather than for us all to take a more pragmatic view of what is best for the country as a whole ndash within the general remit set by those who voted Leave in the UK-wide EU referendum.There also appears to a shocking lack of understanding about what is possible to be negotiated with Fortress Europe both in terms of an orderly Withdrawal Agreementand a final negotiated trading arrangement.Labour, for example says it could miraculously renegotiate the WA and would somehow remain in a customs union based on its belief that it would curry favour with the EU by being subservient to the EUs demands whilst on the other hand the SNP says it wants to be in the single market and the customs union. Surely to even a casual observer the above means Brexit in name only and would constitute a bad deal as we would become \"rule takers\" and be severely restricted to make fewindeed any bilateral trade deals with countries outside the EU. But when Labour is driven by wanting the Tories out and the SNP wants independence at any cost we have a problem for a sensible debate especially in a \"hung\" parliament. Then to complicate matters we have the relatively small but influential single-issue European Research Groupwho advocate a hardline Brexit and do not support an orderly withdrawal from the EU or any payment of the pound billion agreed by Mrs. May.Ian Lakin,Pinelands, Murtle Den Road, Miltimber, Aberdeen.BREXIT is such a serious issue that will affect our lives for years ahead that there must be an option in the January Parliament vote to give MPs to go for a complete withdrawal from Brexit and a referendum next year. They must go above party politics and recognise that the people, especially Scottish and Irish people who voted against it in  and certainly are not for it this time, can be given their voice.Everything has changed now. We now know what Brexit really means. This is being completely ignored by the PM, who is essentially blackmailing MPs to go for her deal with all the long-term consequences it will have.Alexander Boyd, Ormonde Avenue, Netherlee, Glasgow.PHILIP Adamsrefers to Iain Macwhirterrsquos reference to what Mr Adams calls the \"spurious mantra\" of Scotland voting overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. Far from being \"spurious\" or a \"mantra\", itrsquos a simple statement of fact which has profound signicance for those of us who wish to continue to benefit from membership of the EU.Unfortunately, however, Scotland is presently a member of a state which, to all intents and purposes, treats it as a sometimes useful but mostly to be ignored junior partner. Is Mr. Adams content to remain in that vulnerable, subservient position or does he not at least concede that Scotland will never have a chance of determining its own future without hindrance as long as the Westminster Parliament remains in overall control The numbers speak for themselves. Those MPs representing Englands constituencies vastly outnumber Scotlands contingent. Understandably, the former have their own constituentsrsquo wishes to consider and cannot be expected to show interest in affairs north of the Border. It has also become obvious in recent decades that Scotlandrsquos voters show support for progressive politics, whereas Englands voters seem to be content with a more conservative path. This widening split has become a chasm.Scotland may have been \"democratically outvoted\" in Mr Adamsrsquos eyes, but that is only because the UKrsquos political system is heavily weighted against it.Dave Stewart, Blairatholl Avenue, Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9218355.jpg?type=article-full","title":"advertising-feature-join-the-health-club-thats-not-just-for-january","story":"Thatrsquos where Glasgow Club can help you.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests. Cycling in front of a home crowd in London was just so much fun ndash the noise was ridiculous and I just didnt want to come off the track.\"He powered through the km four-lap race in m s, pipped by just a fraction of a second by the reigning world champion.Fin, who needs a leg brace to race, was quick to thank those who have shown faith in him, not least parents Dee and Drew who have backed his dream from the start and driven him thousands of miles around the country to compete. \"Without them, none of this would have happened,\" he said. \"They were able to come down to London to watch, which was very special.\"After being invited to talk to pupils at his former school, Fin said he shared his highs and lows and spoke of the importance of setting a target ndash even amidst setbacks such as his illness.A spokesman at Dingwall Academy said: \"Effort, resilience, embracing challenge, listening to feedback, never giving up and learning from failures were all great messages.\"His mum Dee, a childrens nurse, earlier told the Journal: \"We have no idea what the future holds.

That’s it over for another year.The presents are opened. The leftover vegetables are in the soup pot. The internet has been searched to find suggestions of what to do with all the ‘bits’ of roast turkey that are left. The children are less excitable than they were yesterday and have called a brief ceasefire. The shops are open again to get the batteries you forgot to buy. Today there is no pressure to provide a big meal so everyone can relax.Only  days to go ‘til we do it all again!Boxing Day is pretty much a British invention and in my humble opinion, it’s one that it is worth preserving. There are all sorts of theories about what exactly the ‘Boxing’ refers to, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has nothing to do with gloves and two people in a ring!Most people tie it in with gts given to tradesmen at Christmas which then merged into the staff in big houses being given boxes of goodies to take home to their family. Either way, Boxing Day is about looking outwards after a Christmas Day in which most people tend to focus inwards on their own families and loved ones. Boxing Day offers a balance to Christmas.A balance which is much needed not just in December but every day of the year.At a time when people are more aware than perhaps we have ever been, of what is happening down the street, across the town and in cities not only across our own nation, but across the world, we are in danger of knowing more but caring less.Partly that is because news reports tend to major on the bad and the sad things that are happening around the world to such an extent that we can find ourselves almost becoming desensitised to the heart-wrenching stories we hear because of the sheer volume of them.To respond to them all would mean literally, carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders – which is so hardnot impossible to do and maintain any degree of sanity. But to ignore all those dficult situations, plights and issues altogether and concern ourselves only with the things that directly affect us, is to cease to be human. At least, in my book!I suppose what I am saying is that we each need to pick, not our fights, but our causes. Having celebrated the blessings of having people to share Christmas with. Having had food to put on the table and a roof over our head. Having the wherewithal to buy others a present and receiving one or two, means we are very fortunate. You can be sure there are others in the immediate vicinity around us who have not been so lucky. All of us have neighbours who will not have been able to afford to eat a big, slap up Christmas meal: who cannot afford the electricity bill that Christmas lights would bump up. There are, on our streets, people who long for a dry place to sleep. There are children who will be going back to school who cannot say what Santa brought them because for them, there was no Santa. This is in st Century Scotland.In the world beyond, the needs are even greater with warring killing thousands and making so many more homeless and destitute. There are people of all ages, colours and creeds, picked on and used and abused in every corner of the world. There are regimes that are less than kind to the poorest and most vulnerable among their own people. Then there is the way we treat the world itself. I could go on, but I suspect your eye would wander from this column because it is all too much.And it is all too much.But we need to say and do something about at least some of these things since to stand by and do nothing, makes us complicit in the suffering others have to endure.I know it is not easy to care. I know it can be physically and mentally draining to bother about the needs and the issues that make le miserable for so many – but le is about helping each other. It is about carrying each other. It is about recognising that “there but for the grace of God…” Or to put it in a slightly more mercenary way, it’s realising thatthe boot was on the other foot we would want and expect others to come to our rescue.Boxing Day, when all the pressure is off, is a good time to sit down and think about what is important to you and to acknowledge that these same things are probably just as important to every other person on the planet.What is it you are most grateful for in le  Who is it that matters most to you  What is it that you cannot live without Please remember to give thanks for everyone and everything that adds to the richness of le’s experience. Please enjoy the good times and relish the memories you have as well as the people around you.But please too, look outwards and see what you can do to ensure that even just one other might find their le enriched in the way that yours has been.You can’t, I know, put such things in a box and hand it out. To do that though, would be even more precious than any other gt you could give.Be a blessing even as you are blessed.Rt Rev Susan Brown, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848056.1545553817!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm how twitter adversary became my friend and mentor","story":"Even in the heat of acrimonious political debate a friendship has emerged to keep me Young At Heart, writes Euan McColmIt began when the owner of an anonymous Twitter account told me he reckoned I was wrong about Scottish independence. What followed has been the stuff of dreams.Back in , as the debate over Scotland’s constitutional future became ever more fractious, I grew accustomed to receiving some fairly unpleasant messages and Tweets from keyboard warriors who saw my scepticism about the SNP’s proposal as a matter of considerable treachery. Often they’d want to know what I was being paid to espouse the views I didand, when they were referring to my trade, they’d be sure to put the word journalist inside inverted commas, lest anyone be in any doubt that the truth was I was nothing more than a shill.Every day, I’d block dozens of accounts – ,, at the last count – and get on with my “so-called” “journalism”. But when the owner of an account by the name of @ropoem popped up on my timeline to challenge something I’d written, he stood out. Unlike my usual correspondents from the Yes side of the tracks, he was polite and playful.And so I followed him back and enjoyed our little exchanges, which never ended in agreement but always passed in good humour. Occasionally, I’d wonder who this guy was we seemed, politics aside, to have a lot in common. I’d wonder, too, what he made of me. Before long, I was to find out exactly who he was and, it turns out, he thinks I’m not so bad.In , the owner of my local video rental place bought a job lot of ”singles that had previously been used in jukeboxes. There were boxes and boxes of the things, which he knocked out at p each or a quid for three. To a -year-old music fan of limited means, this was a treasure trove. Over a period of months, I bought dozens of s – among them such classics as Rip it Up by Orange Juice, Werewolves Of London by Warren Zevon and  Carat Love Affair by The Associates – that I cherish still. When the stock on display ran low, the shopkeeper would produce yet more boxes containing yet more gems and, thus, one Saturday afternoon I walked out of his place with three recent hit singles – Cath, I’m Falling, and Young At Heart – by The Bluebells. What a magnicent score.These records – I’m Falling, especially – have remained great favourites of mine throughout the ensuing decades. I know them intimately yet they retain the power to thrill me.So when a friend emailed me in  to say he’d noticed I seemed to be getting on pretty well online with Bobby Bluebell, I was surprised and delighted. This @ropoem bloke, it turned out, was the songwriting genius behind some of my favourite records.An invitation to watch The Bluebells play in Glasgow a few days after the independence referendum followed, and when Bobby dedicated Young At Heart to me from the stage, I was fully smitten.I can be awkward with new people but Bobby and I slipped into an easy friendship, opening up about times good and bad, and enthusing about the music we loved.Perhaps I was being a little cocky, \u2028but when my mate Kenny, a drummer, and I, a sort-of guitar player, began renting out a rehearsal room in Edinburgh to make a racket, I invited Bobby along,he wasn’t doing anything , mind, and it was okayhe couldn’t make it.Not only did he make it, but he gave generously, patiently listening to scraps of music I’d written, to half-realised rfs, and offering gentle and wise guidance. Usually, this would entail him suggesting the removal of unnecessary noodling and the focus on the essence of the song. I may have been a know-it-all newspaper columnist but I was a know-nothing novice songwriter and here was someone who’d written for some of the biggest names in popular music – he’s written for Brian Wilson, for heaven’s sake – acting as my mentor. Soon, I was in not one but two groups with Bobby. Last year, our group Best Picture released their first single, Isabelle, and last week our other band, Fat Cops, released their debut, Hands Up! Get Down!, a song written by Bobby, the band’s keyboard player Neil Murray, and me. It was named single of the week by BBC Radio Scotland’s Afternoon Show. Proud  You bet.For someone who bought his first single in  and still buys them, these have been truly magical moments. And underpinning these developments is a friendship that came out of the blue. Bobby and I still disagree about politics, of course, but the circumstances of our meeting act as a constant reminder in these horribly turbulent times that political disagreement needn’t be a barrier to an enduring human connection.On  March, , Fat Cops’ debut LP will be released. We’re proud of it. It’s better than any of us – Bobby, Neil, Chris, Bass Chris, Al and I – imagined it might be and we’re looking forward to playing gigs to promote it. But the music we’re making is only part of the story. Yes, I’m now realising an ambition I’ve harboured for four decades, but I am only able to do that because of this most surprising friendship.And when it comes down to it, friendship is what really matters, isn’t it  We might live in troubling times with political leaders who want to ide us and extremists who want to help them in that objective but,we’re lucky enough to have them, our friends will sustain us through the darkest days.When @ropoem popped up on my Twitter timeline to tease me about my columns, I could – touchy as I can be – have taken the huff and told him where to go.Instead, I found a dear friend who has had the most profound and positive impact on my le.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4843482.1545818499!/image/image.jpg","title":"no more boxing day fox hunts in scotland msp calls for tougher ban","story":"A Green MSP has plans to launch a consultation on a strengthened ban on fox hunting as annual Boxing Day hunts take place.Alison Johnstone believes the events are cruel and claims the current ban on hunting the animals in Scotland has “failed”. She is seeking a tougher ban in the new year. Fox hunting with dogs was banned in Scotland through the Protection of Wild MammalsAct in , with an exemption for using dogs to flush out foxes for pest control or protecting livestock or ground-nesting birds. Mounted hunts in Scotland have since offered farmers, landowners and estate managers a pest control service but a review by Lord Bonomy published in  found there were “grounds to suspect” fox hunting takes place illegally and he recommended having independent monitors.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"viking seeks update to install larger turbines ","story":"Viking Energy is applying to the Scottish government to increase the size of the turbines it has planned for the major windfarm development.Viking is seeking a iation to the current planning consent for an increase in maximum tip height of up to  metres, from m to m with a corresponding increase in the turbine hub height from  to m.The organisation says the change is intended to ensure the -turbine wind farm keeps up with the latest turbine technology, which, it says, has #advanced considerably# since the project launched more than  years ago.In order to keep up with the latest turbine technology , I propose they hold back for at least another  years, by which time I for one will be past caring#Despite the representation showing such a small increase in the height of the turbines, they will be almost an extra  feet which will give them an overall height of  feet. Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since. The ongoing tolerance of this is pathetic.I note with entirely no surprise the MOD is now objecting to Viking Energy turbines due to their inherent jamming and degradation of air defence radars and electronic warfare aircraft and missile trackers recently installed at Saxa. Surely the writing must now be on the wall for this turgid project. Is it not well overdue that the SIC and SCT cut their losses and abandon this expensive nonsense  Perhaps the dark cloud of Russian and Putin#s recent belligerence has a silver lining for Shetland  How very ironic..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England.

And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities. It features a youth leadership project and has a youth committee.Amie Mott, centre based youth worker for the Education Authority told theeveryone was excited for the opening.She said: The refurbishment is really lovely, and was greatly needed.“The young people have been using this building for  years so the enhancement was definitely needed.“In fact, some of the young people who are currently using the centre have told us their parents actually used it years ago, so in a lot of cases we are actually working with the second generation of Ballykeel young people!”Amie concluded by stressing the imporance and relevance of the centre to the community.She said: This is an important facility in the heart of Ballykeel, and we hope the new facilities will encourage even more young people to use the building.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jonathan Rea with his honorary degree from the University of Ulster at Belfasts Waterfront Hall“These others awards and occasions are new to me. It’s good that I have the support at home and actually moving back here is great timing.”Underneath his gown he was wearing a suit made by Isle of Man-based tailor The Noble Suitor. It was embroidered inside to read: ‘Made exclusively for Dr Jonathan Rea MBE’.The former Ballynure Primary School and Larne Grammar pupil said: “I’ve been back a few times to assemblies and to talk to the kids.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8741643.1545039707!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Age NI says a recently launched Department of Health review of emergency health care # with a particular focus on pensioners # is #a bit late in the day# for this winter and #should have started months ago#.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"driver caught doing 151mph in northern ireland 10 worst speeding","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last year Ms Cahill ended up in hospital on a drip after contracting flu, and wanted to ensure she was vaccinated. \"I called into Boots at Sprucefield and the girl behind the counter said: No, weve run out, the stock is completely gone. \"And we have been trying to get a flu jab for my grandmother for the past two months.\"In my family, the only one who has actually been vaccinated is my daughter - who got it at her school.\"The PHA said it expects figures from early next year to reflect an increase in numbers receiving the flu jab.Dr Jillian Johnston, consultant in health protection at the PHA, stressed that the latest available figures would not reflect flu clinics which took place in early December, \"especially for those over  years of age\".\"We anticipate that our uptake will improve in the end of December and end of January s,\" she said.She also urged all those eligible for the jab to ensure they avail of the vaccine each year as the flu virus is \"unpredictable\" and strains can \"y from year to year\".She added: \"The vaccine is still the best protection people can have from flu this winter.\""},{"url":null,"title":"watch grieving granddad gets puppy for christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_bec-f-d-c-b_EmailJapan has announced it is leaving the International Whaling Commissionto resume hunting the animals for commercial use but said it will no longer go to the Antarctic..pushChief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the hunts will be limited to Japan’s territorial waters and its -mile exclusive economic zone along the country’s coasts, and that Japan will stop its annual whaling expeditions to the Antarctic and north-west Pacic oceans.Japan will resume commercial whaling in July  after a -year absence “in line with Japan’s basic policy of promoting sustainable use of aquatic living resources based on scientic evidence,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Japan says it is leaving the International Whaling Commission to resume commercial hunts “Regrettably, we have reached a decision that it is impossible in the IWC to seek the coexistence of states with dferent views,” Mr Suga said.Mr Suga said the IWC has been dominated by conservationists and Japan was disappointed over its efforts to manage whale stocks even though the IWC has a treaty mandate for both whale conservation and development of the whaling industry.The IWC imposed a commercial moratorium in the s due to a dwindling whale population.Japan switched to what it calls research whaling and says stocks have recovered enough to resume commercial hunt.The research programme was criticised as a cover for commercial hunting as the meat is sold on the market at home.Japan has hunted whales for centuries, but has reduced its catch following international protests and declining demand for whale meat at home.The withdrawal from the IWC may be a face-saving step to stop Japan’s ambitious Antarctic hunts and scale down the scope of whaling to around the Japanese coasts.Fisheries officials have said Japan annually consumes thousands of tons of whale meat from the research hunts, mainly by older Japanese seeking a nostalgic meal.But critics say they doubt commercial whaling could be a sustainable industryJapanese young people do not see whales as food.Mr Suga said Japan will noty the IWC of its decision by December  and remains committed to international cooperation on proper management of marine living resources even after its IWC withdrawal.Environmental group Greenpeace condemned the decision and disputed Japan’s view that whale stocks have recovered, saying that ocean le is being threatened by pollution as well as overfishing.PRESS RELEASE: Greenpeace condemns Japan government’s “sneaky” withdrawal from the International Whaling Commissionhttps:t.co PaSzMVlg— Greenpeace NZDecember , “The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures.“The government of Japan must urgently act to conserve marine ecosystems, rather than resume commercial whaling,” Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan, said in a statement.The Australian government, often a vocal critic of Japan’s whaling policies, said it was “extremely disappointed” with Japan’s decision to quit the commission.However, Australia and New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters welcomed Japan’s withdrawal from the southern ocean."},{"url":null,"title":"pope urges fraternity among people all over world during christmas

Addressing tens of thousands of tourists and pilgrims in St Peters Square yesterday, Francis said that the universal message of Christmas was that \"God is a good Father and we are all brothers and sisters\". Without fraternity, the pope said \"even our best plans and projects risk being soulless and empty\". He added that \"our dferences, then, are not a detriment or a danger they are a source of richness\". Francis made his appeal as trends toward nationalism, fuelling suspicion of migrants and refugees, have gained traction in much of the developed world. The pope also called for dialogue among Israelis and Palestinians so they can \"undertake a journey of peace\". Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury used his Christmas Day sermon to highlight the importance of forgetting \"tribalism\" and \"political advantage\". The Most Rev Justin Welby told worshipper that the \"language of love\" is spoken by God \"for the poor and suffering and oppressed in every place at every time\". The archbishop told the congregation: \"Gods language of love is exclusive. \"It requires us to forget other languages of hatred, tribalism, rivalry, political advantage and of materialism, pride, greed, and so many more.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"derry couple give christmas gift nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

I was frustrated by housing prices. “The idea of living in a converted double decker bus was essentially a housing solution.The inside of the bus before the start of the conversion“I got it off a businessman from just outside Liverpool who was selling them. He brought the bus to Heysham and got it ferried over to Warrenpoint. “From there it was driven to where it is now.”Jack’s plans to live in the bus changed shortly after he began work on the vehicle.He said: “I’ll be close to the limit of my budget by the end of this first phase so at the moment it seems more feasible to rent it out.”The inside of the bus after the conversionJack said the target market would be glampers – a term coined for people who like camping-style trips in more luxurious surrounds than a tent.He commented: “You would make more from renting it out to holiday makers rather than renting it as an actual dwelling. “The requirements for accommodation that is lived in  days of the year are very dferent to somewhere that is rented out for short periods to lots of dferent people.Discounted rail and bus fares continue to aid ‘recovery’ after Primark fire Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“By renting it out to glampers – for example via airbnb – I’d be able to recoup some money and explore other possibilities.“I’ve looked at other people who have converted buses over in England and they seem to be doing very well with renting them out.“I might as well give it a go. As far as I’m aware it will be the first converted double decker bus in Ireland so that’s definitely a selling point.”Jack – a university student who spent a couple of years working in a power station – said he’d had the bus for around  months. He hopes to have made the vehicle habitable by early next year.Jack said: “The issue is finding somewhere to put it before finishing it off. “It’s the land that is the expensive part. That’s more of an issue than the bus conversion itself.“I’m renting out the yard that it’s in now month by month.“I don’t have anywhere permanent to put it the moment.“I’m looking for a site or trying to find someone who wanted to go into partnership and would be interested in putting it on their site.“Ideally I’d like to have it in a permanent location before starting to rent it out.”Of the work that has been done on the bus and still needs to be carried out he said: “On the outside I have to take off the advertising sign and repaint it. “I’m going to keep it the same colour of green. “Inside I’m keeping some original features like the driver’s seat, steering wheel and dashboard. “I’ve kept some of the rails people would hold onto when the bus is moving.“I’ve taken all the seats out and the poles. I’m thinking of maybe using one of the ‘stop’ bells from the poles as a front door bell. I’ve also kept all the seats in storage with a view to do something with them at a later date.” In terms of new additions he said: “I’ve got the kitchen put in and the beds in. I need to do soft furnishings, carpets, blinds, sofas, etc .“I need to put in a toilet and a wood burner but I can’t put those in until it’s sited. You couldn’t move it with those fitted. The wood burner would probably be too heavy and the ceramics could break in transport.”Jack, who lives with his parents Jim and Liz and his sister Alison, is trying to keep the project environmentally friendly.He said: “I did Environmental Science at university over in Nottingham. “After that I worked in a power station for two years doing environmental management.“I saved up money from that job to be able to do this. I try to be as environmentally conscious as possible. I’ve tried to keep the bus project as carbon low as possible.” He added: “I saved £, and gave myself a budget of £,.“The bus cost £,, at the moment I’m into about £, conversion costs, so I’m hoping to be within the £, costs by the end of it.“I’ve had the bus for about a good year and a half, but most of the work has been done inside  months. “I should have it fully operational by early next year.“I’d say it would take two months once it’s sited for plumbing, electricity, etc.”Jack said planning permission to live in a vehicle was a “grey area”.“If you have a motorhome you can have it on your property for up to  days without planning permission, butit’s going to have plumbing and electricity then it will need the necessary permissions,” he said.“A double decker bus is still classed as a vehicle so you can park it at your houseyou have the room.“The ultimate goal would be for my bus to be self-contained – with solar , a wood burner to heat it, its own water supply and an above ground waste container. Planning permission would be needed for that.”You can follow Jack McGrath’s bus conversion on social media at: • www bus_tale• www.facebook Jacks-Bus-Tale-• www.instagram jacks.bus.taletry catch  TrendingPictures: Royals attend Christmas Day church service at Sandringham, minus Prince PhilipSinn Fein poll slump is new setback for Mary Lou McDonaldSteel and Sons Cup Final:East Belfast lt trophy after win over Sirocco WorksYear in Review: Michael Dunloprsquos Isle of Man TT trebleThieves stealing directly from shoppersrsquo trollies, DUP MP tells police          ..

So my mind was a bit screwed up, I became a dferent character.”He later moved to Mourneview in Lurgan as the Troubles erupted.“People got very worried and I got misled into things. But I started to think – ‘this is ok because I am getting attention because of what I was doing’, but I was very misled.”Youngsters on both sides were fighting and the IRA left a bomb in his estate, he said.“I felt very sad and very aggressive towards everything, not just because of the Troubles but because of what was going on with me, being abused and so on. “I got terribly involved and of course the older ones mislead the youngsters, and me being a youngster with no sense and both my parents being deaf and dumb, I just thought it was the right thing to be getting on with.”Although only , as a UDA member he drove the lb bomb by car to Edwards Street in Lurgan, where he was told four IRA men were meeting.“I lit the fuse and it went out, but God intervened and he said to me ‘thou shalt not kill’ and the fear of God came upon me.”He did not try to relight it.In full: Text of the Queen’s Christmas broadcast in which she refers to faith, family and conflict Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Nobody got killed and nobody got hurt but it would have caused an awful lot of upset.“They were taking advantage of me. Of course they were. A young fella going to blow up a street, thinking it is going to be all right. Imaginethat bomb had gone off. I would probably still be in prison or it could have killed me.”He fled to England, where he now lives, but later served two years in jail and borstal.“I was a Marxist, I was a communist, I got involved in the drugs scene a bit. My le was a total mess. I had no idea how to live le because of what happened to me. But then I became a Christian, aged , and my le changed.”He now has a message for teenagers in NI going down the path he did.“Stop. Think. Read my book. See what can happen and where you can end up. And remember it is never the guys who are telling you what to do that get in trouble it is you that gets in trouble.“Prison was unbelievable. I was locked up for  hours a day. I was beaten up and all sorts of stuff in prison.“The criminal record never goes from you. So when you go for a job you have to declare itthey ask you your past. You are not covered by the rehabilitation act for this act.“So I would say to the youngsters of NI, ‘you are known all over the world as the most hospitable people there ever was, so look at each other in the same light as the world looks at you.“And get on together guys and leave the Troubles to the past.

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up. It has grown and grown ever since. Even in January February there were - people turning up each week.“At our anniversary swim in October we had  people taking part.“There seems to be a push towards more outdoor activity, I think people intuitively know that it’s good for them, and maybe a societal sht where back in the day kids used to go out and get involved in nature, then computers came along and people got more indoor-oriented, but now the pendulum is shting back and people are realising that getting outdoors makes you happier, healthier and stronger.”try catch  TrendingMissing person found safe and wellEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceGalgorm Resort and Spa evacuatedTwo stabbed: Man arrested on suspicion of attempted murderBrit-bashing by Irish will not change: Wilson          ..

the Christmas Day morning church service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, Norfolk today, a few hours before her Christmas broadcast . Photo: Joe Giddens PA WireNoting that the Commonwealth consists of  member countries, she said: “Even with the most deeply held dferences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.”The Queen concluded her broadcast by highlighting Jesus’s message: “I believe his message of peace on earth and goodwill to all is never out of date.”Here is the full text of the Queen’s Christmas Day message:“For many, the service of Nine Lessons and Carols from King’s College, Cambridge, is when Christmas begins. Listened to by millions of people around the world, it starts with a chorister singing the first verse of Once in Royal David’s City.“The priest who introduced this service to King’s College chapel, exactly one hundred years ago, was Eric Milner-White. He had served as a military chaplain in the First World War. Just six weeks after the Armistice, he wanted a new kind of service which, with its message of peace and goodwill, spoke to the needs of the times.“Twenty eighteen has been a year of centenaries. The Royal Air Force celebrated its th anniversary with a memorable fly-past demonstrating a thrilling unity of purpose and execution. We owe them and all our Armed Services our deepest gratitude.“My father served in the Royal Navy during the First World War. He was a midshipman in HMS Collingwood at the Battle of Jutland in . The British fleet lost  ships and , men in that engagement. My father wrote in a letter: ‘How and why we were not hit beats me’. Like others, he lost friends in the war.Archbishop Welby in Christmas plea for God’s language of love, not tribalism or political advantage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“At Christmas, we become keenly aware of loved ones who have died, whatever the circumstances. But, of course, we would not grievewe did not love.“Closer to home, it’s been a busy year for my family, with two weddings and two babies, and another child expected soon. It helps to keep a grandmother well occupied. We have had other celebrations too, including the th birthday of The Prince of Wales.“Some cultures believe a long le brings wisdom. I’d like to think so. Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognise some of le’s baffling paradoxes, such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil. Even the power of faith, which frequently inspires great generosity and self-sacrice, can fall victim to tribalism.“But through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance.“In April, the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in London. My father welcomed just eight countries to the first such meeting in . Now the Commonwealth includes  countries with . billion people, a third of the world’s population.“Its strength lies in the bonds of affection it promotes, and a common desire to live in a better, more peaceful world. Even with the most deeply held dferences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.“Indeed, the Commonwealth Games, held this year on Australia’s Gold Coast, are known universally as the Friendly Games because of their emphasis on goodwill and mutual respect.“The Christmas story retains its appeal since it doesn’t provide theoretical explanations for the puzzles of le. Instead it’s about the birth of a child and the hope that birth , years ago brought to the world. Only a few people acknowledged Jesus when he was born. Now billions follow him.“I believe his message of peace on earth and goodwill to all is never out of date. It can be heeded by everyone it’s needed as much as ever.“A very happy Christmas to you all.”try catch  TrendingSinn Fein poll slump is new setback for Mary Lou McDonaldThieves stealing directly from shoppersrsquo trollies, DUP MP tells policeMan dies in Christmas Eve house firePolice unable to wake unconscious femalePictures: Royals attend Christmas Day church service at Sandringham, minus Prince Philip          ..

That night my heart shattered into a million pieces as I’d lost my soul mate, best friend and the love of my le.“We’d known each other since we were . We’d been together for  years.“When Alison died I needed something to focus on, something to get me through it. Going on the Everest challenge meant I had to plan my year out. I was able to focus on the training and the fundraising.”Of the Himalayan trek he said: “We had a couple of days in Kathmandu then flew to Lukla – the most dangerous airport in the world. It has wee single planes landing on the airstrip, stopping before they hit the mountain.“From there we had a -day trek. Eight days up to the base camp and four days down.“Basecamp is at , metres. If you were to go on and do the summit you have to stay at base camp for three or four weeks to acclimatise.“You need to be a skilled mountaineer to do that. I was happy with the achievement of reaching base camp. Not everybody gets to do that. It was a nice achievement.”He added: “You don’t actually see Everest from base camp because it’s blocked out by the mountains around it.Revealed: Top  fastest speeding drivers in Northern Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I’ll be honest, the base camp itself was a wee bit of an anti-climax. Because it wasn’t peak season there were no tents there, it was just barren land.“If you were going when they were summiting it would be like a village.”Hayden, who runs a sportswear business, said: “It was a great experience. Very physically, emotionally and mentally draining.“There were six people from the group of  who didn’t make it to base camp so it was by no means an easy feat.”Hayden’s sister Allyson, who had suggested he go on the trek, was one of those who did not make it to the base camp, having been struck down with a chest infection in the final straight.try catch  TrendingPictures: Royals attend Christmas Day church service at Sandringham, minus Prince PhilipSinn Fein poll slump is new setback for Mary Lou McDonaldSteel and Sons Cup Final:East Belfast lt trophy after win over Sirocco WorksYear in Review: Michael Dunloprsquos Isle of Man TT trebleThieves stealing directly from shoppersrsquo trollies, DUP MP tells police          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Most will still have their work cut out to persuade shoppers who have notably been clawing back their spend.ldquoBut for those retailers stocking must-have brands, there is still plenty to play for in the final festive push.David Pierotti, general manager at Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow, said: ldquoAttracted by the thrill and discounts available, Scots are continuing to take the sales seriously with early birds queuing outside Next from am this morning with Zara also proving to be incredibly popular with our shoppers today.Ryan Manson, general manager at Union Square in Aberdeen, said there has been a lot of demand for its cinema and restaurants on Boxing Day, adding: ldquoTherersquos been several big new film releases recently, including Mary Poppins Returns, Aquaman, and Spiderman into the Spider-Verse, which are proving a major draw.Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer Europe and group director of brand and strategic marketing for Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns the Westfield London and Stratford City shopping centres, said: ldquoBoxing Day is always one of our peak trading days and has got off to a very busy start with over , people through doors by am this morning..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Bargain hunters out in force early for Boxing Day sales article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentSort comments byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...SuspendLast Updated: ReplyQuote  EditDeleteReport wrote:Post reply Save commentCancel Are you sure you want to delete this comment Yes, delete the commentNo, keep the commentReport This CommentThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
