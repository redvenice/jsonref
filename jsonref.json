Henri Kisielewski is the 2019 recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyFado is Lisbon’s urban folk music, born in and around the brothels, alleyways and ​tascas ​of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fado is to Lisbon what the Blues are to the Delta. Written records trace it back to the early 19th century, though some argue it is much older, connecting it to oral traditions imported from across the Portuguese empire.At the heart of fado is ​saudade.​ This elusive word – apparently untranslatable from the original Portuguese – broadly refers to a sense of sorrow, of yearning, and a resigned desire for what once was. This is the underlying emotion of all fado and perhaps of Lisbon itself.Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest surviving neighbourhood: a maze of medieval and moorish architectures arranged in a patchwork of steep cobbled alleyways and red-clay roofs, rising up from the Tagus river. Once a close-knit fishing community, it is now the heart of Lisbon’s tourist industry.A decade ago, struggling to recover from a deep recession, Portugal’s government turned to tourism and opened the real-estate market to foreign speculation. Today, more then half of all accommodation in Alfama is destined for tourism and thousands of long-standing residents have been priced out of the city centre. One after another, the shops that catered to the local community closed to make way for tourist-facing businesses – many of which are “fado restaurants” – and now Alfama feels more like a theme park than a living neighbourhood. This touristification is affecting much of the city​.​ If things keep going the way they are, one journalist wrote in 2016, Lisbon will soon have to hire extras to play Portuguese people in its streets.In 2019, I spent a month in Lisbon exploring the complicated relationship between fado and tourism. On one hand, fado is often upheld as the essence of Lisbon, an incorruptible mainstay in a rapidly changing city. On the other, it is the main attraction for many of the city’s 4.5 million visitors and is increasingly commodified to meet this demand.A recurring feature in many fados is Lisbon itself, in particular what it used to be. In its long history, many forces have played a hand in altering the city and its social fabric, the destructive 1755 earthquake being a key example. Today’s aggressive touristification is another seismic event, the full impact of which is yet to be fully understood.In many cases, the allusions within fado’s poems refer to both a real and an imagined history, both a concrete remembrance and an imprecise, idealised version of the way things were. In fado, truth and fiction coexist, history and myth are tangled.There is a parallel between this ambiguous relationship to the city, past and present, and the experience of modern tourism. In ​Invisible Cities,​ Italo Calvino describes travellers visiting the fictional metropolis of Maurilia. They are invited to accompany their experience of the present with the help of old postcards that depict how Maurilia once was, the “postcard city” being key to appreciating the city as it now stands.Travellers​ arrive in a location hoping that it will live up to what they had imagined, and are quicker to see the postcard city than the place itself. Over time, the place changes to fit this imagined expectation. It’s paradoxical, wrote the mayor of Barcelona in 2014, but uncontrolled mass tourism ends up destroying the very things that made a city attractive to visitors in the first place.This is particularly obvious in Lisbon, where the sheer speed of change and lack of oversight have magnified the problem. Once the locals have left, once all the menus are in English and, when looking down the ancient, winding alleyways to the waterfront, one is more likely to see the hulking mass of a cruise ship than the water of the Tagus river, what remains is a longing for what has been lost – whether real or imagined. What remains is saudade​.In an anonymous back street, far from the tourist gaze, there is one establishment like no other: a small fado house in a former Italian restaurant where fadistas meet once their tourist-facing engagements are done with. It’s an institution in Lisbon’s underground scene, open from midnight to 6am, and not featured in any guidebooks. I have been asked not to name it for fear that a surge in popularity might affect its delicate ecosystem.Inside, old fado legends glance out from yellowed posters in crooked frames and black funereal shawls – traditionally worn by female fadistas – hang proudly among them like team scarves in a football clubhouse. Thick red curtains cover the windows and the blue formica floor tiles have turned a minty green from decades of bleach and wine.This is the home of​ fadovadio,​ where amateurs and professionals take turns interpreting the canon. It is not uncommon to see a performance by a taxi driver followed by a well-known fadista, and then a butcher’s wife. One regular performer is a respected professor of Medieval bureaucracy.Any mention of this place elicits amused disdain from the owners and staff of the more “respectable” fado houses f​adovadio ​is not serious, they will say.​ ​But it is known to them all and they, too, can be spotted here on occasion, drinking from the source.Manuelo is the master of ceremonies, a prickly and charismatic octogenarian who made a name for himself in fado circles in the mid-60s. Donna Lena, his Russian wife, is a striking blond of ferocious energy. She spends each night serving drinks, making food and tending to the guests’ every need. Donna Lena and her husband are the adoptive parents of Lisbon’s fado community. The story goes that she ran away from the Soviet ballet to marry him when on tour in Portugal. But, here too, myth and history are tangled.At 2am, the performances are about to begin and the air is thick with smoke and anticipation. Beyond the laughter and chatting, one can make out the gentle cacophony of string instruments being tuned.During each set, the fadista performs four or five pieces. Lulled by wine and the red-tinged darkness, the audience is gradually swept up by the music, taken on a hazy voyage that evokes homesick sailors, despairing lovers and death. Some rest their heads in their hands, others stare wistfully into space. There is always at least one person who closes their eyes and falls into a deep sleep.One Saturday, around 5am, Marta Rosa appeared at the door with her small entourage. We had been introduced early in my stay and she proved invaluable in helping me navigate the intricacies of Lisbon fado.Donna Lena was tallying up the night’s damage for a customer with wine-stained lips. An old woman was handing Manuelo a framed picture of herself for the wall.Aside from the table of white-haired men arguing over a card game, the fadistas had the place to themselves. Marta joined the others in the back an L-shaped section of the room that is the domain of the performers.Five or six musicians and a handful of singers were sitting around the wonky tables that had, over the years, been demoted from the main room. By pivoting my chair I was now on the fringes of this new circle. I remember thinking it was a fitting place for me: neither a fadista nor a guest an interloper of sorts, a tourist who looks down on other tourists.There was a loud dissonant jumble, like a music lesson before the teacher arrives. Marta removed her coat and stood with her chin raised, her hands clasped tight in front of her. Then someone played the opening melody of Amália Rodrigues’ Ai Mouraria,​ and the cacophony fell silent. Donna Lena switched off the lights and accompaniment soon came from two sides as Marta began to sing.Her voice was soft to begin with. She floated through the high notes with a plaintive vibrato, squeezing emotion out of every drooping cadence. Then her song grew more forceful. By the end, it filled the whole room as she raised her chin higher, revealing the taught muscles in her neck.Almost as soon as the piece was over, amidst a few friendly heckles, a new one took off on another table. Poems succeeded each other in this frenzy into the early morning with different permutations, styles and rhythms, each singer owning the room in their own way. Occasionally, during a song, the words ​“O Fado” escaped someone’s mouth like a libation, in a voice both hushed and loud. This, I came to learn, was the signal that fado was happening.​Ricardo Ribeiro, one of the icons of modern fado, had explained it to me as a “manifestation”, a moment when everything comes together and all present share a sort of metaphysical communion. When the instruments disappear to leave only music, he had said, and the words disappear to leave only feeling, that is fado.On my last night in Lisbon, I walked down towards the centre of Alfama. I passed a wall near a shuttered restaurant where the words “Locals Welcome” had been thinly painted over and new grafitti had appeared: “Welcome Locals”.During my stay, I saw fado in cramped apartments and concert halls, street corners, ballrooms and sticky-floored taverns where tourists queued at the door. I visited evening classes in a suburb of tower blocks where a new sense of community has formed around fado. I attended a fundraising concert for a disabled girl where fado was the order of the day.The roots of fado run deep in Lisbon and that doesn’t seem likely to change. More than once I heard of the three F’s that make up the Portuguese spirit: Fado, Futebol, Fátima.Just as it survived the censorship and co-opting of the Salazar regime, fado’s essence will likely survive the effects of mass tourism. In fact, singing a more predictable version to tourists allows the majority of fadistas to live from their craft and in turn, allows “real” fado to survive.Trying to make sense of it all, I kept coming back to what Ricardo Ribeiro had said. He wasn’t interested in the distinction between “real” fado or tourist fado, commodification or authenticity only that once in a while, wherever it might be, fado h​appened.​Beside the church of Sao Miguel, the terraces of three restaurants share a sloping square around an old palm tree. In a doorway, a large woman was singing an epic fado about desire, loss and revenge, but her heart wasn’t in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083ab0d7ac203a54c32ec227e4822fce0294b34d/62_667_2998_1796/master/2998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebf3230955943482493205e92b696bdf","title":"ten best music biographies","story":"Addiction, poetry, flirting with Scientology: these candid memoirs and biographies reveal the inner lives of musicians(Faber \u0026amp Faber, 2014)A no-nonsense sojourn through Albertine’s life as guitarist in the Slits and, later, as a film-maker, mother and orcee, and during which she blithely chats about masturbation, catching crabs and giving Johnny Rotten a blowjob.

Unless lawmakers step in, the money stops on 31 July.Republicans, as a result, have warned of hordes of people “disincentivized” from returning to work. But economists say the real crisis is what happens when those same people have $2,400 less each month to pay for bills, rent and groceries.Sara Gard has been furloughed since April from her hospitality job, and said without the $600, she and her two children will be entirely dependent on her husband’s pay.“It’s not going to cover everything, so what’s going to give?

But without the $600 boost, she will have to give up the furlough protections to take a new job near her home in Atlanta.“It is such a feeling of being caged and trapped, and every decision I can make is a bad one,” Gard said.Gard, 39, is her family’s breadwinner, and she said she would return to her job for less money if it meant she could continue collecting the $600. An added stress for Gard is that at the same time the $600 expires, she is scheduled to also lose state unemployment insurance because of caps on how long people can collect it.While the benefits deadlines loomed, Gard was also forced to decide by 10 July whether to send her two-year-old and five-year-old children to school or have them take classes online in the fall.She tries to compartmentalize the different issues, but said: “It just stops working at some point, because every possibility ends in: if only someone had done something four months ago, I wouldn’t have to be trying to decide if I give up my kindergartner as tribute or what? Or decide that I’m going to not work, but if I do that, do I lose my house? Everything is one domino touching another. It’s just awful.”The domino effect goes beyond Gard’s family. More than a million people have filed new unemployment claims each week for 16 weeks – women, particularly women of color, are bearing the brunt of the losses. When millions of families have less money to spend, it strains the country’s economy.Abruptly ending the expansion could cost 2 million jobs by the end of the year, economist Jason Furman warned a House committee in June. The Economic Policy Institute estimated 5 million jobs could be lost by July 2021 if it is cut.There is also a public health threat if people are forced to return to work in a pandemic which has killed more than 137,000 Americans because they can’t get by without unemployment benefits.For safety reasons, Samantha Acuna would like to be at home. She is instead working on-call shifts as a cocktail server at a casino pool in Las Vegas where customers are not required to wear masks.She lives with her parents and her mother has asthma, but people can’t turn down the job they had before the pandemic and still collect benefits, unless they meet specific guidelines.Acuna gets the $600 boost pro-rated to the days she doesn’t work, but if that money disappears, she’ll have to find a full-time job so she can continue to pay for rent, her car, student loans and phone bills.“The pandemic is just going to get worse if we don’t pay attention to it,” Acuna said. “So I would just rather keep that income so I could be home and this could all just finish quicker.”Democrats have introduced legislation that would extend the program, with limits. Republicans have said they are against the $600, but have not said what they would replace it with.Both parties have been on a two-week recess which ends on Friday – two weeks before the program’s official expiration on 31 July. For most people, however, payments actually stop a week earlier.The $600 expansion is far from perfect, but it is a welcome solution in a country with antiquated and underfunded unemployment systems, which have left millions without benefits months after filing claims. In Alabama, people slept overnight in a parking lot so they could speak with a representative from the state’s unemployment agency.Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the not-for-profit National Employment Law Project, said: “We’ve systemically gutted every other piece of the social safety net, unemployment insurance too.”Evermore said since the last recession, state governments have made benefits more difficult to access and reduced the amount of benefits. The Cares Act, which included the $600 expansion, papered over these problems.Without it, they are likely to come back in full force.“When systems are set up with the aim of catching people, trapping people, cutting off people, you can’t just turn that around overnight when you want to pay benefits quickly,” Evermore said.She said the persistent myth that people collect unemployment to take advantage of the system ignores how important the benefit is for the national economy. “This is a system that has been undermined for a while, and this is the moment we can use to put in place permanent reforms, now and forever,” said Evermore.In mid-March, Karen Kent was laid off from her job as a cafeteria worker in New Jersey. She has been looking for jobs because without the $600 she will have to find work. But so far, her searches have only turned up jobs with direct customer contact, something she can’t face because she has asthma and a heart condition.The $600 has been a “lifesaver” for Kent, 47. Her husband is still working, but it is not enough to support the family. He also lost a part-time job at a restaurant which he had so his family could get dental insurance.“This was starting to give me a foot back in the door to have hope, I felt like I was working towards something, and they just want to take it away,” Kent said. “I work hard. I am a workhorse.”Kent is a fighter. She corners politicians at public events and rallies people on social media, but she is concerned that the situation she and others face is not reaching the political class. Kent said: “I feel like they need the working class, but we’re getting beaten down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c8a0b3602e71a560c3167da7562eb4b8faa099/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9a984f4fc0d035c11ba07ae55f58d94","title":"cadbury to shrink size of wispa gold and double decker bars","story":"Decision, which also applies to Boost and Bournville Classic, will only affect multipack itemsCadbury is shrinking the size of Double Decker and Wispa Gold bars sold in multipacks so they contain less than 200 calories in an attempt to help tackle obesity, but the smaller bars will cost the same.Cadbury, owned by the US confectionery group Mondelēz International, said multipacks accounted for the biggest slice of its chocolate sales and the change would eliminate 10bn calories from the UK market in one fell swoop.The company said it was offering more portion control options by voluntarily committing to bring all Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks under 200 calories by the end of 2021. The list of products being reduced in size includes Wispa Gold, Double Decker, Boost and Bournville Classic. However, there will be no change to the size of the bars sold inidually.A spokesperson for Cadbury said: “The list price for these products will not be changing at this time. Retail pricing remains at the retailer’s sole discretion.”The practice of reducing product sizes but maintaining prices effectively increases their cost per ounce and is known as “shrinkflation”.The confectionery group has already promised to reduce the serving size of treats typically bought for children to under 100 calories by the end of this year with Fudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp bars among those to have already made the switch.Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondelēz International, said: “We recognise we must play our part in tackling obesity and are committed to doing so without compromising on consumer choice. A focus on portion control is recognised as one of the most effective ways of helping people balance their calorie intake.”Measures to try and nudge the public into healthier food-buying habits are among policies being considered, in what has been billed a “war against obesity”, being drawn up by Downing Street.Last week it was suggested that supermarkets in England could be stopped from placing chocolate and sweets as impulse purchases at the end of aisles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957e657470f1edf6aadc0a37c13977a95d55a15c/68_110_5615_3369/master/5615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02810701b289b0bcdfa82c34c95b0687","title":"lloyds to increase number of black staff in senior roles","story":"High street lender will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report this yearThe commitment, announced to staff on Thursday, will mean recruiting about 168 more black colleagues into senior roles by 2024.Britain’s biggest high street lender will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report later this year and include at least one candidate from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background on every executive director shortlist.It will help ensure there is more erse pool of candidates to replace the outgoing chief executive, António Horta-Osório, who will step down next year after a decade at the helm.Currently, the bank only employs about 40 black staff across its 7,000-strong senior management team. The pledge will raise that total to about 210 staff and help reflect the proportion of black workers across the wider UK labour market.Horta-Osório said: “A more inclusive society is a more prosperous society, and a erse business is a better business.“It is clear that achieving an inclusive environment for everyone is our priority but right now we have very specific challenges that we have to address urgently for our black colleagues. Feedback has provided a clear way forward and, as a start, we have established an immediate action plan which focuses on culture, recruitment and progression.” As part of Lloyds’ seven-point action plan, it will develop an internal race education programme and organise regular “listening sessions” to gauge staff experiences.

We are beginning to see this recovery.”May’s GDP data, released earlier this week, did show that activity has picked up - but only slowly.So, when asked if he spies a V-shaped recovery (as chief economist Andy Haldane suggested recently), Bailey replied that “We don’t yet know the full story of this”.Bailey also pointed out that the recovery is uneven - car sales and housing transactions have picked up, but the entertainment and hospitality sector is still suffering.The euro is nudging higher in the foreign exchange markets, as traders look for any signs of progress in Brussels today.Despite a mood of caution, the single currency has gained half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.143. That put it close to Wednesday’s four-month high.Against the pound, it’s picked up half a penny to 91.1p.Traders may be anticipating that leaders make some progress today and tomorrow, even if a full-blown agreement to put the €750bn Recovery Fund into action will be a stretch.It could be case of deal, or no deal yet... Brad Bechtel of Jefferies suggests another summit will be needed:The mood is not too optimistic as there seems to be some significant hold outs still but if we were to get some form of agreement that would be quite positive and the worse case is a kick the can down the road meeting for later in the month or early August.Edward Moya of OANDA says Angela Merkel’s prediction of a ‘very tough’ meeting has cooled the markets.US equities fluctuated after German Chancellor Merkel’s cautious comments suggested EU leaders might not be able to reach a compromise at the EU summit. Her comments may have been posturing, but they did sink stocks to their session lows. Negotiations are expected to be tough from the frugal four, but optimism is high that a breakthrough will be made at the two-day summit.A diminutive spectre is stalking the UK’s shops -- the spectre of shrinkflation.Snack maker Mondelez is in the spotlight, after announcing that it is cutting the size of Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks to lower their calorie count.The move means Crunchie, Twirl and Wispa bars will contain no more than 200 calories each when sold in a four-pack, the BBC reports.Cutting the nation’s intake of sugary snacks shouldn’t be knocked... but Mondelez isn’t cutting its own intake of cash, as prices will stay the same. It’s part of a broader move in recent years -- I’m sure that Christmas sweetie tins were rather chunkier in my distant youth, for example.Mark Jones, food \u0026amp drink supply chain expert at law firm Gordons, reckons we’ll see more shrinkflation as the economy struggles.“This is a sign of the times. You may remember in July 2017, the ONS confirmed that 2,529 products shrank in size between January 2012 and June 2017 but their price remained the same. The vast majority of the affected products were food and drink.“Whilst that process has slowed in recent years, we can expect a new wave of shrinking products. The phenomenon was embraced by the market as a consequence of the last recession. No food producers wanted to increase the on-the-shelf price but, at the same time, they needed to cover the cost of rising overheads and limited volume growth in the packaged food market. The solution was to modestly reduce the size as consumers, generally, don’t notice.“Now we are on the brink of another recession, shrinkflation will probably increase again. Only this time, when the producers are caught, they are likely to point to the obesity epidemic as their motivation rather than their margins.”In China, investors are reeling from the worst week’s losses in four months.It was quite a week. Stocks hit a five-year high on Monday, then slid on Tuesday and Wednesday, before a hefty selloff on Thursday.Yesterday’s tumble came after Chinese retail sales shrank unexpectedly in June, while the wider economy returned to growth in Q2. That raised fears that consumption was weak.At the start of last week, State media were encouraging investors to take part in the “healthy bull market”. But the tone did change, urging traders to be cautious...Economists at ING have drawn up a handy graphic laying out the possible scenarios from the EU summit - and how it might move the markets.Their base case is that we see “some progress towards a compromise, but no final agreement” this weekend. That would give the euro a small nudge upwards, they reckon, while an actual deal would give it more strength.With handshakes out, EU leaders have been elbow-bumping:Our Jennifer Rankin is covering the Summit arrivals:French president Emmanuel Macron was hedging his bets too, telling reporters in Brussels that he was confident but cautious.“We will do everything we can to find an agreement”.An agreement on the EU Recovery Fund would be historic -- as it would mean European leaders crossing the Rubicon of shared debt liabilities, moving closer to full fiscal union.And that’s why reaching a full deal will be tough. Europe’s classic faultline - how much should the richer north help the poorer south - will be tested.Neil Wilson of Markets sums up the problem:We may get an agreement in principle on the fund that will be made up of a mix of grants and loans, with details on the total money value and attached reform requirements to be finessed. Even that might be a stretch though – Merkel warned this week that it could take until the end of the summer to achieve a deal and today said talks would be tough. Dutch PM Rutte said this morning he’s ‘not optimistic’ ahead of the talks. Indeed, I would not expect much more than a political declaration affirming member states commitment to achieving some kind of a deal. This not an ordinary summit – what’s being talked about is mutual debt issuance for the first time. A deal would be a major breakthrough for the EU and show that the bloc has the ability to respond to an era-defining crisis with one voice. Merkel is throwing all her political capital behind the European Recovery Fund, so there more than just EU solidarity riding on it. The Frugal Four of Sweden, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands remain the main barrier to achieving a deal as they are still to be convinced on why they should be sharing the burden of weaker states, but most countries will be out to fight their corner too. At least they are all back in a room and can talk through the night to trade horses and get something done – not so easy on Zoom, albeit it’s an absolute hangar of a room.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that negotiations will be ‘very tough’, which might dampen the mood in the markets.She told reporters in Brussels that:“We are all going into the talks with a lot of vigour but I must say that the differences are still very, very big and so I can’t yet say whether we will get a solution this time already.” “I expect very, very difficult negotiations.”EU leaders arriving for today’s Brussels summit have been diligently wearing their masks - although some then removed them to speak to the assembled press.Bettel has been urging his fellow leaders to show solidarity, warning a summit failure would be bad for Europe and the marketsThe decision to put the plane out to grass three years early highlights the slump in air travel demand under the pandemic.Demand for its Home Experts service, which matches local trades people with customers, has soared, it told shareholders.In Home Experts, consumer demand for home improvements has recovered strongly across all businesses. Call traffic is at record highs at eLocal, while Checkatrade had its largest ever number of consumer web visits in June at 2.76m (June 2019: 1.74m).That shows some caution about today’s summit, with Mohit Kumar of Jefferies predicting another meeting will be needed later this summer:We are optimistic that an agreement can be reached before end August but it would take an additional one or two meetings to reach a compromise on the three sticking points 1) grants vs loans 2) conditionality and 3) re-distribution of funds Italy’s economy minister has vowed to fight any efforts to water down the proposed €750bn recovery fund. Economy minister Roberto Gualtieri told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he wouldn’t accept a smaller package, or a cut to the balance between grants and loans.“It is crucial to close EU negotiations over the recovery fund as soon as possible, if possible already in this European council. “We will fight hard not to modify these elements.There are also some critical points in that proposal on which we will be very determined.”(thanks to Reuters for the quote). But the Frugal Four are also talking tough, with Dutch PM Mark Rutte insisting last week he’s ‘not made of marzipan’ (so won’t melt when the heat is on).The FT is also striking a cautious note, writing:Some warn that it will be a tall order for leaders to seal a deal this weekend, with some delegations preparing for a possible return to Brussels before the end of the month.“We are not there yet,” said an EU diplomat. “There are still bridges that need to be built”. Handshaking, back slapping and air kisses will all firmly discouraged at today’s EU summit, our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin reports:Any pre-summit bonhomie smoothing the way to a deal will be limited by social distancing. Leaders are being asked to wear masks on arrival and to avoid shaking hands – advice that appears to preclude the air kisses and backslapping that usually accompany the opening of summit talks.Gathering in the Europa headquarters of the European council, nicknamed the space egg, leaders will meet in a fifth-floor room designed to seat 330 people. This will ensure distancing for 30 leaders (27 national ones plus three from the EU institutions) and three or four senior EU officials.As well as a change to ventilation settings to eschew cheaper and more environmentally friendly recycled air, rooms will be cleaned during every break. Security, catering and cleaning staff and photographers will have to wear masks at all times.Special levers will be attached to toilet door handles to ease opening with an elbow. Each leader will get a sealed box of specially cleaned headphones to hear the interpreters. A doctor will be on site in case anyone starts to feel any coronavirus symptoms.She also predicts a tough meeting:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.No crisis is complete without a crunch European summit. And today, investors around the world are watching Brussels closely as EU leaders try to hammer out a €750bn recovery fund.The special two-day summit will see a classic clash between some of Europe’s ‘frugal’ Northern members, and the Southern states who have been hit harder by the pandemic (and were in weaker shape beforehand, following the eurozone debt crisis).The core of Brussels’ plan is a new ‘recovery and resilience facility’ of €560bn, to provide grants and loans to help countries recover from Covid-19.Crucially, Germany and France are both pushing for the EU to go to the markets to raise the money, backed by its common budget, and distributed towards regions and sectors that need it most after the pandemic. Italy, Spain and Greece could all head the queue for help.But Denmark, Sweden, Austria and The Netherlands have all pushed back -- they don’t fancy shared debt liability, and would favour a smaller package. They would also prefer the money to be doled out as loans, rather than grants.So, we can expect tough - but socially distanced - discussions among the bloc’s leaders, who will also try to agree a new seven-year budget (talks having collapsed back in February).Yesterday, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde tried to sound optimistic, telling reporters: “Our assumption... is that the recovery fund ... will come about and will be a strong mixture of grants on the one hand in larger proportion than loans on the other.”But the markets aren’t too hopeful of a breakthrough in the next couple of days.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has warned clients not to get their hopes up:Our view here at DB is that although an agreement is still possible this weekend, it would now be a positive surprise, and there’s no indication so far of the differences of opinion between the member states having been bridged yet.The meeting gets started at 10:00 Brussels time, though is scheduled to continue into Saturday, so it’s likely the final news of what’s happened will only be known over the weekend. We are optimistic that an agreement on the European Recovery Fund can be reached. However, recently Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said negotiations will be “very tough” and will likely need to continue throughout the summer. But time is clearly running short, with Europe facing its worst recession in decades. A Summit failure could rock the markets next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226c6f30548b190a9b13dfdf6558654d82bd8da5/0_73_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de21d806ffba9f7180b14bbaf0c6c45","title":"duda victory poland europe putin orban polish lgbt","story":"Like Putin and Orbán, the newly elected Polish president has successfully exploited the culture war about LGBT+ ‘ideology’Last Sunday, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, was re-elected by a narrow margin with the help of an assault on what he styled “LGBT ideology”: he campaigned on a “family charter” to protect Poles from this new threat, worse than communism.Two of Poland’s near neighbours have recently activated anti-LGBT politics in similar ways. In May, Viktor Orbán’s Hungarian government passed a law that makes it impossible for trans people to change their gender on legal documents. And last month, Russians voted by a landslide to approve Vladimir Putin’s Russian constitution: among its many amendments is one that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.Already, Russia’s lawmakers are explicitly using the new constitution to threaten freedoms associated with the liberal west: on Tuesday, Yelena Mizulina, the woman responsible for Russia’s anti-“gay propaganda” law, proposed legislation barring trans people from adopting children, or from establishing families – including getting married – after transitioning.For the first time since 1918, “God” is written into Russia’s constitution, which now also mandates the teaching of “patriotism”, and urges citizens to resist (western) falsification of their history. “We are not just going to vote on legal amendments,” Putin said. “We are voting for the country in which we want to live.”For which read: not Europe. Leaders like Putin, Orbán and Duda use LGBTQ+ people to draw what can be called a pink line against a western secular liberalism that allegedly threatens the “traditional values” of the homeland. This plays on deep-rooted anxieties about globalisation and the digital revolution, and the fear of a loss of control that comes with the opening of borders to new ideas and new people – or, in the case of LGBTQ+ people, those who have been there all along, but now demand to be seen.This culture wars tactic has undergone a significant shift in recent years: whereas it used to oppose “lifestyles” or “rights”, it is now sets itself against “ideology” this allows it to assume the status of a counter-hegemonic force – and also to claim, as more people come out of the closet, that it is “not personal”. “LGBT are not people, but ideology,” said Duda when he launched his charter.In recent years conservative Christians have gravitated towards opposing “gender ideology”, of which “LGBT ideology” is a subset. The archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jędraszewski, encapsulated the argument last year: while Poland was “no longer affected by the red plague,” he said, there was a “new one that wants to control our souls, hearts and minds … not Marxist, Bolshevik, but born of the same spirit, neo-Marxist. Not red, but rainbow.”This call has particular power for east Europeans, given Soviet history, and so is useful to politicians like Duda or Orbán. But it has been deployed the world over, from Latin America to Asia.In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro attained his popularity in part by piggy-backing on to a powerful grassroots religious movement determined to expel “gender ideology” from schools by banning sexuality education. He promised to restore the natural order to a corrupt and decadent country exemplified by the way his leftwing predecessors granted rights to LGBTQ+ people.And in the United States, Donald Trump’s government has played to its conservative base by withdrawing regulatory protections for trans children in schools, and banning trans people from military service. Last month, it ruled that they are not protected from discrimination in healthcare – even as the supreme court outlawed such discrimination in the workplace.For populist politicians like Trump or Bolsonaro, this plays to a particular constituency: disaffected voters who perceive they have been marginalised due to identity politics gone mad, and that their needs have been subordinated to the interests of outsiders, foreign or dark or queer.But despite Duda’s victory, the Polish election results could be read another way. Before the election was initially postponed in May, because of coronavirus, Duda was the runaway favourite, not least because of his government’s social welfare policies. And yet, last weekend, he won with a tiny margin in the runoff against moderate liberal Rafał Trzaskowski.• Mark Gevisser is the author of The Pink Line: The World’s Queer Frontiers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c3f829dbd97e878dbbbda372379fd3517cd8b7b/0_599_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c535bbad8eac044eac6cf29d03029cf0","title":"summer covid 19 holiday new york","story":"Covid-19 has made us rethink what is and isn’t essential. Right now, an August holiday away from New York is high on the listThis week, New York City recorded no coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since the outbreak arrived in the city. Yet elsewhere, daily deaths hit new highs in Florida, parts of California went back under lockdown, and schools in LA and San Diego announced they won’t be opening for the start of the school year in August.To be in a former hotspot where the virus is, for now, under control, is to occupy a strange twilight world. Looking at the rest of the US, the assumption in New York is that things will definitely get worse. Now – for a hot second – is the time to break cover.It has been strange, glancing at the UK, to see the focus of reopening fall on garden centres and pubs. The preoccupations are different, over here. New York is a neurotic town and for those lucky enough to have adequate insurance, the reflex response to phase three reopening has been a rush towards healthcare practitioners. After months of missed screenings, wellness checks, and that peculiarly American obsession, orthodontics, the imperative in the last 10 days among certain stripes of New Yorker has been to jam in as many visits to doctors as can be realistically managed. This week, I booked in for overdue mammograms, dermatologist screenings, ob-gyn check-ups, as well as my kids’ routine medicals and all the dentistry we can lay our hands on.It’s a psychological as much as a physical reflex. One effect of the pandemic has been to change how we process the passage of time, so that for months now, many of us have been forced to inhabit the unbearable yoga-inspired maxim of living entirely in the present. All future plans cancelled, or at least suspended until further notice no knowledge of how things will turn out, how deep the economic impact will go, or when we’ll be able to fly to see our loved ones again. If making plans is a way to convince ourselves we have more control than we do, that illusion has been truly shattered.The great ide of the pandemic, of course, is between those for whom the impact of this – be it in lost income or lives – has been immediate, and those for whom the slow motion domino effect of the tanking economy will be felt further down the line. For some, to be relieved of the ability to make plans for the future has been an experiment in living that has, to date, had occasional upsides: less pressure to do anything, including shower and get dressed a break from frog-marching the kids to their endless extracurricular activities. A chance, for a second, to exhale.Those days of relief are almost certainly numbered and it raises a question. For anyone with even small amounts of disposable income, what is the sensible course of action this summer? Is it wanton, now, to spend any money at all, given the certainty that more bad times are coming? Or, given that certainty, is now the time to have a last hurrah and sneak in a few weeks of vacation in August – if you can drive far enough out of New York to escape the price-gouging of local holiday rentals – so that, if lockdown reoccurs, you are not still burnt-out and shouting?This is a luxurious dilemma for sure. But for those with wriggle room, it does force a reassessment around what in our lives qualifies as “essential”. So many things we considered non-negotiable have fallen by the wayside in the last four months that our old lives look bloated and absurd. This goes all the way down to latterly unthinkable things, like full-time education. Overlooking the dire impact on childcare, when a friend with three kids said to me this week, “I have a theory that you can miss a whole year of school and nothing happens”, I found myself inclined to agree. There will come a point, however, when this rationalisation exhausts itself and we will have to figure out what we can and can’t do without.Perhaps I’m being too apocalyptic. Perhaps we’ll have a new president in November, there will be a vaccine in January, and much of this will be moot. But it doesn’t feel that way now, and I keep thinking of the biblical line popularised by Jeanette Winterson: “The summer is ended and we are not yet saved”. In which case, for those still able to, perhaps it is prudent to invest in small joys while we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e56828889225c45aba281d1dd30b8a746ea2e54/0_312_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94ec548f20e3b41083c91f037ec74e9e","title":"ziwe comedy instagram live","story":"If you’re cringing, that’s the point.

But her guests recently have also included Jeremy O Harris, who wrote Slave Play, and the comedian Dana Donnelly.The live, interactive nature of the show allows viewers to chip in, so as guests fumble over questions such as “Qualitatively, what do you like about Black people?” viewers can – and do – roast them in the comments section.Roman apparently likes the way Black people dance and cook – but we’ll never know more because Ziwe stopped Roman short, simply saying: “I’m doing you a favor”. These moments – when Ziwe steps in to save her guests – are a brief reprieve for those who find the show lacking in generosity.But her questioning does, at times, feel torturous. Asking Roman (who faced a backlash after she called Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo – two Asian women – sellouts) to name five Asian people was never going to go well, and even if Roman could name 10, it wouldn’t be particularly illuminating. So what, exactly, is Ziwe trying to achieve with this exercise?Ziwe says she does not want her guests to fail, but she does believe in asking hard questions. “What comes out in my interview tactics is I’m actually trying to be nice, to be kind, to educate, not shame, necessarily,” she says. “Sure, I do it in a way that is really confrontational, but my goal is to help and heal people. I get comments like ‘Ziwe, you hate white people and you’re the devil.’ I don’t think those people necessarily understand the concept of my show or have watched a longer clip,” she tells me on an early morning phone call from her Brooklyn apartment.There are moments when her frank questioning captures something that sensitive questioning cannot. After Caroline Calloway proudly exclaims that she is fed up with white people pretending they’re not racist, Ziwe’s sharp reply – “Oh, so you’re a proud racist?” – reminds us that bragging about doing the bare minimum shouldn’t be commended.After Roman’s numerous defenses for her recipe for a bastardized curry (ingredients: chickpeas, coconut milk, turmeric) which she calls a “stew” – ignoring the recipe’s roots – it was refreshing to hear Ziwe ask: “Would you consider yourself the Christopher Columbus of food influencing?” “No, I wouldn’t,” said an irked Roman, who went on to define a curry as complex, while “a stew is a generic blanket term for like a thick soupy liquid dinner”.Lest you think she is too harsh on her guests, there’s a method to this exchange, Ziwe argues. “Calling someone a proud racist, it’s radical – it seems very cruel and intense and violent but I am actually making the statement that like, ‘Hey, we need to name this thing that is sort of plaguing our nation or else we are doomed.”Some argue that making people feel embarrassed is not a good way to tackle racism, but that often overlooks the other person in the debate: the person who is afflicted by a racist, sexist or homophobic comment, but has to prioritize the feelings of the offender above their own.In other words: why are we more worried about being called a racist than being racist?Considering she is a comedian, not an activist, to burden Ziwe with the far from enviable task of curing racist America with her show could be considered presumptuous. Why should her job be to change minds, rather than make people laugh? But she tells me it is supposed to be political during our interview, so I send her a text after our call and ask her whether the accusation is ever leveled at her:“Ziwe, I’m wondering, do you ever get people saying things to you like: ‘If you really want to change minds this is not the way to go about it. You’re putting people off you’re probably only talking to people who agree with you.”“Nothing that literally, but here is a tweet I got tagged in,” she replies, sending me a screen-grab of a tweet, in which someone says: “I struggle to see how things like Ziwe’s ‘gotcha’ tactics are helping anything at all.”“How did that make you feel? Do you buy it?” I ask.“I disagree, but I encourage those who don’t approve of my tactics to join me in finding positive ways to effect change. I’m just doing my best like everyone else,” she says.Ziwe argues there are no wrong or right answers on her show, just honest ones. “The questions are designed to be impossible because ultimately the way that we are dealing with race is impossible. To pretend that you don’t have a racist bone in your body, that’s a fallacy, that is not based in reality,” she says as she suppresses an exasperated laugh. “It’s not an impossible question if you just say what you think,” she says.There are, obviously, incorrect answers. The internet has a furious appetite for wrongdoing: people are swallowed whole for making mistakes, and people often love to pile on, to admonish the wrongdoer. When this happens, there is no compassion, no context, just right and wrong – only, right and wrong constantly changes, and people’s moral compasses expand, shift and change overtime. At least her guests are showing they want to learn. But Ziwe doesn’t really believe in cancel culture. “People who get ‘cancelled’ never really get cancelled, right? They get a lot of press and they are trending on Twitter but I don’t know if we see legitimate repercussions in their lives,” she says. “I think if you say racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist stuff then yeah, people are gonna be mad at you, and you shouldn’t be surprised or go home like a boo-hoo baby and cry. You deserve everything that comes to you, right?”This is a confusing set of statements, and relate to the main criticism that can be made of the show. If cancel culture is not real – with its victims suffering no concrete consequences outside of having their profiles elevated as the internet obsesses over them for weeks – it would be fair to ask whether Ziwe’s show feeds that publicity machine. Some will say there are impacts (Roman’s New York Times column was suspended after her comments about Teigen and Kondo).Still, to describe the show as simple “gotcha” comedy or a show based on the celebrity status of the formerly “cancelled” misses the mark. Ziwe’s former show, Baited, also used reductive questioning to remind us of our racial biases. In it, Ziwe deliberately race-baits her guests as a device to make people think about the way that we discuss race.In one episode, the tables are turned: Ziwe is interviewed by the completely un-baitable comedian Aparna Nancherla, who tries to get Ziwe to do something racist. They play a game where Ziwe has to help Nancherla guess the name of a celebrity – normally an ethnic minority with an accent. Ziwe seems uncomfortable, but she won’t bite. “I want the audience to see these excruciating, hard questions and say, ‘Hey, how would I answer that question?’ I want to point out my guests’ racial biases, the audience’s racial biases and my own racial biases. I am constantly trying to critique culture. So if you’re asking me who am I laughing at? Everyone! Including myself, always!”It might be cringe-making to watch, but Ziwe warns that she doesn’t want you to just feel angry at Caroline Calloway when you watch her interview – she wants you to think about how Calloway is a product of the world we live in.She wants people to come away from the show equipped to have these conversations – something she could not do when she was younger.“I remember going to prep school, going to university, and I didn’t have the vocabulary where I could have these really tough conversations to really confront racism. I didn’t have the vocabulary to defend myself,” she says.For her, the show is not just radical, it’s a kind of therapy: “I am trying to think about my younger self. How would I want to defend that version of myself? I hope I am doing that for my audience too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7025e0b6f1d41f6c974d86d79a7be65b87187d1b/0_140_5709_3424/master/5709.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f82b852b84cad4e74b1b06f37f0da5f6","title":"bearded vulture makes rare uk visit in peak district national park","story":"Species is one of Europe’s largest and rarest raptors, last seen in England in 2016Birdwatchers have been flocking to the boggy and desolate moors of the Peak District to try to spot a bearded vulture, one of the rarest birds ever seen in the UK, which has set up home on a remote cliff in the national park.This is only the second sighting of a bearded vulture in the UK, one of the largest and rarest raptors in Europe, and which was last seen in England in 2016.The bird is thought to be a juvenile with a wing of almost 3 metres and was first reported in the UK in late June, having being tracked from Belgium before arriving in the Peak District about two weeks ago.Birdwatcher Fred Fearn tweeted a video of the vulture, which is also known as a lammergeier, eating bones on a rock.The vulture is a wild-hatched bird that originates from either the Alps or the Pyrenees, according to José Tavares, the director of the Vulture Conservation Foundation, which runs a bearded vulture reintroduction scheme across Europe.“It is common for young bearded vultures to leave the mountains and explore vast areas, but it is unusual for this species to cross over large bodies of water, which in this case was the English Channel,” Tavares said.“The bird will most likely attempt to return home in the future, but it is difficult to predict when or which route it will take.”Like all vultures, bearded vultures are scavengers but are unique in that they are the only bird to live on a diet made up almost exclusively of bones, meaning they pose no threat to farm animals or game birds. In the Peak District, the vulture has been seen feeding on the bones of a dead sheep.Birdwatchers planning on seeing the bird this weekend are being asked to ensure its safety.“We’re really excited that a rare bearded vulture has chosen to roost on National Trust land in the Peak District,” said Rachel Bennett, a National Trust ranger.“However, it’s vital that we all do everything we can not to disturb the bird while it is here. We want to make sure it’s protected and safe, as well as looking after the surrounding wildlife and other visitors, as well as our local community.”While the vulture is protected under EU law, there are fears for its future.“There are obvious concerns for the bird’s safety as it’s currently within the worst 10km square for raptor persecution in England, dominated by land used for driven grouse shooting,” said Mark Thomas, the head of investigations at the RSPB.“It’s great that the bird is effectively being protected by the admiring public and birdwatchers.”Tim Birch, from Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, believes the vulture’s presence in the uplands of the Peak District gives us a glimpse of what a wilder future could look like.He said: “Much of our charismatic wildlife remains missing from the Peak District national park including pine martens and hen harriers along with healthy populations of peregrines and goshawks. We will all benefit along with wildlife when our national parks and the environment becomes wilder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884c16c3490b5b97485a30323814eb4a6313d950/0_160_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9394a121f22805365eb4ba012e1407da","title":"share your photos from the big butterfly count 2020","story":"As the world’s biggest butterfly count gets underway once again, we’d like to see photos of what you’ve seenToday sees the start of the UK’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, which asks people to spend 15 minutes in an outdoor space and count the amount and type of butterflies, and some day-flying moths, they see.We’d like to hear about the butterflies that you spot too – and we’d also like to see photographs, if you’re lucky enough to capture them.

For years, my favourite throw-over summer layer was a navy crewneck cardigan, which I found in the now discontinued Classics section at Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Chunkily woven and completely plain, except for gold buttons, it falls heavy and straight to the hip bone – a bit like a Chanel jacket, but for £30 – and I still love it.But a new cardigan era dawned late last year, when Katie Holmes wore an oatmeal cashmere one that was brief enough to reveal, when she raised an arm to hail a taxi, both an inch of tanned tummy and a flash of the matching bra underneath. A new twinset – the bradigan – was born.The bradigan itself was completely daft, but it did wonders for the cardigan brand. The cardigan has always been too sensible, too wallflower, too downbeat. The bradigan showed that a cardigan could shake its hair loose and take its specs off, sort of thing – and lo, the party cardi was born.• Cardigan, jeans and shoes, all Jess’s own.

Now, the Clockwork Orange star is reconciled to a life of golf, gangster flicks and the odd glimpse of geniusMalcolm McDowell was the insolent prince of early-70s cinema, the Liverpool salesman who stormed the establishment’s barricades. You can see him on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s If…., kickstarting a bloody revolution inside an English public school. You can see him in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, hanging with his droogs at the Korova milk-bar, making up his rassoodock what to do with the night. The sky was the limit. The world was his oyster. One felt he could achieve pretty much anything.If McDowell’s life was a movie, he would either have gone on to be crowned king or he would have exploded and vanished, ideally before he turned 30. But real life has a way of monkeying with the script, which may explain why McDowell is now a snowy-haired 77-year-old. He is a father of five, an avid golfer and a jobbing Hollywood actor specialising in baddies. His wild youth is behind him. He has made peace with his lot. “I had an incredible first few years,” he explains. “And of course that was the golden age. But you can’t keep playing the rebel for ever.”Every now and then he’ll land a peach of a part. Last year he played Rupert Murdoch in the #MeToo drama Bombshell. But his filmography also includes titles such as Abnormal Attraction and Death Race 2050, Kids vs Monsters and Meet the Small Potatoes. He has appeared in nearly 300 productions, many of which he forgot the instant he walked off the set. “People stop me and say: ‘Oh, we loved you in blah-blah’ and I say: ‘Sorry, that wasn’t me.’ And then they’ll show me on their phone or show me the DVD cover and sure enough, there I am.” He chuckles. “And I have no memory of doing it at all.”In his latest film, The Big Ugly, he plays a London gangster at large in the US, intent on laundering dirty money through the green hills of Appalachia. Billed below Vinnie Jones and above Ron Perlman, McDowell comes weaving through the action with a weaselly menace and a face like a clenched fist. It’s the sort of polished, dependable B-movie performance that must feel almost second nature by now.Happily, McDowell remembers The Big Ugly. They shot the film in Kentucky, deep in the boondocks at the height of summer. He recalls boarding at the Motel 6 and eating biscuits and grits at the local Cracker Barrel. “I had my 14-year-old son staying with me. He got so bored and it got so hot. That steamy southern heat that Tennessee Williams writes about. The only thing to do was drive to Walmart and walk around this big air-conditioned building to keep cool. That was the excitement. That was the big thing to look forward to. Breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then we’ll hit Walmart. After a week, he said: ‘You know what, Dad? I think I’d like to go home and see Mum.’”Just lately, of course, McDowell has been at home a lot, too. He lives with his third wife, Kelley, in a small town near LA but says the effects of the pandemic have largely passed him by. The main drag is that he was booked in to have his left knee replaced but the operation kept being cancelled it’s finally happening tomorrow. “I’ve been winging it for long enough,” he says. “Hobbling about, bone-on-bone.”He was a child of the aspirational postwar working-class. His dad ran a pub in Burscough in West Lancashire, the Bull and Dog. In his youth, McDowell worked at the Planters’ nut factory and as a coffee sales rep before alighting in London. He had a confident swagger and an air of dancing mischief. He went about life as though it were a game to be played, or a set of rules to be broken. “You’re a Brechtian actor,” Lindsay Anderson told him. “They know that you’re acting but the audience believes you anyway.”The collaboration with Anderson was like a marriage, he says. Spats, rows and make-ups. They made three fine films together, chasing the character of If….’s Mick Travis through the capitalist hunting grounds of O Lucky Man to the floundering society of Britannia Hospital. And it was thanks to If.… that he landed the role of Alex DeLarge in the vicious, playful A Clockwork Orange, prancing about Thamesmead in bovver boots and a bowler hat. “Fiftieth anniversary next year,” he says. “Where does the time go?”At the peak of his fame he starred in Caligula, a fevered Roman epic bankrolled by Penthouse magazine. The production sounds hilarious it was basically two films in one. First, McDowell played the mad emperor alongside a classy lineup of actors that included Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O’Toole. Then the producers brought in adult performers to shoot hardcore sex scenes to be deployed as extended cutaways, seemingly at random, so as to give the impression that McDowell was gazing wistfully at a lesbian orgy, or a gladiator getting a blowjob. “There’s quite a good movie in there somewhere,” he says. “But not the porn stuff.”McDowell’s imitation of Gielgud is perfect. He catches the man’s mellifluous delivery and querulous top note. “He’d say: ‘Oh, my accountant says I have to make cutbacks but I don’t see where I can.’ And I’d say, “Well, you’ve got a huge house, John.’ He’d say: ‘Oh yes, but I can’t sell that.’ ‘Well OK, but don’t you have a chauffeur-driven Rolls?’ ‘But, but – how do you think I’m going to get into London?’ ‘How about the train?’ ‘Oh, but I couldn’t do that. The train indeed!’ And I’d say” “Well, that’s why you’re having to do movies like this one, John.’”At the end of the decade, McDowell went to Hollywood to play the role of HG Wells in the film Time After Time. There he met the American actor Mary Steenburgen. The marriage eventually ended but by then he had put down roots. Looking back, he seems more nostalgic for his old London house than for the British film career he abandoned. “It was just off Church Street, near Notting Hill Gate, back of the Czech embassy. Painter’s studio. A unique building. I bought it in 1969 and sold it the first year that Blair got in. And my Aunt Vera lived there for longer than I did. I said: ‘You can stay here, Auntie, I’ll be back in three months.’ Then I went to Hollywood, met Mary, fell in love, had two children. Never went back.”England at the time felt too small, too parochial. Whereas the US was enormous, almost too big to handle. “I was out of my depth,” he admits. “So I played the heavy. The Brit. Which is sort of boring, but unfortunately that’s the way things worked out. When you move to a country like America, you’re a very small fish in a very big pond.”I’m interested to hear McDowell’s side of the story. Reading the cuttings, one gets a different take: the sense of an actor who somehow squandered his promise and let his audience down, possibly out of spite. The critic David Thomson refers to his “strange, thwarted career”. The biographer Roger Lewis describes his later years with an undisguised glee (“his pretty boy looks faded and he was condemned to playing villains in straight-to-video films that turn up on Channel 5”). It’s as though McDowell’s progress offends our collective sensibility. We hate to think of Peter Pan growing up to become a footsoldier in Neverland. The children of the revolution must never ever play golf.I ask whether he is as excited by acting as he was in his youth and he says that he is by and large, it depends on the part. “I still love it, otherwise I wouldn’t do it. Maybe in my forties I didn’t have a good time. People didn’t know what to do with me. I was a useful rebel in the 60s and 70s. But the Kubrick movie was overbearing. Everything was measured against A Clockwork Orange, which gets a little old. But that’s what happens when you work with giants.”Kubrick, in the end, was too controlling, “too brutal”, to properly bond with. But he adored Anderson and was great friends with Robert Altman. Those were his giants. Maybe there are others still out there. From time to time he will overhear his sons discussing new directors they love artists who seem to share the same bold and freewheeling style. “But I’m an old fossil these days. So I sit still and stay quiet.”Far be it for me to moonlight as his manager, but if he hears that there are exciting young film-makers hiding in the woods, why not seek them out? Better that, surely, than another third-billed slot as a photo-fit Mr Knuckles, another film he has forgotten as soon as it is put in the can.“No,” McDowell says, “I’m not going to seek them out. If they offer me something, I’ll do it. But do I want to go parading around actively looking for work? No. Because I don’t have the ambition to be above the title, doing this, that and the other. I really don’t care. I’ve had an amazing run, an incredible career, when you take it all into account.”Maybe this is the arc of most actors’ careers. Maybe it’s not just actors either. We start out looking for the biggest stage, the biggest challenge, the project with the potential to turn the world on its head. We finish up with a different set of requirements: a regular pay-cheque, some half-decent colleagues and a work trip somewhere warm, preferably near a golf course. McDowell – gifted, vibrant actor though he is – once said he would rather hit a home run than win an Academy Award. He tells me that this was partly meant as a joke but that actually he did hit a home run one time and it’s the most exhilarating thing, a feeling that lasts for ever.On top of that, he has never especially been a believer in prizes. It has always struck him as funny, the way the Academy lavishes acting Oscars on the movies with the best script and the best direction, the ones that are already so good that the actor barely makes any difference. The voters, he feels, are coming at it arse-backwards. Those aren’t the films where the real heavy lifting takes place.McDowell casts his mind back over his own long list of credits. The gangster flicks and the sci-fi knock-offs. The kids’ animations that few kids ever saw. He says: “I sometimes think: ‘My God, I’ve just acted in a real piece of shit and I managed to produce a credible performance. I managed to turn that piece of shit into something watchable.’ That’s what’s worthy of an acting award.”The Big Ugly is out on 24 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b559e38c6c6bc6142e72788af9e88652aa6d08/0_0_4239_2543/master/4239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4308c190883ff7b7bd1e6908a774c5b","title":"borussia dortmund agree deal to buy jude bellingham from birmingham","story":"Borussia Dortmund have agreed to buy Jude Bellingham from Birmingham City for a fee that could rise to €25m (£22.75m).The 17-year-old midfielder, who is in line for a five-year contract, would follow Jadon Sancho as a young English player to join the Bundesliga club.Bellingham made his Birmingham debut at the start of this season aged 16 years and 38 days and became the club’s youngest goalscorer at 16 days and 63 days, eclipsing Trevor Francis’s records.

Wearing hi-vis shirts, wellies and waders, they were the only ones who got close. Cars passed by beeping but on the street there were more police than people. Usually the scene of celebration, thousands gathering, this time fans had been asked to stay away and the men who had won the league weren’t coming either.They were 15km north-east. “We would have liked be there at Cibeles with the fans, but there will be time for that and they’ll be happy watching at home,” Zinedine Zidane said. Around him, the floor was soon covered in confetti and his players wore commemorative T-shirts. We Are The Champions boomed around and a celebratory banquet was prepared, burger and chips the dinner of champions. But this was their training ground, not the Santiago Bernabéu, and when Sergio Ramos lifted the trophy only a couple of hundred people were there to see it: staff, ballboys, six reporters and Villarreal standing politely to applaud. It was, the manager said: “Strange for everyone.” It had been that kind of season.Yet if there had been no wild celebration, no open-topped bus on the day that Spain paid tribute to almost 30,000 victims of coronavirus and figures brought fears of a more outbreaks and renewed restrictions, there was nothing empty in the embraces. Madrid’s manager felt fulfilled, more than ever before. “I don’t have the words I feel huge emotion,” he said. He also described it as one of the most significant days of his life. For the man who has won a trophy every 19 games, the day he won La Liga stood above all those European Cups, not last because of how far they had come. The longest season had ended with Madrid’s third league in 12 years, just as he had hoped it would.“Our season will be good, I’m convinced,” Zidane had said almost exactly a year ago. Which might sound standard enough, the usual pre-season optimism soon bitten by reality, but that was in New York where his side had just let in seven against Atlético Madrid. “One great team and one set of ruins,” judged one front cover there was “no football, no fight, no plan.” Only there was, and from the rubble came the champions, the hint of a new culture emerging at a club where Europe had eclipsed all else. “Zidane built the plan the league was our objective from the start,” said Thibaut Courtois on Thursday night.It wasn’t smooth and it wasn’t always sparkling, but slowly something was building even if it wasn’t with the tools Zidane had in mind. Paul Pogba hadn’t arrived, while James Rodríguez and Gareth Bale hadn’t gone, their moves blocked after the defeat to Atlético. They were destined to play minor roles – unlike the men in whom Zidane trusted when others didn’t, club included. This is not a new side, at least not when it comes to the names. Eight players have started more than 20 league games and all of them were there already. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are 34, Marcelo and Karim Benzema 32, Kroos 30. Between them, they have 54 seasons at the club some didn’t want them to have any more. If earlier in the season it so often felt like Madrid relied on the dynamic presence of Fede Valverde, and while Vinicius was decisive in the clásico, ultimately this feels like the success of the old guard, trusted and revived by Zidane.Built around a spine of seven+two that have almost always played – Courtois, Carvajal, Ramos, Raphaël Varane, MendyMarcelo, Casemiro, Kroos, ModricValverde and Benzema – Madrid have won a league in which they’ve had minimal contributions from their new arrivals (Mendy apart) and even less from their four most expensive players, including their two most costly signings ever and four of the all-time top six. Bale, Hazard, Jovic and Rodríguez cost €336m for an average of 8.75 games and 1.5 goals. With Hazard struggling with injuries, Benzema has led, scoring 21 league goals that’s more than all the other forwards put together. The second top scorer is Ramos, on 10.And yet at every step, there have been key contributions at key moments. Twenty-one different men have scored: of the outfield players, only Éder Militão and Brahim Díaz (39 minutes) have not. They went top at Valladolid in January, Nacho Fernández heading in the only goal and Zidane talking about the significance of set plays. The week before Casemiro scored both against Sevilla. At Getafe, Varane scored two from set plays. At Alavés, Dani Carvajal and Ramos scored. All that in a seven-week run than included 0-0 draws at Athletic and Barcelona and a 95th-minute equaliser at Valencia, scored when Courtois went up for a corner.There were glimpses of something more expansive – Eibar, Leganés – but that idea was taking shape. There was variety in their formations – 4-3-3, 4-5-1 4-4-2 – they pressed higher than before and the ball was brought out cleaner now, while there was also a tighter structure than in Zidane’s first spell. Solidity and seriousness were the foundation stone, an idea more pronounced after the pandemic but there from the start. When Madrid dropped points in week two, giving the ball away, Zidane complained that they should have just booted the bloody thing. In week five he did something even he hadn’t done before: took a Madrid team to the Sanchez Pizjuán and won 1-0, the word solidarity a recurring theme afterwards. Two weeks after, they drew the derby 0-0, Courtois responding to suggestions of conservatism by saying: “We weren’t going to go mad.” “Solidity is very important it’s what gives you life,” Zidane added. “If we’re defensively strong, OK. We’ll do something in attack.”Not that it was perfect. Beaten by Mallorca in the autumn, there were doubts. And had they lost in Istanbul in October, Zidane might not have survived. They came through those and went top when they defeated Barcelona in March, but that was their only win in four league games. Out of the Copa del Rey, they lost to Manchester City in Europe too. The week after the clásico, they lost at Betis and Barcelona were leaders again, the situation delicate. And then everything stopped.When it restarted, it was something else. Not so much two halves as two different things clumsily welded together, like From Dusk Til Dawn. Barcelona had never really convinced even when they led, the team desperately trying to keep the club’s crisis at bay, and now they started to collapse, dropping eight of the last 30 points on course to finish with their fewest points in over a decade. Meanwhile, Madrid got stronger, the new context suiting them. If Zidane had changed Madrid’s culture, it is also true that something shifted when the league became more like the Champions League, the target within touching distance, a sole focus. Five weeks to get through and nothing else, 11 games to glory. Or 10, as it turned out.“Lockdown was good for us, to react and take the return super seriously: there was no margin for error in our minds,” Ramos admitted. “What makes now different is that after lockdown when they came back they wanted to do great things you could see it in the training sessions they wanted to do more, and that tells you everything,” Zidane revealed. Everything else stripped away – the noise, the tension, the intangibles, all those elements that bring equality – they were too strong. “When their fifth sub is Kroos …” Athletic manager Gaizka Garitano said. The former Madrid manager Bernd Schuster even suggested that it might even have been good for them to play behind closed doors, away from the pressure of the Bernabéu, where those tight games are a problem, not a pathway. One that led inevitably to the title, with 10 wins from 10, just four goals let in.Since the restart Madrid have never been behind, let alone beaten. They started two points behind and finished seven points in front it wasn’t always brilliant – although the second half against Valencia and the first in Granada were superb – but it brokered little argument. They didn’t even need all their games. Zidane insisted that the title race would run until the last day but for once he was wrong. Victory against Villarreal meant that Madrid won the league with a game to spare.After everything that happened, everything he believes in, all the doubts that he knows are there – even from within own club, even from within his own mind – this was the competition Zidane wanted most of all. No one had appreciated Barcelona’s titles like him, which is why no one appreciated this quite like him. The league was the true test, he kept insisting, the proof that you’re the best, reason enough to visit Cibeles, even if that has to be some other day. “The Champions League is the Champions League,” Zidane said late on Thursday, “but, the Spanish league, pfff … the Spanish league is the dog’s bollocks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b230465560135235b7af182f7a00a525bd75a916/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150e829355fb869e908e9bcfa3f4ea4b","title":"fix of the trade how google helped a handyman build his business online","story":"Wielding the right digital tools has enabled Will Lingard to thrive, even during lockdownAs with most self-employed tradespeople, word of mouth plays a significant role in Will Lingard’s job as a handyman in and around Wonersh, a pretty village of red-tile cottages and timber-beamed houses a few miles south of Guildford. Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd5768d253d9a63e17d7252950e98744d03d90f/0_289_4980_2989/master/4980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=148c861222ddee009795270c789e25ac","title":"childrens sleep severely affected coronavirus experts anxiety routine","story":"Warning as anxiety and lack of routine lead to rise in inquiries at clinics The coronavirus crisis is having a significant impact on children’s sleep, with anxiety and lack of routine causing serious disruption, experts and charities have warned.“At the moment we are very busy,” the clinic’s founder Mandy Gurney said. “We have definitely seen a spike in six- to eight-year-old children with anxiety impacting their sleep. And for younger ones who are not seeing other babies in parenting groups – I think it will be hard when they start to go out more”.She added: “Parents are also finding it hard to keep older children’s or teenagers sleep’ on track, as the temptation to lie in is very strong when there is no school to get up for.”A survey of 2,700 people in April gave the early warning sign about the long-term negative impact coronavirus is having on children’s sleep.It supports a newly published paper from the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry that suggests the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high.In Lincolnshire, a sleep service started by the Sleep Charity saw 90 people in March 2020, with 169 on the waiting list.“We are definitely very busy and seeing an awful lot of children with a late sleep phase, so they are finding it hard to go to sleep at a normal time and not falling asleep until late,” said Lisa Artis, the deputy chief executive of the Sleep Charity. “It’s triggered by not having regulated routine but also anxiety.” She added that parents were finding it hard too, because they have little respite and children are not able to exercise as they normally would. “We have had some sad cases where families found themselves separating because of the pressure, so deciding to live separately for a period of time because of the general pressure with sleep being part of it.”In May, researchers from King’s College London conducted a survey of 2,254 people to ascertain how the virus outbreak and lockdown has impacted their sleep. Almost half of 16- to 24-year-olds said they were sleeping fewer hours than they had been prior to lockdown. In comparison, a third of those aged 35 and older said the same.“Coronavirus has had a significant impact on sleep,” said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at Evelina London at Guys and St Thomas’ NHS trust. “Teenagers are often trying to be forced into a sleep pattern that is not natural for their biological pattern. They may want to get up later and society and school forces them into a pattern of getting up earlier but lockdown lets that sleep pattern drift.”The Evelina London hospital has released some tips on sleep, advising exercise during the day and getting outside. They also said to make sure curtains are closed and lights dim at night, as well as introducing a calming bedtime routine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c194c9bc9b55c02241aad687637e6c0754f9be53/956_956_3195_1917/master/3195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51254e8481abe96e076cf45fba001e6","title":"experience im an irish dancing tiktok star","story":"Beyoncé’s mum reposted my video, and Leo Varadkar invited me to Ireland for St Patrick’s DayI created my TikTok account shortly before the pandemic. I first heard about it from some of the younger kids at my dance school. They were doing all these viral dances with choppy choreography, so I gave it a go. I was terrible! I tried to learn the routine to Savage, a song by Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé, but I couldn’t move fluidly. So I tried Irish dancing to it, instead, doing the tricky footwork like rocks and toe-stands, trebles, drums.To my surprise, hip-hop works well with Irish dance choreography: you can tap out the beats with your shoes. I posted a video in the evening at about 3am, I woke up and there were thousands of comments in everything from Russian to Chinese, and so many from people in Ireland. When the Irish author Emma Dabiri posted it on Twitter, even more flocked to my page.I started getting Facebook friend requests from older Irish people saying how much joy it gives them to see me dance, and that my mum must be so proud – it’s very cute. The video has had more than 1m views even Beyoncé’s mum reposted it. In the space of a few days, I had been tweeted by the then taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He wrote: “Some brilliant moves there, we’d love to have you over,” and invited me to Ireland to dance on St Patrick’s Day.I did an interview on Irish radio where they surprised me by having the director of Riverdance, Padraic Moyles, on the phone. He told me what I was doing was unique and asked me to take part in the touring show. I would definitely have gone to see it when it came to Virginia now I’m going to be in it.Since then, I’ve posted other TikToks of me dancing to tracks by Drake, Koffee, Doja Cat, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson. The comments have been mostly celebratory, but some people said that, as a black woman, I’m appropriating Irish culture. I’m passionate about Irish dance, teaching and my identity as a young woman of colour, so the comments about “cultural appropriation” were quite hurtful. I feel like they’ve come from people who don’t understand the term.Irish dance is like any other cultural art form, it was created to be shared. It’s a dance that was born out of oppression we can’t lose sight of that. For me, as a little black girl, it was a beautiful art I was desperate to be a part of. I was 10 when I first saw an Irish dancing recital, at the dance school where I was learning tap and ballet. I was mesmerised. My mum was a bit incredulous at first, but she let me give it a shot. I fell in love after my first class.Now I’m 20, and Irish dancing is my life. Competitions aren’t that regular in Virginia, but until recently I was travelling every weekend to compete in major events elsewhere in the US, or international shows in Glasgow, Dublin and London. I came 43rd in the last world championships in 2019 – that might not sound huge, but getting into the top 50 is a big achievement.I addressed the negative feedback in a post on social media by explaining that there are Irish dance schools all over the world. The supportive response was overwhelming and it felt like an educational moment. People in the US tell me they want to pick it up and are searching for schools, and Irish people are looking for their heavy shoes from childhood. The most surreal moment was a black mother telling me she let her daughter sign up for Irish dance classes because she saw me. I didn’t have someone who looked like me to look up to in what is historically a very white space. That I can be that person for young black dancers is an honour.Dance has been an outlet to take my mind off the craziness of the world. I teach my pre-kindergarten kids Irish dancing – they love the high kicks – and I’m pursuing my teaching certification. My plan is to go back to competing I just have to recover from some injuries. The Riverdance tour has been postponed for now, but when it comes to Virginia I’ll be there, dancing in the show. It will be a dream come true.• As told to Anna Cafolla.Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

The Irish siblings welcomed the millennium performing at the UK’s flagship Dome itself and finally converted their European success stateside. Despite the ubiquity, says lead singer Andrea Corr, few really saw the band for what they were: accomplished musicians, not three sisterly pinups (plus Jim). “That’s why we made sure we played our instruments,” she says. “You’re better off looking like a grungy band to be taken seriously, and we didn’t look like that.”Twenty years on from the release of their third album, the mainstream breakthrough In Blue, the objectification and dorky ridicule has dissipated as a erse array of young musicians reclaim a band they loved as kids. Taylor Swift put their song Breathless atop her Women’s History Month playlist, calling the Corrs “female professors” the Danish black-metaller Myrkur said they introduced her to the classic Irish folk songs behind her new album, Folkesange and Ed Sheeran said they inspired Galway Girl, the musical equivalent of selling coals to Newcastle. Most strikingly, the former Chairlift member Caroline Polachek has been doing an extraordinary live cover of Breathless that essayist Jia Tolentino described as “Enya-industrial”. Andrea can’t remember much of their peak. They were kept relentlessly busy: Breathless became the Corrs’ first UK No 1 single, later receiving the ultimate cultural kudos when it was sung by Tony’s daughter Meadow in The Sopranos. Andrea wrote it with the producer Mutt Lange, then-husband of Shania Twain and a man who knows radio so well that “he cuts a song so it ends at the perfect time for the DJ to speak”, she laughs. Her iconic vocal leap – mimicked perfectly in Polachek’s cover – came about because Lange had heard that Andrea could yodel. “There was a suggestion of yodelling, but not full yodelling!”While they wanted international success, Andrea was distressed by fame: “It made me more self-conscious and shy.” The momentum didn’t last into 2004’s Borrowed Heaven (which probably wasn’t helped by Jim spouting 911 conspiracy theories). “You always want it to last,” says Andrea. “But I don’t think we could have taken the intensity.” Does it feel like 20 years ago? “It does and it doesn’t,” she says. “Sometimes I feel like I’m watching somebody that isn’t me any more, which it isn’t, I suppose. We lived and breathed that life. Now I live and breathe another life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5053a7d12d5e2df9cb7cb752293057c911c1badf/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026s=deb110cb4cde351122a3824b59843890","title":"in conversation with benjamin zephaniah and george the poet pocast","story":"Benjamin Zephaniah and George the Poet are two of Britain’s most successful contemporary poets.

Miniature flares have been proposed as a theoretical explanation for the so-called coronal heating problem, but until now no telescope has had a good enough resolution to observe the sun’s atmosphere in sufficient detail.The latest footage, taken at 77m kilometres (48m miles) above the solar surface between the orbits of Venus and Mercury, reveals flickering beacons, each ning just a few hundred kilometres across and lasting minutes, before fizzling out again.“The campfires are little relatives of the solar flares that we can observe from Earth, million or billion times smaller,” said David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, a principal investigator on the mission. “The sun might look quiet at the first glance, but when we look in detail, we can see those miniature flares everywhere we look.”The $1.3bn mission was launched in February and will ultimately provide the first glimpses of the sun’s uncharted north and south poles when the probe reaches a vantage point above the planetary plane late next year.As it moves closer to the sun, the spacecraft will be exposed to scorching temperatures, requiring its camera and other instruments to be housed behind a titanium heat shield coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones. The instruments and camera peer through peepholes that shut whenever there is a risk of them overheating.The latest images show what is happening in the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the corona, that extends millions of kilometres into outer space. The coronal temperature is more than a million degrees Celsius, orders of magnitude hotter than the surface of the sun, which is a relatively cool 5,500C. Solar physicists have been trying for decades to resolve the mystery of why the corona is quite so hot. “One of the theories is that you have all these really small solar flares going off all the time all over the sun,” said David Long of UCL’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory, a principal investigator on the mission. “What we’re seeing in these images are there are very small brightenings going off all over the sun.”It is possible that the flares could provide enough energy to heat up the corona to its observed extreme temperature. Further observations and analysis are needed to confirm whether this is the case.Solar Orbiter is now on a tour of the inner solar system on the far side of the sun, meaning it is out of everyday contact with the Earth. That will bring it into an orbit about 42m kilometres from the sun over the next two years. By 2025, its orbit will have an inclination of 17° – high enough to take images of the sun’s poles – and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33°. Mission scientists say that observations of the poles could reveal the processes driving the Sun’s 11-year cycle of activity.• This article was amended on 16 July to correct the date when the Solar Orbiter’s incline would allow it to take images of the sun’s poles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d4ed12d043fb19edfdc22d2933866be5abad03/304_1239_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf66a29900af53069c225988c514e4fc","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"Following news that almost 650,000 people have left company payrolls since March, we would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirusThe number of people on company payrolls in the UK has dropped by almost 650,000 since March, as unemployment continues to soar due to the coronavirus pandemic.We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus over the last three months.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

That prompted fears PRL’s testing programme could be derailed, potentially posing a threat to the league’s hopes of restarting in mid-August.Randox however, released a statement, saying that the temporary measure “does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of swabs” and when contacted by PRL on Thursday offered the same reassurances. Following those discussions, it is understood that PRL is satisfied with the standard of its testing kits and does not intend to alter its programme.A Premiership Rugby spokesperson said: “We can confirm that our club testing programme is unaffected by the decision to temporarily suspend distribution of sample collection kits within the national testing programme. The sample collection kits provided to Randox Health’s private customers use a different supplier of swabs than the kits used within the national testing programme.”Under PRL’s programme, players and members of staff are tested once a week and the second round of testing, the results of which were released on Wednesday, produced nine positive tests, including seven players and two members of staff, from 856 tests. The previous week there were 10 positives, six of which were from players. Those who test positive are required to isolate, along with their “close contacts”, which is defined on an inidual basis, after a review of video footage of training sessions as well as GPS movements.Meanwhile, Maro Itoje has become the latest of Saracens’ England stars to commit his future to the club despite their relegation to the Championship. Itoje follows Owen Farrell, Billy and Mako Vunipola, Jamie George and Elliot Daly in pledging to stay despite the prospect of playing in the second tier next season. Itoje’s announcement comes just a day after Eddie Jones confirmed he would have no issue selecting Saracens’ stars next season despite the absence of top level opposition.It is believed that those senior players are unlikely to feature much in the Championship with Jones set to have greater access to them next season. Saracens are also in discussions over the possibility of sending them for a brief stint in Super Rugby next spring to prove themselves ready for the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour. “I’m really looking forward to the future the future is going to be brighter than our past,” said Itoje. “The future is in our hands and we have the power to shape our own destiny.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e491461b0efa404214672d35259daf0ed33e25df/0_132_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=145e1d10adc1edbdc5e585650e8b96b5","title":"10 of the best long distance walks trails in italy","story":"A new ‘slow tourism’ initiative is promoting 70 trails from Sicily to Friuli.

The aim is to help rural economies hit by months of lockdown.“In just a few days our lives changed,” says leading member Gianluigi Bettin, a guidebook writer and sustainable-tourism expert. “We became suddenly aware of our vulnerability. Now, even if our bodies are healthy, we can see that our society is not, and it’s not all down to Covid-19. Many of us see the chance, even the need, to reassess our lifestyle and values. And one simple way to do this is to walk more.”The network covers almost 70 trails (from four-stage walks of around 60km to one of 1,006km) and most are now well-organised with waymarking, GPS and accommodation listings.

Several of the town’s butchers offer hot food to take away or eat at simple paper-covered tables. It’s mostly meat, naturally, with grilled horse a speciality, but lots of other choices, depending on the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecccc90ad2af5295e2c052391c2ac38193b5bd1/0_180_768_461/master/768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae283c4361018846829a2a0db308fe2","title":"a single use face mask or one like amber heards how i learnt to choose wisely","story":"As more countries make coverings compulsory, Nazia Parveen experiences face mask envy during a work trip to MallorcaParis Hilton likes hers made from mesh, encrusted with rhinestones, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have opted to wear bandanas for their dramatic daily court appearances. Meanwhile, for most of us it’s the disposable versions that can be bought from most high-street chemists.But whether they are bejewelled with diamante or made out of beautiful cotton fabrics, wearing or not wearing a face mask in shops has become the latest polarising debate on social media – with the reaction ranging from the humorous to downright outrage.It will be compulsory to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July, with those who fail to follow the new rules facing a fine of up to £100.During a recent work trip to Mallorca, my first foreign excursion since the world hit self-destruct, I was confronted with the prospect of wearing a mask for long periods of time. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200715-53148-gdn.pw.200715.ds.to_mask_or_not_to_mask.mp3 My choice was a Superdrug pack of 10 single-use medical masks hurriedly purchased a day earlier. My mask went on the moment I stepped into Manchester airport and, bar a few short breaks to sip a drink and hurriedly eat a sandwich, it remained on for six hours until I reached my hotel.The following day, walking through the streets of Palma, popping into shops and getting on a bus, I once again donned my three-ply, ear-looped travel buddy, as it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in stores on the Spanish island.But as temperatures hit 30C the mask got sweaty and, with no escape for the warm air, nausea set in. I instantly started to regret my mask choice, jealously eyeing up those who had obviously done their research. I began to suffer from mask envy.Next came the not-so-attractive steamy sunglasses as my mask flipped about, not quite fitting the bridge of my nose. After hours of wearing the elasticated loops my ears began to chafe, an unusual, but distinct, discomfort behind my lobes.Lessons were well and truly learned, and I will be armed with research before future mask purchases, as more countries globally make it mandatory to wear them in public spaces.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.The Costa del Sol, where around 2.3 million Britons holiday every year, recently made it compulsory to wear masks in public at all times, in line with the other tourist hotspots of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Exceptions are made only for sunbathers on beaches and pools, when eating or drinking, while practising sport and while playing a wind instrument. However, in Catalonia tourists are still required to wear masks at the beach or by the pool.Across the border in France, the rules are slightly less stringent. While it is compulsory to wear face masks on public transport, it is up to inidual shop owners to ask their customers to wear face coverings. This, though, could be subject to change, with the French prime minister, Jean Castex, recently signalling that face mask use in enclosed public spaces was under consideration.Meanwhile, in Italy, although holidaymakers will not receive a fine for non-compliance, it is mandatory to use masks in enclosed public spaces. Flout it at your peril, as mask-less people will be removed from public transport.Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against the virus, followed by surgical grade masks, but they are costly and reserved for healthcare workers. Then there are the homemade reusable cloth versions and the single-use paper ones.Whatever you decide on, face masks are here to stay – for a while at least – so spend the next week choosing wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e814766b60ff64f8ee51b9af28f9f297fbaf671/143_465_3113_1868/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a646e2c4cb5c3d3454a84a0889c6bbf6","title":"uk government orders halt randox covid 19 tests over safety issues","story":"Care homes and members of public told to immediately stop using firm’s kitsThe UK government has instructed care homes and members of the public to immediately stop using coronavirus testing kits produced by a healthcare firm after safety problems were discovered.Randox was awarded a £133m contract in March to produce the testing kits for England, Wales and Northern Ireland without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.Under the contract, the kits are sent to the public and places such as care homes and then delivered back to Randox to check swabs to see if iniduals have the virus.On Thursday the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs: “We’ve identified some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we’ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.“And while we investigate further, we’re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits is paused in all settings until further notice. Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.”The Department of Health and Social Care did not explain the nature of the problem or say how many testing kits have been affected.In a statement, the department said its instruction only “applies to unused Randox test kits, which are clearly marked with that name. Used Randox test kits can still be collected for processing as normal.” Randox said: “As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batchsupplier of swabs. This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business which uses a different supplier of swabs.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health minister, tweeted: “Ministers overstated testing figures by 200,000 \u0026amp now home testing kits don’t meet safety standards with use of all Randox test kits paused.

He said a care home in his constituency where half of the residents had died from coronavirus could not secure testing for other residents.Menzies said: “Six of the remaining residents are displaying symptoms, but they are being told that they will have to wait until mid-June for further tests, following errors made by Randox a few weeks ago.” Hancock said at the time that he would try to resolve the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f070d69205d9846969c8b6dd86bb00a498614bcd/0_242_3184_1910/master/3184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e892e1d0a85a3004d3f39987c036bedb","title":"former catalan president amassed huge fortune through judge says","story":"Jordi Pujol, his wife Marta Ferrusola, his seven children and 18 other iniduals linked to the family will be chargedA Spanish judge plans to charge the former Catalan president Jordi Pujol, along with his wife Marta Ferrusola, his seven children and 18 other iniduals linked to the family, with forming a criminal organisation that used its political influence to amass “a disproportionate fortune”.Pujol was the first democratically elected president of Catalonia after the end of the Franco dictatorship at the end of the 1970s, a position he held for 23 years, during which time his Convergència i Unió party dominated the Catalan political scene.In his 509-page ruling, judge José de la Mata of the Audiencia Nacional, the criminal court that deals with terrorism and organised crime, said: “For decades the Pujol Ferrusola family has used its highly privileged position in Catalan political, social and economic life to accumulate huge wealth through corrupt activities.”De la Mata said a seven-and-a-half year investigation had exposed the family as a criminal organisation involved in money laundering, tax fraud and false documentation. The judge said that some of this activity took place from 1980 to 2003, when Pujol was the Catalan president.The scandal first broke in 2014 when Pujol admitted that he had failed to declare funds held in Andorra, which he claimed derived from his inheritance, a claim the judge says is unsubstantiated.During his time as regional president, Pujol played the kingmaker in Madrid, wringing more concessions and greater political autonomy for Catalonia in return for supporting minority governments on both right and left.The scandal emerged just as the Catalan independence movement was hitting its stride and was largely ignored or even dismissed by some Catalans as a Madrid-based conspiracy. But following Pujol’s initial confession, investigators uncovered a series of corrupt operations and cash for favours, especially on the part of his eldest son, also called Jordi.While many in Catalonia will see the development as another conspiracy hatched by a hostile Spanish state, for much of the country it will be a welcome sign that the judiciary is clamping down on the sort of corruption that has been a hallmark of Spanish political life for the past 40 years.According to the judge, the family concealed payments through fake contracts and tax havens and used its political influence to ensure that, in exchange for money, companies were awarded lucrative public contracts.The judge claims the organisation was led by Pujol and his wife, “who describes herself as the mother superior of the congregation” while the other key player was her son Jordi, known within the clan as “the parish priest”.When Pujol confessed to the undeclared inheritance in 2014, fellow party member Josep Rull described him as “a thinker and a statesman” and “the man who led the recovery of self-government and who governed Catalonia as a nation, not a region”.Rull was jailed last October for 10-and-a-half years for his part in the illegal declaration of independence in 2017. From today, he and the eight other jailed Catalan politicians will be allowed out of prison on day release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d80b62c41a01cc60f5b1fe87e47122be662ccb/0_191_4228_2538/master/4228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91ebb956409132f78034e35c4256444","title":"global report coronavirus infections india pass 1m mark","story":"Country becomes third in world to reach figure restrictions tightened in NSW, Australia India has become the third country to record more than 1m coronavirus infections, following the US and Brazil, as it reported 34,956 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 1,003,832.Amid evidence that the disease was taking hold in poorer, rural areas less well-served by public healthcare, the latest tally prompted renewed concerns about the country’s ability to cope with rising infections.The figures have been released after a week in which authorities in India were forced to impose new lockdowns, including fresh restrictions on 128 million people in the state of Bihar, which came into force on Thursday.The continuing and escalating outbreaks, on top of record cases in the US – which passed 75,000 daily cases in the last count – has dampened hopes that the pandemic is anywhere close to being brought under control, even as researchers race to find a viable vaccine.Three states in India – Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu – account for more than half of the total cases in the country so far. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, warned that the vast majority of cases in the country were still being missed.The continuing rise has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.In Bangalore the government ordered a week-long lockdown that began on Tuesday evening after a rapid increase in cases.In Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with more than 200 million people, authorities have begun placing residents under strict weekend curfews, which will remain in place until the end of the month.Other local governments are increasingly focusing on smaller lockdowns that shield the economy. Nearly a dozen states have imposed restrictions on containment zones that can be as small as a few houses or a street.Dr Anant Bhan, a global health researcher, said India was likely to experience a series of peaks as the virus spread in rural areas. He said the capital, New Delhi, and the financial capital, Mumbai, had already recorded surges, while infections have now shifted to smaller cities.India’s response to the virus was initially sluggish, but then on 24 March the prime minister, Narendra Modi, imposed a three-week nationwide lockdown of its 1.3-billion population.By Friday more than 13.8m infections had been confirmed worldwide and nearly 590,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Another centre of new infections has been Australia, where the most populous state, New South Wales, announced increased restrictions after detecting eight new Covid-19 cases.The state’s largest cluster, about 42 cases, has been traced to a visitor from Melbourne who visited a pub in Sydney. Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, has reported a record 428 new cases.The city and a neighbouring semi-rural area have been locked down since last week.In China, flights into the city of Ürümqi in the far-western Xinjiang region were restricted on Friday, and underground and public bus services suspended, according to local social media.The latest outbreak has underlined the continuing difficulty China faces in stamping out the virus – even with its imposition of draconian measures – which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Amid fears around the world over the ease in which new resurgences have escalated after countries relaxed restrictions, Hong Kong reported 50 new locally transmitted cases on Friday, stoking further concern about a third peak of infections in the global financial hub.Tokyo hit a daily high of 293 infections as Japan tries to keep the world’s third-largest economy running while curbing infections, a precarious balancing act of opening restaurants and theatres with limited seating, and having store clerks work behind plastic shielding.“We have asked people and businesses to raise their alert levels,” said the Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike. She said the recent higher numbers partly reflected more aggressive testing.Meanwhile, Indonesia said large-scale restrictions in its capital would continue as Covid-19 cases rise, with cinemas and other indoor entertainment spaces remaining closed.“It will be very risky if we loosen the first phase of large-scale social restrictions to the second phase. So we decided to extend the social restrictions,” said the governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan.As of Thursday, 15,636 cases with 713 deaths had been recorded in Jakarta. Sweeping social restrictions were imposed on 10 April but relaxed two months later. Indonesia has reported a total of nearly 82,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,800 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a759a82097bcae4e78ee02afb7267136bf0f9057/0_251_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6f8a2e9d103db09fb84bab30f2f817","title":"i am germany berlin alexanderplatz gets new hero in cinematic adaptation","story":"Burhan Qurbani’s hopeful reimagining of Alfred Döblin’s classic novel premieres in Berlin this weekThe story of a man who tried to be good “but then ran out of money”, Alfred Döblin’s classic novel Berlin Alexanderplatz has been described as a parable about the futility of ambition and morality in the twilight years of the Weimar Republic.However, a cinematic reinterpretation premiering in Berlin this week finds more hopeful meaning, pondering if the capital’s seedy underbelly could give birth to a modern, self-confidently multicultural Germany.Qurbani, born in western Germany to parents who fled the Soviet-Afghan war, told the  he was inspired to re-read Berlin Alexanderplatz, a set text at many German secondary schools, after moving to the capital.“That’s when this idea of two parallel societies began to overlap,” Qurbani said. “The damaged first-world-war veteran and the refugee traumatised by his journey across the ocean, both of whom have the hubris to say: ‘I belong not on the fringes, but the heart of society’.”In the novel, Biberkopf sells newspapers, vegetables and shoelaces before drifting into prostitution and organised crime. In the film, opening in Germany with a three-month delay due to the pandemic lockdown, Francis works his up way up the hierarchies of a gang in Berlin’s Volkspark Hasenheide, a 100-acre public green space in Neukölln district where dog-walking pensioners, wannabe acrobats and picnicking families coexist with a regimented network of mostly black men selling drugs.Where Döblin builds a literary montage out of Greek myths, folk songs, news reports and billboard adverts, Qurbani cites William Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt and Francis Ford Coppola. The film’s pivotal scene deliberately echoes the opening line of The Godfather: “I believe in America”.“I am here: black, strong, fearless”, says Francis. “I am wearing an expensive jacket, I drive a German car, I have a German girlfriend. I am the German dream. I am Germany”.When Rainer Werner Fassbinder adapted Berlin Alexanderplatz into a 14-part series for television in 1980, the enfant terrible of New German Cinema made the story of Franz Biberkopf’s short rise and long fall feel like a chamber drama.Qurbani’s film, a UK release for which is currently being negotiated, aspires to the type of epic Hollywood cinema about migration into America told by Scorsese or De Palma – “gangster movies that hold up a mirror to society”, the German director said.While critics have universally praised Qurbani’s ambition, some reviews have bemoaned the treatment of the novel behind the film: Die Zeit complained the director and his scriptwriter had managed to “erase everything that made their source material experimental, or challenging”, by investing too much of our hopes in Francis’ personal struggle.Die Welt, by contrast, was convinced that Qurbani’s reinterpretation “is here to stay like Fassbinder’s”, describing the Portuguese-Guinean actor Bungué’s modern-day Franz Biberkopf as “neither a sneaky asylum fraudster nor a poor victim of globalisation”, but “a modern hero, who has to quickly pick up the rules of an unknown environment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65db9aa3dcf73bdd26aff1a796e422caa1c11e24/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59463920bc3302a56fa78493fdef6cd0","title":"israel returns to partial lockdown with immediate weekend shutdown","story":"Government unveils measures after marathon emergency cabinet session as infections riseIsrael has reimposed some lockdown measures following a vigorous second surge in the number of coronavirus infections, putting in place stringent weekend shutdowns in which shops, hairdressers and attractions will be closed.The government announced the measures in the early hours of Friday morning, following a marathon emergency cabinet session called after daily infection rates climbed to close to 2,000.Gyms and fitness studios will also be closed at all times, while restaurants, which opened again in May, will return to takeaways and deliveries only. All indoor gatherings of 10 or more people will be banned.Changes start from this weekend, which in Israel begins on Friday afternoon, the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and last until Sunday, the first working day of the week. Nurseries will remain open, although closures were being considered.Israel Radio reported that full lockdowns, with people again confined to their homes, might be imposed from next weekend, after parliamentary approval.During the cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the government’s goal was to stop gatherings of people, but added that the new steps may not be “scientific”.Yair Lapid, the head of the opposition, criticised the partial lockdown, saying it was confusing and not based on evidence. “An entire country is trying to understand why decisions are made in the middle of the night without any data and isn’t able to,” he tweeted on Twitter on Friday.The country of 9 million was praised initially for a swift lockdown in March that was credited with reducing daily infections to single digits. However, officials and public health officials say the economy was reopened too hastily and without necessary steps taken to control the pandemic.With more than one in five Israelis unemployed, Netanyahu has faced mounting public anger over his handling of the crisis, with thousands of protesters holding frequent demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some of which have been dispersed by police.The Israeli leader is also fighting three corruption allegations, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust – accusations he denies, dismissing them as part of a politically-motivated witch-hunt.Outside his Jerusalem residence on Thursday night, several hundred people banged drums and blew on horns, calling for Israel’s longest-serving leader to resign. Some wore masks with “crime minister” written on them.Noam Arnonovitch, 32, who lives in Tel Aviv, said he had been seeking employment for a few months while working part-time in bars.“I came because I think there’s something very deeply wrong with our political culture in Israel,” he said, complaining of what he said was destructive us-versus-them discourse from the government.“I think that now, because of the extremity of the situation we’ve reached, people are really fed up and we’re starting to feel it in our pockets, in our refrigerators, and in our general sense of security.”Another demonstrator, Aramit Lotem, said Netanyahu had painted any dissenting voices as those of traitors. “It’s not only the virus,” the 61-year-old Jerusalem resident said. “The virus is really a good opportunity for Netanyahu to manipulate our liberty.”At a nearby counter-demonstration of about a dozen people, one person said he had come to protest against “the anarchists”. He accused the anti-Netanyahu camp of staging violent demonstrations. “I believe that if you want to change the leader, it’s at a vote.”On Wednesday, Netanyahu had presented a 6bn shekel (£1.4bn) package, with payments of up to £175 for iniduals, rising to nearly £700 for families, arguing it would boost spending and “get the economy moving faster”.The plan, which needs cabinet approval, was swiftly rejected by senior officials, including government ministers, who said the money should instead be targeted at the poorest citizens. One prominent Israeli columnist, Ben Caspit, accused the leader of “handing out bribes to the masses” to placate nationwide discontent.However, other polls have shown his ruling Likud party remains the most popular in the country, even if slightly fewer people would vote for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6e7bc89089c24f5b9291f52503d7e24fad5316/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=01289b0600d689b8ec43ac87efbcad2b","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 2m as more countries re introduce restrictions","story":"US sets highest one-day total for the pandemic so far Brazil cases pass 2m India cases top 1m Mexican authorities to impose local restrictionsCovid-19 cases in the France’s Brittany region, which is popular with tourists, have risen sharply in less than a week, according to government data. This is the latest indication that the virus is again gaining momentum in France.According to data released on today, the disease’s reproduction rate, known as the R0, in Brittany had risen from 0.92 to 2.62 between July 10 and July 14, Reuters reports. The number is one of several indicators authorities are watching when deciding on whether to reimpose tougher restrictions after ending the country’s lockdown in May.A reproduction rate of 2.62 means that each Covid-19 infected person is, on average, passing the disease on to between two and three other people. A rate of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease.The government on Thursday accelerated plans to make it compulsory to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces amid concerns about renewed spikes of Covid-19, especially in areas in western and southern France that had been relatively spared during the height of the outbreak between March and May.Barcelona residents were urged to stay at home and to not gather in groups of more than 10 as regional authorities aim to curb a rise in coronavirus cases, without imposing a mandatory lockdown.We recommend that people don’t move around if it’s not absolutely necessary.” It is very important to respect these measures now, it’s the best way to avoid a lockdown.”Residents were urged to shop online and cultural and sports events will also be limited, Reuters reports.Barcelona, which is Spain’s second largest city with a population of 1.6 million people, has seen its number of coronavirus cases increase from last week.Spain reported the steepest daily jump in coronavirus infections in over two months on Thursday, with 580 new cases registered. Spain has been one of Europe’s hardest hit countries with more than 28,000 deaths in the pandemic. It emerged from a strict national lockdown on 21 June but since then more than 170 clusters have appeared, prompting regional authorities to impose a patchwork of local restrictions.Authorities in the Czech Republic have tightened restrictions in the north-east of the country after a spike in cases. Compulsory face coverings, limited restaurant opening hours and ordering checks on cross-border commuters have been reinstated.There have been 335 Covid-19 related deaths in the country but it has seen a new spike in infections in the past three weeks, mostly concentrated in the industrial Moravia-Silesia region bordering Poland and Slovakia.The Czech Republic has reported more than 100 new cases in seven out of the past 10 days, with a large number from the north-east following an outbreak in the state-owned OKD coalmines, Reuters reports.The national tally of new positive cases hit 305 on 28 June when the mine outbreak peaked. The mine suspended most operations earlier this month after criticism that it had acted too slowly.Health minister Adam Vojtěch tweeted that from today the local hygienic station will extend the currently valid measures in the Karviná region to the entire region. In the region, the obligation to wear veils indoors and on public transport is being introduced.Urumqi, the capital of China’s far western region of Xinjiang, reported five new coronavirus cases on Friday, after the report of an earlier case, its first in months. The new cases has led to hundreds of flights being cancelled.The city also reported eight new asymptomatic cases, the regional health commission said, taking Xinjiang’s tally to six infections and 11 asymptomatic patients.Subway services have also been suspended in Urumqi on Thursday.On Thursday, health authorities in Urumqi said a 24-year-old woman with symptoms such as a sore throat, fever and headaches, tested positive for the virus. Three people with whom she had close contact tested positive but did not show symptoms.Also on Thursday, the eastern province of Zhejiang reported an asymptomatic case involving a traveller from Xinjiang.The tally of mainland China’s confirmed infections was 83,622 by the end of Thursday, with the number of deaths remaining at 4,634. Another 104 asymptomatic patients were under observation.Beijing reported no new cases for an 11th consecutive day.This was still significantly below the 1,600 daily new cases the country logged at the peak of the pandemic.With the latest numbers and the recent increases of confirmed cases, you can clearly see that we are at the start of a second wave”However, Yves van Laethem, a spokesman for the Belgian health ministry, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF that the prospect of a second wave appeared to be localised to particular provinces for now. Speaking to Le Soir newspaper, virologist Marius Gilbert echoed this, adding that transmission rates remain relatively low.Health Minister Maggie de Block today called on Belgians to respect social distancing rules.Boris Johnson has unveiled the next steps in England’s coronavirus response, Simon Murphy reports.At a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister highlighted that local authorities will have new powers in their areas to enable the closure of specific premises, shut outdoor spaces and cancel events.In addition, new regulations will allow the government to intervene in local areas. He said: “Action for local councils will not always be sufficient, so next week we will publish draft regulations which clearly set out how central government can intervene more effectively at a local level.“Where justified by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors, or types of premises in an area or introduce local stay-at-home orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the maximum size of gatherings beyond national rules or restrict transport systems serving local areas.” Johnson also said during the press conference he hopes for a “return to normality, possibly in time for Christmas”. Reuters is reporting Catalonia’s regional authorities announced today they will restrict some activities in Barcelona, including asking people not to gather in groups of more than 10, to fight an increase in coronavirus cases. They have stopped short of imposing a lockdown and said the measures were meant to avoid having to do so.Good morning. I’m Gregory Robinson, taking over from Amelia Hill.

I wish you a very fine rest-of-day and an even finer weekend.Although the eurozone suffered its biggest recession in generations, recent data suggest the economy bottomed out in April or May and a recovery is under way, even if it is bound to be choppy, uneven and prone to setbacks.The meeting between EU leaders continues. It’s their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis but there are low expectations of a deal as the leaders acknowledged that they are about as far apart from reaching a deal on an unprecedented €1.85tn ($2.1tn) EU budget and virus recovery fund as the seating distance imposed upon them for health reasons at their summit centre.“The differences are still very, very big and so I can’t predict whether we will achieve a result this time”, German chancellor Angela Merkel told Reuters, as she arrived at the Europa summit site. “I expect very, very difficult negotiations.”The challenges facing the 27 EU leaders some of whom arrived masked, some unmasked are formidable, Reuters reports. Their bloc is suffering through the worst recession in its history and member states are fighting over who should pay the most to help other countries and which nations should get the most to turn around their battered economies.The BBC is reporting that French president Emmanuel Macron said it was a “moment of truth” for Europe and the next hours would be decisive.The main issue is how much of the recovery fund will be handed out in grants and how much in loans. They also need to agree on a seven-year budget worth another €1.07tn.European council president Charles Michel acknowledged that the talks would be “very difficult”, but Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said nobody should lose sight of the big picture: “We’re faced with the biggest economic depression since the second world war.”Despite the allegations that Russian hackers tried to steal UK coronavirus vaccine research, Russia says it expects a deal for it to make a Covid-19 vaccine that is being developed by Astrazeneca and Oxford University to go ahead. Reuters is reporting that Russia sees western allegations that it tried to steal others’ vaccine data as an attempt to “unfairly undermine credibility” of its own vaccine.The Trump administration is considering banning travel to the US by all members of the Chinese Communist party and their families, Reuters is reporting. Quoting “a person familiar with the matter”, the move would almost certainly prompt retaliation against Americans seeking to enter or remain in China and exacerbate tensions between the two nations.Senior officials discussing the matter have begun circulating a draft of a possible presidential order but deliberations are at an early stage and the issue has not yet been brought to President Donald Trump, the anonymous source is reported as having said.First reported by the New York Times, discussions centre on whether to deny visas to tens of millions of Chinese in what would be one of Washington’s toughest actions yet in a widening feud with Beijing that some have likened to a new Cold War.Such a ban, if implemented, could hit the ruling Communist party from the highest levels down to its rank-and-file and would be certain to draw retaliation against Americans who travel to China. This could include not only diplomats but also business executives, potentially harming US interests in China.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said earlier such action by the US, if true, would be “pathetic”.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo stopped short of confirming it was under consideration but said: “We’re working our way through, under the president’s guidance, about how to think about pushing back against the Chinese Communist party.”The New York Times reports that the presidential proclamation, still in draft form, could also authorise the US government to revoke the visas of party members and their families who are already in the country, leading to their expulsion. Some proposed language is also aimed at limiting travel to the US by members of the People’s Liberation Army and executives at state-owned enterprises, though many of them are likely to also be party members.Still on the race to develop a vaccine, the South China Morning Post is reporting that researchers in Australia have devised a test that can determine novel coronavirus infection in about 20 minutes.Using blood samples in what they say is a world-first breakthrough, the researchers at Monash University said their test can determine both if someone is currently infected and if they have been infected in the past.“Short-term applications include rapid case identification and contact tracing to limit viral spread, while population screening to determine the extent of viral infection across communities is a longer-term need,” the researchers said in a paper published in the journal ACS Sensors on Friday.Hundreds of samples can be tested every hour, the researchers said, and they hope it can also be used to detect antibodies raised in response to vaccination to aid clinical trials.A patent for the innovation has been filed and the researchers are seeking commercial and government support to scale up production.In (potentially) positive news, Reuters is reporting that India’s Zydus Cadila plans to complete late-stage trials for its potential coronavirus vaccine in March 2021 and could produce up to 100 million doses a year if trials are successful.Cadila’s vaccine candidate, dubbed ZyCov-D, is one of dozens being developed around the world to fight the coronavirus.The Times of India reported on Covaxin, another Indian vaccine, which has been approved for clinical testing. Produced by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, Covaxin is also underway to start testing. Participants across regions have been identified and more updates regarding the same are awaited.The paper reports that the work on Zydus Cadila’s novel vaccine was accelerated after authorities found promising results in pre-clinical trials, which were conducted on animals like mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats who developed necessary antibodies to fight the infection. It was also found that the vaccine candidate was by far safe and “well-tolerated” in early studies.Interestingly, the paper notes, Zydus Cadila is also involved in the production of experimental anti-viral medication to treat COVID-19, the much-debated Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).The South China Morning Post is reporting that African leaders are ‘turning on’ their citizens as efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus fall short and already fragile health care systems struggle to cope with an influx of patients.The message from governments in several nations that initially praised their citizens for supporting efforts to contain the pandemic has shifted, with some officials now chastising them for not doing enough.The paper reports that the change in tone marks an attempt by the continent’s leaders to absolve themselves of some of the responsibility for the escalating number of infections, and head off potential social unrest, quoting Amaka Anku, head of the Eurasia Group’s Africa practice.Infections took off relatively slowly in the world’s poorest continent after many nations imposed stringent lockdowns, but confirmed cases soared as economies reopened, breaching the 600,000 mark this week. Maintaining physical distancing has proved difficult in many crowded slums, and appeals to wear masks have often gone unheeded, with some questioning the seriousness of the disease.In South Africa, which has almost half the continent’s confirmed virus cases, the government has faced criticism for imposing some seemingly arbitrary lockdown rules that caused undue economic hardship. While the authorities initially conceded they had made mistakes and pledged to rectify them, President Cyril Ramaphosa went on the offensive this week and railed against those who went on drinking sprees, organised parties and failed to wear masks in public."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Staged deadlines now might look impressive politically but would be unfair to those living in the centres, he adds.The current system has “always been ad hoc” and was never properly planned, he says. “So-called improvements” have been made over the years, but no consistency has been maintained. “Ending direct provision is a key priority,” he says.The coalition’s programme for government states direct provision will be replaced with a “new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”, backed by a properly funded current and capital budget.So far O’Gorman has met with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to discuss the handover of the direct provision portfolio from the Department of Justice to his new department, but both will have to continue to work closely together. A “fairly substantial” number of Justice staff will have to move.Community supportThe support of local communities for the changes to come after the ending of direct provision will be vital, says O’Gorman: “Engage early, engage accurately and engage comprehensively.“The earlier you start speaking to people, the more information you give them and the more correct that information is, the less chance you have for far-right groups to spread malicious lies.”“As soon as a State body is seen to try and be quiet or mysterious, it allows conspiracy theorists on the far right to fan the flames of public concern,” says O’Gorman, who points to the lessons that must be learned from last year’s protests in Oughterard.Asked if he is worried that an Irish pledge to offer own-door accommodation to asylum seekers will spur more arrivals, he says people quit their homes because of violence and persecution in their home countries.“When you look at the dangers people are fleeing – violence, civil war and climate catastrophes – the push factors are massive. It’s these push factors that are going to determine the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland. I don’t think it’s the pull factors primarily.”The new system may “not satisfy everyone’s demands”, he accepts. But if asylum decisions are made in a shorter time and people can live in a more dignified way, he will feel “we’ve achieved a lot”.The Government could also be “a bit more outspoken about the quiet dictators who through their actions and repression of human rights in their own countries are generating asylum seekers”, he adds.Driving licenceMoving people out of emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB accommodation is a priority to ensure that they get proper supports, while special support services for victims of sexual violence will also be considered, he says.A 2018 attempt to let asylum seekers find work was “embarrassing and complicated”, he says. “I think taking that meanness out of the system is something that we need to look at those small things like making it really hard to get a driver’s licence.”Decisions on asylum applications should be made within nine months to a year, rather than the average 15 months that applied before the pandemic, while asylum seekers should not have to wait nine months before being able to work, he says.Last week’s Ombudsman for Children’s report raises “concerning” information about widespread racism, bullying and exclusion experienced by asylum seeker children in schools throughout the State.“We see from other countries if a gap grows up in that trust ... that creates the potential for trouble in the future.” O’Gorman has himself been the target for social media trolling in recent weeks.However, he declines to debate matters again, saying he has paid “precisely zero attention” to a protest outside Leinster House last Saturday that called for his resignation because he had marched alongside British activist Peter Tatchell at Dublin’s Pride march two years ago.“My focus is on doing this job and I’m not going to be distracted by a small minority no matter how vocal they might be,” he says, adding that he had attended a commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre that day."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Two other teenagers

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

How to have a fulfilling job that pays enough money not to be miserable, but also enjoy family life? Much effort has been expended discussing the possibilities of achieving that elusive equilibrium.Now, though, Pandora’s Box has been opened, and it seems increasingly unlikely that we’re going to get those tricksy sprites back in. At the beginning of lockdown, a meme went round of a woman sitting at her kitchen table being told she could go back to work. She rattles off, in one long breath, her pre-lockdown daily routine – the getting up early every day to leave the house at 7.45am, packing on to a crowded train, spending £3 on a latte she can’t afford because she hasn’t had time for breakfast, making small talk to colleagues all day, dropping another £8 on lunch and finally getting home really late, beans on toast for dinner and flopping into bed at 10pm, ready to go again the next day. “F––– that”, she says at the end, before pouring herself another glass of wine.It struck a chord because, really, that’s how a lot of us – at least those of us who are able to work from home – feel. Now that we’ve been liberated from the tyranny of the daily commute, the office presenteeism, the offputting habits of our colleagues and endless, tedious meetings – and marvelled at how much we were spending just to go to work every day – why would we choose to go back?Every day, it seems, I talk to friends who, once we’ve stopped grumbling about the newly enlarged size of the weekly food bill and our partner’s irritating work voice, swiftly move on to extolling the glories of their new life.One, an oil trader with four children, has declared he never wants to go back to the office, but just wants to convene with his colleagues once a week for a night out. Another has put her house on the market and is fleeing with her family to rural Oxfordshire, now she’s unlikely to ever be required in the office more than two days a week.Of course, there are downsides. However irritating the colleagues, it can get a little lonely being at home day in, day out. It’s harder to climb the greasy pole without showing face in the office. Younger, single colleagues with no family to turn their attention to at the end of the day report finding it harder to switch off from work. If you’ve got kids, there’s always the risk of a Zoom-bomb. But many have made the calculation that it’s worth it regardless.This is what the PM is up against in his plea for us all to get back to the office and save our city centres. But now that we’ve finally found some worklife balance, why would we go back to the office just to prop up Pret?The news that MPs and peers might temporarily decant to York while Parliament is being renovated is enough to precipitate my own thoughts of escape from the capital.I grew up just outside York, and every time we go to visit my parents I spend an inordinate amount of time on Rightmove. York ticks all my boxes as an alternative to London: it’s got a cathedral for spiritual and musical life, a university for cultural and intellectual stimulation, and a river for aesthetic pleasure.

Vaccine trials for coronavirus, funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund, had gone so well at two separate institutions that Vladimir Putin could look forward to announcing the world\u0027s first approved vaccine for the virus by the end of the year. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the powerful Russian Direct Investment Fund, a close ally of President Putin, announced at a press conference in Moscow on Thursday that advanced Phase III trials would begin next month, with a plan to produce 30 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by December.Lucrative manufacturing deals had been signed with five other countries to produce a further 170 million doses, said Mr Dmitriev.Almost 2,000 miles away in London, just as Russia was boasting of its breakthrough, intelligence agencies in the UK were painting a different picture, announcing that they had uncovered a plot by Russian actors that has targeted coronavirus vaccine development in the UK, the US and Canada.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a branch of GCHQ, said it had found evidence that a cyber hacking group – Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), better known in the cyber sphere as Cozy Bear – had attempted to steal vaccine secrets being developed in the UK at both the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.Cozy Bear is run by Russian intelligence agencies, either the SVR (equivalent to MI6) or the domestic FSB (formerly the KGB).The prize is clear, because any country that produces a coronavirus vaccine first will have a huge advantage in getting their economy fully functioning before any other. APT 29 had also tried to hack into vaccine research centres in the US and Canada, and on Thursday, the three allied countries decided they had had enough and chose to call out the Russians.Intelligence agencies were guarded about the success of the attacks, which have been launched regularly since the centres first started trying to find a vaccine. We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic, said Paul Chichester,  NCSC Director of Operations, in a rare intervention in the normally secret world in which the intelligence agencies operate.A source said: APT29\u0027s campaign of malicious activity is ongoing, predominantly against government, diplomatic, think tank, healthcare and energy targets to steal valuable intellectual property.The NCSC gave a large amount of detail, even releasing the digital fingerprints of the tools used by the Cozy Bear hackers in an attempt to help institutions update their cyber defences to protect themselves against similar attacks.That information, released on Thursday, included the IP addresses of servers used by the Russian hackers to control their software, as well as other snippets of code which cybersecurity experts can use to update their networks to automatically scan for and remove the malware.Experts said the attacks were sophisticated, reliant on funding from Russian intelligence to develop Cozy Bear\u0027s cyber weaponry. Cozy Bear had developed two new forms of malicious software – WellMess and WellMail – which allowed them to silently search for research data and funnel it out of the university computer systems without raising alarms.WellMess acts as a portal to smuggle out stolen documents, while WellMail sends hackers information on the username of whoever is logged in to a computer.The software had never publicly been named or examined until the disclosure of the coronavirus hacking attempts.Whitehall sources said there was nothing audacious about the attacks. In stark contrast to the Kremlin-sanctioned, attempted assassination in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal using military-grade nerve agent, the hackers have been operating from the safety of Russian soil.This is a classic Russian modus operandi of trying to steal our intellectual property, said a Whitehall security source. This graph shows how it can work. Reports have suggested the Cozy Bear hackers work from office blocks in St Petersburg and Moscow, as well as universities.The Putin regime has for years recruited thousands of promising young computer programmers who could use their expertise for hacking into computer systems in other countries, and on Thursday, investigators working within GCHQ, NCSC and MI5 were confident enough to declare for the first time that Cozy Bear is an offshoot of Russian intelligence.The hackers strike by testing vulnerable systems and finding weak points. They can send out so-called spear phishing emails which impersonate someone the target already knows, such as their manager or a university IT administrator.According to experts, these fake emails tricked targets into logging on to websites which appear to be legitimate university web pages but are actually cleverly designed fakes. When university researchers logged on to the fake pages, they handed their usernames and passwords to Russian hackers.The hackers also frequently scanned the internet in search of any stolen passwords and saved up a large database of stolen credentials in case they ever became useful for future hacking campaigns.It is not as though Oxford wasn\u0027t aware of the threat. The vaccine research is being carried out at the state of the art Jenner Institute, on the edge of Oxford and a couple of miles from the historic university centre.Last month, Professor Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute and the co-leader of the Oxford vaccine project, told The  that his team were regularly targeted by nuisance people sending so-called phishing emails.The NCSC, he said, was helping the university defend its research from cyber attackers.You know, there are serious IT people who are giving us a huge amount of priority, he said. We treat it very carefully.”Guards had been placed at entrances to the building. I guess they\u0027re stopping anyone who might want to break in and steal the vaccine, which we could take as a compliment, I suppose, he said. But the main issue is data security. We take it extremely seriously.Cozy Bear has spent years honing its skills, and has become particularly adept at breaking into organisations in search of classified information.It first came to public attention when hackers broke into an American research organisation and planted what appeared to be an innocent-looking video of monkeys wearing shirts and ties. But when amused employees shared the video, in the background the file spread malware inside networks that gave hackers access to secret files.In 2014, the Dutch secret services pulled off an audacious intelligence coup by hacking into the security camera system used in a Moscow university building that housed members of Cozy Bear. Dutch spies watched them plan an attack on a US government network which was subsequently thwarted.It didn\u0027t stop the group and, in 2016, Cozy Bear hacked into the US Democratic National Committee alongside a rival Russian group, Fancy Bear. The hack may have changed the course of the US presidential election. After that, Cozy Bear went quiet for a couple of years before targeting Eastern European countries.It is unclear whether the attempts to steal vaccine secrets were successful. There are currently two rival research teams developing coronavirus vaccines in Russia – one at the Gamalei National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology and another at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University.Sechenov is backed by the Russian health ministry, while vaccine trials at the Gamalei Institute are funded by Russia\u0027s sovereign wealth fund. The Gamalei Institute, it should be stressed, is a reputable research centre.Russia has denied responsibility. We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin.We can say one thing – Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk may already have enough herd immunity prevent second coronavirus","story":"The UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus, an Oxford University study has suggested.Scientists believe the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.It is widely believed that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) required to prevent a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 is in excess of 50 per cent for any epidemiological setting, the study says.Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths, and suggest that sufficient herd immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.Leading experts have already suggested that a sizeable number of people may have immunity against coronavirus because of its similarity to viruses including the common cold.The Oxford model, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggests that when resistant people mix with non-resistant people, the herd immunity threshold drops sharply.Read the full study hereGiven the mounting evidence that exposure to seasonal coronaviruses offers protection against clinical symptoms, it would be reasonable to assume that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 itself would confer a significant degree of clinical immunity, the study says.Thus, a second peak may result in far fewer deaths, particularly among those with comorbidities in the younger age classes.Last month, Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who is working with a team at Oxford to develop a vaccine, said there was likely to be a background level of protection for a significant number of people.There is probably background T-cell immunity in people before they see the coronavirus, and that may be relevant that many people get a pretty asymptomatic disease, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"captain tom moore knighthood sir knighted queen ceremony","story":"Captain Sir Tom Moore will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle this afternoon to receive his knighthood in person. The veteran, aged 100, led a fundraising effort that encouraged members of the public to donate tens of millions of pounds to National Health Service charities during the coronavirus lockdown.Captain Sir Tom is to receive his honour in exceptional circumstances - outside of the usual timescale for knighthoods, and at a time when the pandemic has led to the postponement of all other honours being conferred.It is set to be another special day in an extraordinary few months for the man that the Prime Minister, who made the nomination for the knighthood, described as a national treasure.Captain Sir Tom Moore is to receive his knighthood from the Queen at 3pm today.He said that he could never have imagined this would happen and that it would be the most special of days when he finally meets the Queen.In a tweet sent on Friday morning, Capt Sir Tom Moore wrote: Ready and raring to go for what is a very special day. Thank you for all the well wishes, as ever, overwhelmed by your support.He added the hashtag #TodayWillBeAGoodDay.The ceremony is to take place outdoors at Windsor Castle, where the Queen has been in self-isolation with Prince Philip since March 19.The ceremony is to be staged in the quadrangle at the castle, where a military ceremony was held to mark the Queen\u0027s official birthday back in June.Capt Sir Tom will be joined for the ceremony by his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore, his son-in-law Colin Ingram, and his grandchildren Benjie and Georgina.The public has been urged to stay away from the mid-afternoon ceremony in line with continued government guidance on social distancing protocols.Both the Queen and Capt Sir Tom have been credited with providing a much-needed boost to national morale during the lockdown, becoming heroes of the pandemic through the respective reassurance and inspiration that they offered to the public.Capt Sir Tom Moore\u0027s knighthood is unusual in that it was announced inidually by the Prime Minister outside of the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours and the New Year\u0027s Honours.The knighthood also comes at a time when the royal investitures have generally been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Boris Johnson made a special nomination for the Army officer to be knighted on May 19, and said that he had provided the country with a beacon of light.The knighthood was approved by the Queen, and formally announced on May 20.On announcing the conferment of the honour, Mr Johnson described Capt Sir Tom Moore as a true national treasure who embodied the national solidarity that has grown throughout this crisis.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: On occasion, the Queen invests iniduals privately during audiences.Captain Sir Tom and his family were hopeful the investiture could take place in a timely fashion and we are pleased it has been possible on this occasion.Capt Sir Tom\u0027s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore told BBC Breakfast this morning: It is just the most sensational day - of all the things Tom has been honoured by, this is just truly the absolute icing on the cake.She said that she believes this is the first ever inidual investiture, and that protocol is being written as we speak and we will simply be doing as we are told.Capt Sir Tom\u0027s grandson Benjie added that it is a really special day for the entire family, and extended his thanks to everyone who had shown their support.Capt Sir Tom is receiving a knighthood after raising a total of £32.7 million for NHS charities via a Just Giving page at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.On April 6, two weeks into Britain\u0027s lockdown, he began to walk laps around his garden in aid of NHS Charities Together, and initially hoped to raise £1,000 in funds by the time he turned 100.He soon became a much-loved household name, with his fundraising page receiving more than 1.5 million indvidual donations and extensive coverage of his extraordinary life story.Born in Keighley, West Yorkshire on April 30 1920, Captain Tom completed a civil engineering apprenticeship before joining the Army, and was enlisted into the eighth battalion of the Duke of Wellington\u0027s Regiment (8 DWR).This was an infantry unit that was converted to operate Churchill tanks as part of the Royal Armoured Corps. In 1940, Sir Capt Tom was selected for officer training and rose to the rank of captain, going on to receive a promotion to 9 DWR in India.He then served and fought in the Arakan, west Burma, which has since been renamed Rakhine State. Post-war, he returned to the UK and started work as an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Dorset.As the nation came together to honour its war heroes on May 8, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Captain Sir Tom Moore reminisced about how his troops were under fire constantly and there was an element of discomfort during the Second World War.He also reminisced about hearing the Forces\u0027 Sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn, who in June passed away aged 103, serenading him and other soldiers.Captain Tom\u0027s fundraising total passed £30 million on April 30 - the day of his 100th birthday - and by the end of the charity campaign he had become a much-loved household name after extensive coverage and public tributes.A special flypast was held for Captain Tom\u0027s 100th birthday with two RAF planes, a Hurricane and a Spitfire, which took place over his village in Bedfordshire.The Royal Family confirmed that the Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, the Queen\u0027s representative in the county, had also delivered in person a birthday card from the monarch to Captain Tom.Well-wishers included the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told Captain Tom in a video message: “Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the entire nation.You’ve created a channel to enable millions to say a heartfelt thank you to the remarkable men and women in our NHS who are doing the most astounding job.Mr Johnson added that he had become a point of light in all our lives, and praised his service to others.In recognition of his work, Captain Tom has also been made an honorary colonel by the Ministry of Defence, received the Freedom of the City of London, and even been made an honorary member of the England cricket team in acknowledgement of his favourite sport.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality

had reached an agreement with its pilots to sack 350 and another 300 in \u0027pool\u0027 for rehiring when needed.The majority of pilots being \u0027pooled\u0027 were expected to be the jumbo jet

February 2019.The US-based aerospace company and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane, when they set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet program at least a year

As a result, prior to our work, wireless vision has not been possible for small robots or insects.”The camera weighs about 250 milligrams, which is about one-tenth the weight of a playing card, and was placed on the back of two beetles: a death-feigning beetle and a Pinacate beetle.It transmits images at one to five frames per second and sits on a mechanical arm that can rotate 60 degrees.Using this mechanism, researchers can get a high-resolution, panoramic shot of the beetle’s environment.The challenging in developing the cameras was not image quality or weight, but battery life.Smartphone cameras, while small, require batteries too big to be carried around by insects. As such, the researchers had to use a tiny, low-power black and white camera which moves when a high voltage is applied to it.During social distancing could these Japanese robots be the answer?They turn their heads to steer where they want to see with extra clarity, such as for chasing prey or a mate. This saves power over having high resolution over their entire visual field.”The benefit of using this method is that the researchers can track an object without having to expend excess energy moving the whole robot.The camera system was also used to design what the University of Washington say is the “world’s smallest terrestrial, power-autonomous robot with wireless vision”.It uses vibrations to move, and uses as much power as a Bluetooth radio. It can move at a rate of two to three centimetres per second – apparently faster than any other tiny robot which uses vibrations to move - and has a battery life of 90 minutes.These cameras could be used to explore previously-unreachable environments and, in the future, could potentially be solar-powered.“This is the first time that we’ve had a first-person view from the back of a beetle while it’s walking around. There are so many questions you could explore, such as how does the beetle respond to different stimuli that it sees in the environment?” Vikram Iyer, a electrical and computer engineering doctoral student who also authored the research, said.“Also, insects can traverse rocky environments, which is really challenging for robots to do at this scale. So this system can also help us out by letting us see or collect samples from hard-to-navigate spaces.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They claimed they were told it reflected poorly on “Ellen’s brand”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany of the accusers alleged that the show’s environment is “dominated by fear”, with employees who don’t raise concerns about work hours or microaggressions being rewarded. A source claimed: “They feel that everybody who works at The Ellen Show is lucky to work there — ‘So if you have a problem, you should leave because we’ll hire someone else because everybody wants to work here.’”While most of the former employees did not blame DeGeneres herself for the workplace environment, one argued that she ought to “take more responsibility” on the show’s set.Netflix releases list of top 10 most-watched original films everThe 2012 Olympics brought Britain together – look at us nowChinonye Chukwu: ‘Society doesn’t care about black women’s humanity’“If she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what’s going on,” the former employee said. “I think the executive producers surround her and tell her, ‘Things are going great, everybody’s happy,’ and she just believes that, but it’s her responsibility to go beyond that.”In a statement to BuzzFeed, The Ellen Show’s executive producers Ed Glavin, Mary Connelly and Andy Lassner said: “Over the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes, and employing over 1000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe, and inclusive work environment. We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It’s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us.”They continued: “For the record, the day to day responsibility of the Ellen show is completely on us. We take all of this very seriously and we realise, as many in the world are learning, that we need to do better, are committed to do better, and we will do better.”DeGeneres’s show was at the centre of a scandal in March when comedian Kevin T Porter pledged to donate $2 to a Los Angeles food bank for every “insane story” his followers tweeted to him about DeGeneres, whom he branded “notoriously one of the meanest people alive”.Earlier this month (2 July), the show’s production company denied speculation that it will be cancelled as a result of the “mean” allegations against its host.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.That is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5,500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat the corona are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It is possible the nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeYannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter deputy project scientist at ESA, said in a statement: “It’s obviously way too early to tell, but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries.”“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” said Daniel Muller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter project scientist. “Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner solar system, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of the campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (Spice), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the Spice Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six to monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.These include the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser, which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun that can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shock waves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument,” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to short out, sparking fires. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300bn to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort by many countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa in the United States.It was built in the UK by Airbus Defence and Space, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the solar system’s closest planet to the Sun.Gravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park.

Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session.Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism is much in evidence. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago.

Scientists from Oxford University point to evidence that seasonal coronaviruses may have provided people with some degree of immunity and other may be more naturally resistant to infection.Fears that a second wave of Covid-19 may arrive in the winter and cripple the NHS have been raised, with scientists urging ministers and health chiefs to plan now to get the UK ready for the winter. Experts said a major expansion of the test and trace system will be needed, as well as a roll-out of a major flu vaccination scheme and a nationwide disease surveillance system.On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a partial relaxation of lockdown restrictions imposed in the city of Leicester. The city’s mayor has criticised the government for taking a “sledgehammer approach” to the lockdown, which he said should only be imposed on 10 per cent of the city where infection rates are higher.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Peter Soulsby said he was not surprised but was “bitterly disappointed” by the announcement and accused the government of making a “party political” decision.New outbreaks in Yorkshire spark ‘growing concern’Government\u0027s \u0027work from home\u0027 advice to be relaxed from 1 AugustStudy: UK population may have high level of immunity to avoid second wave of Covid-19Leicester mayor \u0027bitterly disappointed\u0027 by lockdown extensionPM to announce additional\u0026nbsp£3bn funding for NHSIndoor theatre expected to resume from 1 AugustLive indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences from 1August.The prime minister said indoor performances with live audiences will be allowed, subject to the success of pilots, and trials will begin of larger gatherings in places like sport stadiums.However, some arts venues have said it is not financially viable to reopen with social distancing in place.Director and choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne wrote on Twitter: Why make these announcements when they know that the vast majority of theatre, dance and music is not financially viable under \u0027Covid secure\u0027 conditions?It comes after the government announced a £1.57 billion support package to protect the future of Britain\u0027s arts, with museums, galleries and theatres, independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues eligible for emergency grants and loans.Some theatres have already closed down, making staff redundant, amid the pandemic and high-profile industry figures have warned\u0026nbspthe industry might never recover without significant intervention.\u0026nbsp\u0027Hope for the best, plan for the worst\u0027 says PM about families meeting at Christmas\u0026nbsp\u0027I think you\u0027d be ok\u0027: Boris Johnson unclear over advice on visiting grandparents\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAustralia sees \u0027disturbing\u0027 coronavirus surgeAustralia\u0027s Victoria state has reported a record daily increase in Covid-19 cases, while neighbouring New South Wales said it was banning dancing, singing and mingling at weddings as authorities struggle to contain a new wave of infections.Victoria, which has forced nearly 5 million people in the country\u0027s second most populous state into a partial lockdown for more than a week, said it has found 428 new\u0026nbspcases in the last 24 hours, most from community transmission.The Victoria outbreak led to Australia posting its second biggest one-day rise in new Covid-19 infections today. It was the largest 24-hour spike since late March, when most cases detected in Australia were people returning from overseas.These are large numbers today, that is disturbing, Australia\u0027s acting chief medical officer Paul Kelly told reporters, adding:\u0026nbspBe patient... we are starting to get on top of the situation in Victoria.The surge in new cases reinforced expectations that Victoria will implement tougher restrictions on residents.The state has already extended a ban on international arrivals by three weeks to at least Aug. 8, Melbourne Airport said.Stricter restrictions would inevitably crimp economic activity in a country facing its first recession in nearly three decades.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.After two long weeks under lockdown, there is to be no respite for some of Leicester – not just yet. Another fortnight of restrictions beckons for the city and its people. Beyond that, who knows what lies in store for this corner of the country.“I’m fed up, really fed up,” says Sylvia Beynon, a resident of Oadby. The borough, along with Wigston and Leicester itself, is set to remain in lockdown due to its high incidence of cases – yet neighbouring areas have been given the green light to finally lift certain measures from 24 July.“It’s not fair, it really isn’t. I’m just so upset and angry,” adds Ms Beynon. “I think we’re being hung out to dry. We’re all doing exactly what we’re supposed to do. We’re getting the tests, we’re following the rules, we’re doing what’s been asked of us. People’s patience is starting to run thin.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAgainst mounting anger on the ground, the government has made its position and approach clear. Addressing the House of Commons on Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock said the continuation of the lockdown was “vital for the health of everyone in Leicester”.The latest figures indicate that the virus certainly hasn’t subsided within the city. According to Mr Hancock, the current seven-day infection rate now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people – down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was first announced. Progress, but as Mr Hancock added, there is “still a lot to do”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThere are some small comforts to look forward to, though. From 24 July, restrictions on some non-essential shops and early years childcare will be lifted, while those outside of the reduced lockdown boundary will be allowed to enjoy the freedoms currently available to the rest of the country.But for those caught inside the city’s hotspots, there’s no suggestion yet as to when restaurants, pubs and bars will reopen, leaving Leicester’s hospitality sector vulnerable to further economic damage and decay.“Many small businesses in Leicester are going to struggle to survive during this additional period of lockdown they certainly need additional help from the government,” Nigel Porter, the city’s only Liberal Democrat councillor, tells The Independent.However, he stressed that “putting the economy ahead of health” risked endangering the local population. “At the end of the day the priority has to be to get on top of the virus and until the number of positive cases in Leicester starts to drop the city will remain in lockdown.”While other local leaders have accepted that the city “cannot return to business as usual”, as Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe wrote on Twitter, Sir Peter Soulsby held few punches in his response to the government’s latest announcement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have left two areas in there – one that has a Liberal Democrat council, the other that has a Labour mayor.“The fact is they have focused in a way that is clearly party political and that’s not a way to deal with the virus.”The mayor’s comments have been met with a mixed reaction among locals, but they nonetheless point to a fraying relationship between Whitehall and Leicester City Council.Of course, Sir Peter is not alone in his criticism of the government. Kamlesh Khunti, a member of the Independent Sage board and a professor of vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, told The Independent that even now, after weeks of awareness around the city’s issues, local public health authorities are “still not getting data quickly enough”.“Local teams need to be more involved too,” he says. “This needs to be all localised. We know all the networks, the shopkeepers, the faith centres, we know the business community. These are the people who can influence what happens.“It has been a complete shock to us. We’re a proud city and this has not been good for anyone here. It’s not good for the community, for our businesses or our universities.”He said that although he was saddened by Thursday’s news, he was not necessarily surprised, explaining that an increase in targeted testing across the city’s most infected areas would be reflected in the statistics.“We will identify more patients if we continue doing more tests, especially in this high risk population. Worryingly this strategy may continue our city having high rates for quite a few weeks with disastrous consequences.“The high rates are not because people aren’t socially distancing - they’re all doing that has been asked of them over the last few weeks. This is why our local people are shocked, frustrated and angry.”Understandably, the continuation of lockdown is proving a tough pill to swallow for Leicester – especially compared to the soft-touch approach adopted by authorities in Blackburn with Darwen, where residents have been urged to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings after a recent spike in cases.“We were never given that opportunity,” says Jon Porter, a resident in Wigston, which has reported the second highest number of infections across all of Leicestershire.“Why wasn’t Leicester given that opportunity? Why weren’t we warned early on that Leicester is struggling? That was when we should have acted and introduce localised measures, like Blackburn. We weren’t told and now it’s too late.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.

However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Our social care system relies on many overseas workers, we should be welcoming them in not shutting them out.The new plans, promised for years since Britain voted to leave the EU back in , will see freedom of movement scrapped in favour of an Australian-style points-based scheme.Under the new system, foreign nationals applying to come to the UK for work purposes will have to meet certain criteria.It will assign points for specic skills, qualications, salaries or professions, and visas will only be awarded to those who gain enough points.The minimum requirements will include having a job offer from an approved sponsor that suits their skill level and being able to speak English. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Foreign nationals wishing to come to the UK for work purposes will need to score  points to successfully apply for an online “e-visa”.If an applicant meets the criteria of the minimum requirements, they will be awarded  points.But to score above this threshold they will have to meet other criteria based on salary, seeking to work in a sector with a recognised labour shortage or a having a PhD.While most will be expected to earn a minimum of £, a year, some such as lab technicians with prized skills will be able to come in with a salary as low as £,.To score  points, foreign nationals will need to be able to prove they have a job offer from an approved sponsor that is appropriate to their skill level.A further  points will be scoredthe job is in an occupation with a labour shortage such as engineering or information technology.While a university doctorate gives ten points with the figure rising to  pointsthe qualication is in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.Ten points will be awarded for an annual salary of £,, rising to  points over £,.A builders labourer who cannot speak English but has been offered a salary of £,, for instance, would only score  points and would be blocked from coming to the UK to work.Likewise, a skilled plumber with good English on £,-a -year, would also be awarded  points but denied access.But a primary school teacher offered an annual salary of £,, who also speaks good English, would score  points and would secure a visa to work in the UK.A university lecturer with a maths PhD with an offer of a £, would be awarded  points and would also secure a visa.It follows the points systems used in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Patel also announced the beefed-up measures for Border Force and immigration officials today.The Government revealed even criminals not sentenced to  months face being booted out of Britain.It said: Those already in the UK who are sentenced to  months or more in prison must be considered for deportation.Where the -month criminality deportation threshold is not met, a foreign criminal will still be considered for deportation where it is conducive to the public good, including where they have serious or persistent criminality.The change means criminals from the European Union are treated the same as currently happens to those from non-EU countries.Anyone deemed as a skilled worker - including postgraduate students - will still have the right to bring their families and children to the UK.Spouses, partners and children under  will still be eligible to come to the UK and stay.They can also have near full access to the UKs jobs market, and will be able to attend schools here.However, they will be made to pay the health surcharge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet, they will not need to wait much longer as casinos will join bowling alleys and ice skating rinks in reopening on August  in England.This came in Boris Johnsons latest easing of lockdown restrictions - but nightclubs and soft play areas will remain closed.Each facility must operate on strict guidelines which includes social distancing and proper hygiene to stop the spread of the virus.Players who visit the casinos must use hand sanitizer upon entering.Visitors of the casino will also be asked to enter the building one at a time.

These risks are reduced when outdoors, where surfaces may be subject to UV light and or rain.”Soft play areas could implement measures such as hand sanitiser stations, a one-way system around the soft play area, and protective screens at reception.The areas could also be deep cleaned with the use of electrostatic spray systems to prevent the virus lingering on surfaces.Visitor numbers may be limited to allow people to remain at a one metre distance from each other.On  June, Boris Johnson advised people to remain at least one metre apart with social distancing rule reduced from its original spec of remaining two metres apart.But when it comes to enclosed soft play areas, social distancing will be more dficult to measure in spaces such as balls pits and climbing areas.The frequent cleaning of these spaces could also be dficult.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When it came my son picked out one of the pastries which is his favourite.“He took his first bite and found something strange, hard and fleshy in his mouth. He immediately spat it out because this is not the type of thing you would expect to find in an esfiha.“When we inspected it, we were horried to discover the piece was the top of a human finger.“My son was ill when he realised what had been in his mouth and that he had nearly swallowed it. He is totally shaken up and is suffering nightmares after this appalling experience.”A team of health and safety experts from the Consumer Protection Institute visited the takeaway within hours and ordered it to close following its apparent failure to meet acceptable hygiene standards and safety conditions.The owner faces substantial fines for inadequate consumer standards along with criminal charges of culpable bodily injury and endangering the health and le of a minor and worker.The evidence has been collected by the Institute of Forensic Medicine and is being examined as part of the criminal proceedings. The teenager’s mum said her son will never eat another meat pastry again.The family has been advised to take legal action and seek compensation against the restaurant for risking the teenager’s health and endangering his mental stability.The injured chef was taken to hospital and has already been discharged with remedial treatment continuing at home.The bakery has been contacted for a response.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you say it, produce the facts”.Today, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the alleged interference unacceptable.He said: The Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.The Government said today:There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.Mr Corbyn responded to the claims in a Facebook post calling the docs genuine.He said: The documents we revealed during the general election about the danger of a Trump trade deal for our NHS were genuine - as is the threat of a £ million a week higher drugs bill.The Tories want to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support.Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes. Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.It came on the same day the UK was able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.I AM today updating Parliament on the ongoing investigations into the leak of the UK-US Free Trade Agreement documents ahead of the General Election in . The Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee has been briefed on the details of this incident.The Government has robust systems in place to protect the UK against foreign malign influence. These bring together government, civil society and private sector organisations to monitor and respond to interference, to ensure our democracy stays open, transparent and resilient. During the  General Election a cross-Government election security cell was stood up to coordinate responses to threats and hazards relating to the election.On the basis of extensive analysis, the Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit.

We fully support the recent action taken by our German partners who exposed Russian responsibility for the hack of their Parliament in  as well as their intention to act against those responsible under the cyber sanctions regime. The UK Government laid the statutory instrument for our own cyber sanctions regime on  June.The online forum Reddit confirmed the NHS leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.A statement from Reddit at the time said: We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK.We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.The Labour leader was branded a foolish pawn over the blunder.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverley blasted: Corbyn has some serious questions to answer.Is he a foolish pawn in a Russian disinformation campaign, or did he know where the leaked documents came from Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Labour were quick to pounce on the contents of the papers, claiming they revealed the plot against our NHS.Experts previously raised fears over the origin of the documents.Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at media analytics outfit Graphika, said: “It’s on the same set of websites, it’s using the same types of accounts and making the same language errors.It’s either the Russian operation or someone trying hard to look like it.”Ousted MP and Corbynite Laura Pidcock even got into a row with Skys Kay Burley over the documents, refusing five times to say whether the partys leaked NHS dossier came from Russia.The then shadow secretary of state for employment rights got into a spat with the journalistdays after Jeremy Corbyn claimed hed found evidence that the NHS would be up for sale in a series of papers.The original Reddit posting was uploaded on October  but was little known until Mr Corbyn unveiled it at a highly trailed campaign event.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things.

Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King.

But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength.

Then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her citizenship on national security grounds last February after Times journalist Anthony Lloyd found her, nine months pregnant, in Syria.She yesterday won a bombshell legal ruling to be allowed back to the UK to challenge her revoked British citizenship.She was seen shortly after wearing full black Islamic dress and burka in a refugee camp, her newborn baby having died.Upon herto Britain Begum is likely to be arrested and questioned, before facing trial on terror-related charges, reports the Mirror.The bombshell ruling could now open the door for  terrorists - including other ISIS brides and fighters - to make similar audacious bids toto Britain.And her brother-in-law and electrician Mohammed Rahman said last night he is stuck between a rock and a hard place.He said: She’s part of my extended family. I am not going to try and cause any rts between me and my brother.I’m very uncomfortable with the whole situation. I’m in between a rock and a hard place. I have my own opinions. I dont want to offend anyone.He added: I’m not very close with my brother’s we - I’ve met Shamima, but only at family s. There’s a big age dference between me and her anyway. That’s it.I have sympathy for her family. It’s a tough thing for a family to lose a child, but thats as far as I’ll go.I only found out she went to Syria on the news. I didn’t even know. They didn’t broach it with me. You take the hint.Senior judges said yesterday that Begum, who left aged , should be allowed toto the UK to challenge being denied her British citizenship.It is a bitter blow for the government who revoked her citizenship last year - sparking an appeal which has cost taxpayers more than £, so far.Begum and two pals – Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – ran away to Syria in February .Begum used her elder sister’s passport to flee with her Bethnal Green Academy friends.The trio flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria with the aid of smugglers.Within weeks of arriving, Shamima was married to Isis jihadi Yago Riedijk, , from Holland.They had two children who died from malnutrition and disease.The couple were separated as they fled Baghouz, the village where a few hundred Isis fighters were holed up in a desperate last stand.Shamima ended up in a Kurdish refugee camp where she gave birth to her third child.Eldest sister Renu revealed that her family had lost contact with her for the “longest time” until she was found by a Times journalist.One source said today: Why should anyone who leaves the UK to join ISIS then complain when they have their British passport taken away Shamima Begum made a conscious choice to go to a terrorist warzone, where she has now been stranded. Shes not able to appeal her case in person as a direct result. Many people will rightly ask, Wheres the unfairness in that The Court of Appeal ruled: Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed.But Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: The only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal.Begum was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in  to join ISIS.After initially marrying an ISIS fighter and sewing terrorists into suicide vests, she was found pregnant more than three years later in a Syrian refugee camp - but her baby boy died not long after being born.Figures show her lawyers have claimed £, in legal aid trying to win back her UK citizenship - but sources say the true public bill is at least double and tops £,.When she was discovered and stripped of her citizenship, her own dad slammed her choice to run away to join the terror group.Ahmed Ali said he was on the side of the government and condemned her lack of remorse before claiming he was misquoted.Now that she is able to leave the camp in Syria andto the UK to launch her appeal, it is likely the Government would struggle to send Begum back to a war-torn country - evenshe fails to get citizenship back.Sajid Javid warned: Most critically, allowing her and indeed other terrorists back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a real security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ersion of signicant resources.If Ms Begum does come to this country it will prove impossible to remove her.Following the ruling a Home Office spokesperson said: “This is a very disappointing decision by the Court. We will now apply for permission to appeal this judgement, and to stay its effects pending any onward appeal.“The Government’s top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.”Lord Justice Flaux ruled the national security concerns about her could be addressed and managedshe s to the United Kingdom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The crucial thing is that they are immune.The Oxford Uni study suggests the epidemiological limit to reach herd immunity may be greatly reduceda fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus.This is feasible, they add,people have inbuilt resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.The report says: Signicant reductions in expected mortality can also be seen in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection.Results suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave, the researchers add.It has been evident from the outset that the risk of severe disease and death from Covid- is not unormly distributed across all age classes.The bulk of deaths among the over  million cases reported worldwide are occurring among older age classes and those with [pre-existing conditions].“It is further becoming clear that risk of infection is also not unormly distributed across the population, the reports says.Scientists at Oxford point to those managing to fend off the virus as having high ing immunity.And,antibodies to the disease are built up in - per cent of the population, this is entirely compatible with local levels of immunity having approached or even exceeded the herd immunity threshold.In which case the risk and scale of resurgence is lower than currently perceived, say the researchers.Immunity to the bug has been hitting headlines for months, with Kings College research saying antibody responses to the killer bug “can be detected in most infected iniduals - days following the onset of Covid- symptoms”.It investigated samples from  coronavirus patients,  days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-.Worryingly, Kings Colleges study found that immunity to fight coronavirus might disappear only three months after infection.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in that situation, theres absolutely no reason I can see to change it.The measures come despite repeated warnings both in public and private from his scientic experts.Boris Johnson optimistically announced this morning Brits will be able to hug all their friends and family by Christmas.Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: More close contact between family and friends where we can.It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the restrictions and allow ato more normality by November, possibly in time for Christmas.However, the PM made clear that this was all conditional on our ability to defeat the virus.He cautiously told Brits eager to hug their family that we have a plan where we hope for the best and plan for the worst.The PM today handed councils powers for lightning lockdowns so they can shut pubs and cafés without going to Government first.The rules will allow town hall bosses to ban weddings and other gatherings at short notice.Boris explained:They will be able to close specic premises, shut public outdoor spaces and cancel events.These powers will enable local authorities to act more quickly in response to outbreaks where speed is paramount.Where justied by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors or types of premises in an area, introduce local stay-at-home orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the size of gatherings beyond the national defined rules or restrict transport systems serving local areas.Boris also gave the NHS an extra £billion so hospitals are “battle ready” for winter and can ensure a second wave is avoided.The PM also set a target of , tests a day by the end of October so flare-ups can be dealt with swtly.A PR blitz will now encourage Brits to get a virus test and promote walk-in testing sites.Leicester became the first city to go into a local lockdown, and now councils will have the power to swoop as soon as necessary where. Party goers and parents alike were also dealt a blow today as the Prime Minister has reiterated that nightclubs and soft play areas must remain closed.However, casinos, leisure centres and bowling alleys in England will be allowed to reopen in August.The NHS funding comes with fears growing over the virus running riot over the winter.Coronavirus thrives in the cold and spreads more easily indoors, with doctors concerned it could surge when flu is circulating.The extra billions will go towards keeping on the Nightingales and private hospital spaces.No  will also carry out a flurry of exercises to “stress test” their NHS winter plans.Boris announced the first lockdown measures back on March .Brits were told only to travelit was essential to do so for work.On May , Mr Johnson announced this was being relaxed and encouraged construction and manufacturing workers to head back to work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And those measures introduced on the fourth of July will also not apply, he added.It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to set out how he wants to see the economy and society slowly adapt back to some form of normality over the next three to six months.He will also flesh out the Governments whack-a-mole strategy, spelling out extra measures to stop outbreaks over the coming months.In Leicester, most schools have already broken up for the summer break.The measures would be reviewed again in two weeks to seemore progress has been made, and more rules can be relaxed.Mr Hancock also confirmed that some types of coronavirus swab tests would stop being used for the meantime as the Government assesses their safety.Some were not up to the usual high standards, the health secretary says - but stressed that there is no evidence of harm or impact on test results.The Health Secretary said: I hope these careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to the people of Leicester and Leciestershire.I say this directly to the people... I pay tribute to you. You have all shown respect for one another.I understand this hasnt been easy.There is still a lot to do and the public health messages remain critical.Please do not lose your resolve. The sooner we get this virus under control, the sooner we can restore le in Leicester.The city was the first in the UK to be put back into lockdown last month after a spike in cases.Testing centres swooped on the city and people were encouraged to stay home. Shops were shut up again and pubs and restaurants did not open on July  as in the rest of the country. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: As this data confirms, coronavirus cases in Leicester were signicantly higher than other parts of the country – and we took clear and decisive action to save lives.“We are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that these measures are only in place as long as is necessary, and we will set out the next steps by  July.”The Government has stressed that data has been provided to the Directors of Public Health throughout the incident.The lockdown currently covers the city of Leicester as well as surrounding areas including Birstall, Beaumont Leys, Glenfield and South Wigston. It has been suggested that families living in closer quarters, combined with a higher population of people whose English is a second language, may have contributed to the spike in cases.Workers in cramped clothing factories have also been blamed, with Police and the National Crime Agency investigating possible links to modern slavery.But Sir Peter told Sky News there is no evidence whatsoever to show coronavirus was being transmitted in clothing factories.Theres nothing in the data that suggests it is transmitting in places of work, he said.Mr Hancock revealed flare-ups are being swtly and silently dealt with.He said more than  local actions are being taken across the country each week.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC that data published on Saturday showed the city is really quite an outlier compared with anywhere  in the country.Prof Van-Tam told the BBC: The situation has improved but it needs to go further.He said that, while it would not be his decision to end the lockdown, doing so cant be rushed.Pressed on whether Leicesters lockdown is likely to be lted, Prof Van-Tam said: With any of these things, usually the way that one approaches them from a public health perspective is to take a phased approach.Normally you dont just go from having the brakes on heavily to just taking the brakes off completely.I think thats a reasonable expectation to set.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.The former Labour boss refused to answer questions from journalists outside his home in North London this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was asked by a journalist: Mr Corbyn, Do you have anything to say about Russian disruption  Were you complicit Did you help those who attacked our election, Mr Corbyn Mr Corbyn then shut the gate and said: Goodbye.The reporter continued: Do you have anything to say at all, Mr Corbyn, about whats happened today Do you regret whats happened Are you complicit with Russian interference in our elections, Mr Corbyn Would you do it again, Mr Corbyn Do you have anything to add about what happened, Mr Corbyn Do you regret your actions, Mr Corbyn, do you regret taking that document The ex-Labour leader then shut the door after wheeling his bike inside, followed with another goodbye to the reporter.The Government said today:The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes.Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.A senior Russian politician said today that allegations that Russia tried to meddle in the  General Election are anti-Russian nonsense which undermine UK-Russia relations and the UKs own authority.The Russian Foreign Ministry added: “The statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand it.If it’s inappropriate to say something then dont say it. If you say it, produce the facts”.The online forum Reddit confirmed the leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.It came as Vladimir Putins Russia was today blamed for being behind repeated cyber attacks to try and steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The UK has been able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.Heres what we know about the attacks:The National Cyber Security Centre have thrown every protection they have at Britains vaccination projects to keep them safe from attempts to steal information.British research projects are at the forefront of the effort to find a vaccine with scientists at Oxford University and Imperial University London leading the charge to prevent thousands more from dying.Britain is expected to publish a long-delayed report into Russian influence in British politics next week.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The firm has donated a total of £, to the party since April , according to the Electoral Commission. The most recent donation, of £, was made to the party in September . The firm has also employed Owen Paterson, a Tory MP and former minister, as an advisor since , and is paid £, a year. The Mirror understands red flags were raised about the aposCEapos safety stamps on the Chinese-made tests supplied by Randox. Physical inspection of the tests led to questions about the sterility of the swabs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Clinical advice is that thereaposs no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected, there is no evidence of any issues with our other test swabs and there is no impact on access to testing. In a statement issued yesterday, the Department of Health said: “As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, NHS Test and Trace are requesting that all settings pause the use of Randox test kits with immediate effect and until further notice.” Randox, which described its system as part of the “cornerstone of Government testing across the UK”, was awarded the contract in May as the Government was racing to meet its target of , tests per day. Grilling Mr Hancock in the House of Commons on Thursday evening, shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth questioned the awarding of the contract which he said was “given to Randox without any competitive tender”.  The firm, based in County Antrim, posted on its website in June: “Our test was adopted by the NHS and Public Health England and forms the cornerstone of Government testing across the UK. Using the Randox-patented Biochip Array Technology, the most-comprehensive multiplex PCR  on the market.” As a result of the recall of the kits, a number of testing sites have also been forced to suspend all activity until further notice. This afternoon Wirral Council announced that it had closed down the Bidston Coronavirus Testing Site near Birkenhead “for precautionary reasons, due to a safety recall issued by the Government on Randox test kits”. The Department for Health and Social Care said there wasnapost enough time to perform a full procurement contest because of the short notice in ramping up coronavirus testing.A spokesperson said:   “The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the Government and key partners.“In a matter of weeks we have engineered the largest ever expansion of British diagnostic capability - scaling up a nationwide network of drive-in testing sites, introducing home testing, deploying mobile testing units operated by Armed Forces personnel, building three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples, and more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus wedding receptions allowed august","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Wedding receptions to go ahead from August  - but only  guests allowedBoris Johnson set out a blueprint to further ease lockdown rules from next month - but said the government was planning for the worst in case of a second wave of the pandemicShareCommentsByLizzy Buchan:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsWedding receptions of up to  people will be able to resume in August\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In a major change to lockdown rules, the prime minister said receptions should go ahead from August , with leisure venues such as bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos could all reopen. Mr Johnson also scrapped government guidance on working from home, instead handing power to employers to decide whether it was safe to bring staff back. And people will be allowed to use public transport from Friday, ending the ban on non-essential travel on buses and trains. The prime minister said the government was planning for the worst ahead of the winter but said he believed the UK should also hope for the best.

The prime minister sparked a wave of anger when he announced plans to axe the Department for International Development in favour of a new “super department” last month, a move condemned by three former prime ministers.Cross-party MPs on the International Development Committee warned the “impulsive” merger could damage the UK’s status as a superpower and impact poorer countries already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.The UK is still legally committed to spending .% of national income on overseas aid, but Mr Johnson made it clear that cash spent fighting poverty in Africa could now be funnelled into Ukraine and the Western Balkans, where the UK has a strategic interest in battling Russia. The MPs said: It is perplexing that the decision to merge Dfid into the FCO was taken in the midst of the Covid- pandemic. The decision puts the international response to Covid- in jeopardy at a time when global cooperation is needed. It is the worldaposs poorest and most vulnerable who are likely to pay the greatest price. They urged Mr Johnson to continue to have a minister responsible for aid attend cabinet, along with a committee to scrutinise overseas spending. Labour ’s Sarah Champion, who chairs the committee, said it was “deeply disappointing” that the Government had failed to recognise the strengths of the department when it made the “impulsive move”.Now we are on the brink of this expertise being lost and our international reputation being damaged beyond repair,” she said. The fact that there was no consultation, seemingly no evidence as to why this is a good idea, really lets down the communities that UK aid is there to support.  Preet Gill, the Shadow International Development Secretary, said the report had published more damning evidence that the merger was done on a whim. It was taken with no consultation, no evidence and no plan, but it is not too late for him to change his mind, she said.Aid campaigners said the report raised further evidence that the move had been politically motivated amid speculation it came as part of Dominic Cummings ’ war on Whitehall.Oxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said: The committee is right - the demise of Dfid is likely to do real damage to the worldaposs poorest people and to Britainaposs international standing. British people expect our aid to be used for the benefit of those without clean water, medicines or food.

When she moved to the UK and set up home with her future husband, Meghan brought Guy with her, but left Bogart behind, with insiders saying it was because he was too old to fly. This was never confirmed by the Palace, however they said Bogart was living with friends, and explained that moving him to the UK would have lots of complexity to it. But now the Sussexes have ed to the US, many fans hoped Meghan would be able to be reunited with the Labrador-German shepherd cross - who she regularly gushed about in pre-royal interviews - but sadly that doesnapost seem to be the case.  An insider told the Sun : Meghan adored that dog but the decision not to take him back was based on Bogart’s relationship with Harry.Bogart never took to Harry when they spent time together in Canada. He didn’t like Harry. Meghan was very vocal about the fact it wouldn’t be fair to take him back full-time, given Bogart’s feelings for her husband. During September , Meghan and Harry adopted a new dog, Oz, who joined Guy in their Kensington Palace home. However Meghan hinted that people might have actually got the name wrong during an official engagement. During their first visit to Sussex  since being named Duke and Duchess of the county on their wedding day, Meghan and Harry popped into the Survivorsapos Network, a charity that supports victims sexual violence. They were presented with a framed picture of Meghanaposs beagle Guy. Harry then confirms they also have a new furry friend, saying: No oneaposs even seen our [new] dog, so thataposs amazing. Meghan then adds: I know, and they keep getting her name wrong.It has been widely reported that the couple named the new addition Oz, and many believe it was a nod to their  tour to Australia and New Zealand.Meghan is a huge animal lover, and has previously said the rescue dogs mean the absolute world to her and has referred to them as my loves and my boys.Both dogs regularly featured on her pre-royal  Instagram  account, and Meghan even shared a snap of Guy modelling a Union flag jumper.She often used the adoptdontshop hashtag in her Instagram posts.

The -year-old carer from Southend, Essex, claims the homegrown vegetables left her in agony after she ate them for the first time. Danielle Baxter said she became sick with vomiting and diarrhoea within hours of eating the roast vegetables. Sales of the seeds she used have now been suspended amid reports several families fell ill after eating the courgettes grown in their gardens.  She had reportedly planted Unwins seeds, and its parent company Westland this week has suspended sale of its courgette packets following complaints of sickness, reports The Sun. Danielle said: “I had a high temperature and I was vomiting and had diarrhoea. I phoned  after seeing online that courgettes can produce poison. “The paramedic told me to get checked out at AE straight away.  I didn’t start feeling better until five days later.” Courgettes, also called zucchini, can produce cucurbitacins — a chemical that causes nausea and stomach problemsit occurs in abnormally high volumes in the popular vegetable.

The horried housewe says she was horried to find the sullied parcel next to sanitised baby feed bottles. New mum Ellice Moran called the police after she found the package along with what she believes was a trail of bloodied fingerprints in the kitchen. The -year-old was playing with her newborn baby Grace at her Newcastle home when she heard the back door swing open. Assuming it was her partner Lewis on a break from work, she called out for him but got no reply. After being met with silence, she headed downstairs where to her horror she found an HM parcel on her kitchen worktop with fresh blood smeared over the packaging. Ellice said: Iaposve just had my first baby six weeks ago but due to social distancing nobody has really been able to see her so my mum ordered her some dresses from HM and got them delivered straight here. I wasnapost expecting the delivery. My partner went to work and I was in the house. I thought I heard him come back in for something because I heard footsteps around the kitchen and noise from the back door and the back gate. I shouted aposcan you get us a drink from the shopapos but I got no response which I thought was weird, I thought I was being ignored. I went down and he wasnapost there. I texted him and said aposhave you just been in apos He replied aposno.apos That was when I suddenly spotted the parcel on my kitchen bench sitting there next to my babyaposs feed bottles.  I was shocked to see that it had blood on it. The panicked mother-of-one began disinfecting the gate and the door of her home in Soulby Court, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She left the parcel for her gloved partner to move before she noticed the bloody fingerprints on her cupboard. I had to disinfect the whole kitchen because thataposs where I keep my babyaposs milk and tea cups. The cupboard where the bloodstain was is where Lewis keeps his wallet and money. Luckily itaposs just filled with baby Gaviscon at the minute.  I think the driver was being an opportunist. The fact the parcel had blood on it shows that he or she obviously wasnapost sanitising their hands before handling the parcels because they would have noticed their hand was bleeding because it would have stung. They werenapost in longer than a minute but they definitely did linger. I feel really panicky, I suffer from PTSD and anxiety anyway from not nice things that have happened in the past and so moving into my first home in January, that was scary for me. I was having panic attacks in the bathroom and couldnapost go in the shower unless someone  was in the house and then it just so happens the one day I leave the door slightly ajar because it was warm, someone lets themselves in.

Sophie Richardson who was looking forward to rebuilding her le after her le-changing surgery - but found herself back in hospital with the virus just four weeks after being discharged from a -week lockdown inpatient stay. The -year-old was admitted to Hull Royal Infirmary with a leg wound infection following a double amputation, where she underwent a test for Covid-. After the positive result, Sophie was immediately transferred onto a covid ward where her condition deteriorated.She is now on and off four litres of oxygen per day and described the pain as being like having someone sat on her chest, reports Hull Live. Her dedicated mum, Nikki Burton, , of Willerby said she wanted to warn people the virus has not gone away after the shock of her daughter contracting it whilst she has been isolating. She said: For those who think that Covid has passed and everything is back to normal, it is far from it.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereThis virus is still very active and amongst us all acting silently and discreetly. Covid does not discriminate. It is not fussy about what colour your skin is, whether youaposre rich or poor, what race or religion you are or the political views you hold. Covid isnapost particular and nobody is exempt. This is one thing where everybody is in the same boat! The scary thing is Sophie hasnapost travelled on public transport or been for a drink in the local pub. Neither has she been shopping, out for lunch or cuddled up to anyone. In fact she hasnapost ventured out in public at all and has been totally isolating from the outside world. Whilst rehabilitating at home after her double leg amputations, she has been shielding with carers who have been wearing face masks. They have been thorough with hygiene and hand sanitising but this virus has still managed to strike another victim. Sophie is now in a room on her own on a Covid ward in hospital whilst the nurses and doctors work extremely hard to try and win this new battle we face.Sophieaposs health problems began when she was  and studying for a PhD in Counter Terrorism at the University of Hull. She began to suffer with back problems which led to surgery in .Initially, Sophie was able to start physio - but six months later began having seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  She would often drop to the floor asher legs had been kicked out from beneath her and her knees would constantly dislocate causing excruciating pain. Having been backwards and forwards to hospital many times, in January this year it was decided Sophie could not live with the pain of the dislocations and a double amputation was necessary.The operation was then cancelled eight times due to coronavirus, but finally she was able to have the amputation in March, and following that was finally able to sit up for the first time in years.After ing home, Sophie went back into hospital for treatment for an infection in her wound and tested positive for Covid- before being transferred to the Covid ward. Her mum added: That’s whataposs scary, thataposs whataposs knocked me for six, itaposs more contagious than you think. Sophie hasn’t mixed with anyone. No one except for me and her same team of carers has been to see her because she’s isolating, she was shielding until the middle of July. I’ve been in but been a good more than two meter distance away. I’ve had a mask on and have socially distanced. Itaposs probably more airborne than what people are realising.

It is the first time that the monarch - who has been isolating since the start of the lockdown - has made a public engagement since March . She was seen in public for the first time since lockdown on June  when she attended a stripped back Trooping the Colour. Captain Tom, who turned  in April, raised nearly £million for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden. He will travel with members of his family for the rare, special investiture with the monarch. Royal investitures were put on hold during the pandemic, and those scheduled to take place at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in June and July were postponed. But the -year-old Queen, who has been staying at Windsor since before lockdown for her safety, will carry out the official engagement in person - rare for the monarch during the pandemic - to honour Captain Tom. It is her first public appearance since Commonwealth Day, when she stood alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in one of the coupleaposs last frontline royal engagements. The monarch will use the sword that belonged to her father, George VI, and will present him with the insignia of Knight Bachelor.  The ceremony will take place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. Members of the public are being asked not to attend Windsor town centre or gather in the hope of seeing any of the ceremony, which will not be visible from any external viewpoint. Captain Tom had set out to raise £,, but his incredible gesture won him fans around the world and saw his fundraising efforts soar. In honour of his incredible achievement, he was given a flypast on his th birthday.  Captain Tom also became the oldest person to ever score a UK Number One single with his rendition of Youaposll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices Of Care Choir. And his incredible efforts saw him awarded a special Pride Of Britain award. Captain Tom said the response to his charitable efforts had been outstanding. He said: Itaposs hard to describe thereaposs been so much kindness shown and so many people making kind remarks.

Mr Dewhurst said despite the highs today in the south, Scotland will be a mixture of sunny spells and showers, with temperatures likely around C. Through Friday evening, this band of rain slowly pushes its way southwards a bit further into parts of Wales - perhaps fringing the Midlands at times.  While Saturday will be a grey start in northern England and Wales, with a frontal system staying across the central swathe of the UK through the day, bringing cloud and rain despite some warm temperatures.

Niamh Hughes sobbed to her family donapost let them take me as she was jailed for more than three years. She appeared in court alongside friend Laura Albrektaite. The two girls launched their attack after their victim, Johnny Nath, threw Albrektaiteaposs shoes into the lake outside the popular Lakeside shopping centre as aposbanterapos.He was punched to the ground by a male friend of the two girls before they repeatedly kicked him in the head, Essex Live reports.Since the attack Mr Nath, has lost his sense of smell, canapost eat solid foods and is often askedhe has had a stroke due to the permanent damage caused. The attack was captured on CCTV and Hughes even took a photo of Mr Nath, lying on the ground and covered in his own blood, before leaving the scene. At a sentencing hearing at Basildon Crown Court on Tuesday, prosecuting barrister Cyrus Shroff told the court that rather than walking away, Albrektaite, who was  at the time, and Hughes, , started to kick him repeatedly in the head. When they eventually stopped their attack, Hughes ed and took an image of Mr Nath lying on the floor. When the girls were stopped by security, Albrektaite, of Shannon Way, Aveley, reportedly asked them to let her go as it could aposruin her leapos. The pair were both arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm at the scene, later pleading guilty.  Mr Nath canapost remember the chronology of events from the evening, the court was told. In a statement read out to the court, he said that he had been on a night out and was waiting for a friend to pick him up. The next thing he remembers is a friend standing over him saying that he needed to go to hospital. A security officer at Lakeside found Mr Nath lying on the floor with blood apospouringapos from his nose and mouth. In total, he suffered in excess of  facial fractures, including both eye sockets, his cheek bones, jaw and skull.  The court heard he has been left with blurred vision, ringing in his ears and he has lost his sense of smell and his jaw is misaligned. He said: I need this to stop. Itaposs dficult to live with. I have a lack of self confidence, I donapost like people near my face or looking at my face.  People askI have had a stroke. I hate the face I have, I donapost recognise it in the mirror. Mr Nath also described how he gets flashbacks of the attack and how he has been driven to drinking and smoking more than he used to. Both defendants and their families cried while watching CCTV of the attack. Representing Albrektaite, Michael Warren re-iterated that his client was just  at the time of the attack. He told Judge Lodge about domestic trouble in her le since she was young, however said that she accepted responsibility for what she did.  He said: She is going in to this term of punishment in the hope she can emerge better for it. She understands that she needs to suffer because of the events. She feels embarrassed for what she did to the victim and the long-standing impact this will have on her.

Instead under Vladimir Putin, Russia has become a rogue state, waging a new form of war against The West. It stands accused of undermining sovereign nations through cyber hacking, espionage and spreading misinformation. The charge sheet includes the Salisbury poisonings, interfering in the US elections, sabotaging a French TV station and cyber attacks on the German parliament. We can now add to that shameful list the targeting of UK institutions trying to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. The security services deserve credit for foiling this latest attack. Russia could have joined the effort to find a cure for Covid-. But no. It has tried to secure possibly ground-breaking research by cheating. Putin and his corrupt regime have made their country an international outcast.  Put her on trial Shamima Begum left this country to join a terrorist cult that gloated at the slaughter of her fellow Britons. It is easy to understand the anger at the court’s decision to allow her back to contest the stripping of her citizenship. The fact she has shown no remorse adds to the outrage. But, like it or not, Ms Begum is our responsibility. She was just  when she flew to Syria having been indoctrinated here. However grim her actions she should be tried in a UK court. That is how Britain can show it values fair justice, unlike the regime she championed.

But now sheaposs back on an even keel, she also wants to share the good times she still has with comping. Rebecca first caught the comping bug when she was strapped for cash but needed a buggy for her daughter. She said: I didnapost have many opportunities growing up - Iaposm from a single-parent household and quite a poor background. As a child Iaposd see things advertised on food wrappers and think aposwow, people can win cars and thingsapos. My comping started when my daughter was born in . I needed a stroller, so was entering every competition for buggies I could find - then I won one. I was home-schooling my boys then, and in the evenings I started entering competitions as a way of unwinding. Between  and , Rebecca, from Tonbridge, Kent, won a staggering £, worth of prizes - including about £, of holidays, along with smaller items like baby equipment, books, and cosmetics. But with the winning came a buzz, which Rebecca now says was helping with the lows of grief and post-natal depression, and the hobby began to grow out of hand. She said: I think thereaposs underlying stuff going on. I know in my case it was an issue with grief and loss that came to the fore around the same time and comping was my way of escaping that. When I lost my mum, which was some time ago, I kind of covered up the grief and I didnapost let myself grieve properly. I thought aposIaposm ok, Iaposll get through this, itaposll be okapos and I didnapost let myself have any grief. Then a when friend had a loss around the time I was into my comping I found it really hard to deal with because it brought back all of my memories of my own grief. Comping was the thing I went on to because I thought thataposs where I can get a happy feeling from winning something. Youaposre getting that little sense of validation and that little buzz and it became my way of getting through each day. My daughter was very young then and so I think there was some post-natal depression mixed in as well so I think thereaposs a whole loads of thing bubbling together which led to it becoming that extreme. At her lowest points, Rebecca was neglecting herself to chase the high - searching Facebook and competition websites.She said: It becomes a vicious circle. If you start getting wins, it can be hard to see a competition and not enter. I had a bad spell when Iaposd enter everything I could find on Facebook. The next night, Iaposd spend about five hours just going through the previous dayaposs competitions to check there was nothing Iaposd won and missed. At one point during her early comping years, Rebecca was winning a prize every day, on average but she confessed I was probably the unhappiest Iaposve ever been in my le. I was actually skipping showers, skipping meals, just to get in a few more competitions. It had become like a proper addiction. It feels wrong to compare it to alcohol or drug addiction because there arenapost the same physical consequences. But in terms of my mental health, it was my way of getting through the day. I was living for those little buzzes of those emails pinging in saying aposyouaposve won, youaposve wonapos. It was a really dficult time for me. Thankfully, Rebecca has bounced back. While she still plays and wins competitions regularly, she said she has now aposfound a balance.apos She said: I donapost gamble with money but its time I lose, its time with my family and time that I would be spending with my kids so Iaposm conscious of trying to keep that balance. Before it just became really dficult to switch off from the aposcompsapos knowing they were there. Now I just think the competitions are always going to be there, you might miss one or two or several hundred even but they will be there, there will be more competitions in the future, it doesnapost matter.  I have kind of got that sense of perspective again which at the time was really hard. Iaposm probably now doing half-an-hour to an hour a day, but it ies. Rebecca finds contests run by brands she follows on social media, and uses competition listing site The Prize Finder. She says her favourite competitions are creative ones, which take time and thought to enter. She said: The stand-out one for me was winning a Black Tower wine competition, to create a new bottle design. I just did a quick hand drawing, and it won. I loved seeing the bottles in supermarkets. I was so surprised to win - it shows itaposs always worth having a go. But creative entries like videos or building something out of cardboard can take days. When leaposs busy Iaposll just do form-fill entries, or ones where you tag friends. Some competitions are pure luck. At the beginning of this year I won a random draw for a £ cheque from White Stuff. Thereaposs something for everyone in this hobby. Rebecca and her family have enjoyed countless money-canapost-buy experiences, thanks to comping. She said: Last November we won an all-inclusive holiday to Mexico. It was just a lovely break. Back in  my husband won us a holiday to Dubai. It was so special. Theyaposve also won trips to places including Alton Towers, Center Parcs, and Wales. Before the pandemic, they had two stays in Cornwall and a holiday in Milan lined up - all competition prizes. Rebecca has even used comping as part of her sonsapos learning, during home-schooling.  She said: Iaposd find competitions for them to enter - like story-writing. My son loved to cook, and won a cookery competition where we got to have afternoon tea with Mary Berry. Rebecca dislikes the term professional comper, instead describing herself as a competition enthusiast. She said: You couldnapost earn a living out of it because you canapost guarantee whataposs coming. I know some people sell their prizes, but I only enter for things I need, orI know someone who needs it. Some people see comping as a very materialistic, grabby-grabby hobby where people are out to get what they can. Actually, most compers are really nice sharing people. AndI win something from a company and enjoy their product, I become a customer. But she has now written two books about her experiences.As a mum of a young daughter with juvenile arthritis, and having suffered with the condition since the age of  - Rebecca is using the money from book sales to fund Juvenile Arthritis Research, a charity founded by her and husband Richard."},{"url":null,"title":"inside apocalypse proof home can","story":"NewsInside apocalypse proof home that can withstand nuclear strike and keep out Covid-The epoxy-hardened concrete walls of the shelters are up to nine feet thick, and able to withstand critical, natural or man-made conditions, with engineer Larry Hall having transformed the complex into condos in ShareCommentsByAlexander GreensmithRyan Merrield:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video look-inside-doom-boom-bunker-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news inside-apocalypse-proof-home-can-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Chloe Lythgoe received an alert on her phone that a delivery was arriving, when she said she saw the driver walking up the path and smiling to himself. As she signed for the package, she realised the name of the X-rated sex toy inside was printed on the label - right next to the barcode the postal worker had to scan first. I opened the door and he handed it over, smirking ashe knew what was in the box, she sad. It was awful, I looked at him asto say aposplease, I hope youaposve not seen itapos and he looked back to say aposI know whataposs in thereapos. The -year-old ordered the £ adult toy from Amazon, with the product delivery details promising to make discretion aposa primary considerationapos. But Chloe, from Warrington, says she now feels aposmortiedapos every time she has to answer the door to face her postie. I went bright red, just closed the door and thought apostypical meapos, she said. I just wanted the ground to open up and eat me, it was less than discreet.  I opened the door in my dressing gown too with my kids stood behind me wondering who was at the door with my hair up in a aposmum bunapos - I bet I looked the part. I felt so embarrassed. Even now when he comes to the door I can’t look at him in the eye, just knowing he knows what I get up to makes me cringe. He still delivers all my parcels and every time I open the door I think aposoh why  Please changeapos. Iaposve got years of embarrassment to come.

Lizzie Pocklington, , and her boyfriend Martin, from Nottingham, had spent more than a month trying to decide which colour would look best on their front door.Like any diyer would, Lizzie painted a few potential shades in ying places on her door to see which she liked best, reported Nottingham Live. But thanks to their helpful postie, their decision was made for them. Clearly seeing the trouble the homeowners were having, the friendly woman posted them a note through their letterbox offering her suggestion on which colour they should pick. In the note, the postwoman says: Second green up from bottom of door looks the best followed by a smiley face.  But in the end Lizzie ended up going for her preferred choice - a warm mid-brown London Stone - just a few days before receiving the note and has already spent £ on the paint. Lizzie and Martin had locked horns a number of times about which colour they should choose. Whilst Martin favoured earthy green tones, Lizzie wanted a neutral colour. Lizzie, from Nottingham, said: My boyfriend came into the house and said there was a strange message left by the postie. I looked at it and just started howling because the postie had given us feedback because our door was painted with so many dferent colours. She said she liked the green - which annoyingly was my boyfriend’s favourite colour which is really gutting. And now I’ve put it on twitter everyone seems to agree with her - so I hope I made the right choice.  Lizzie said after the feedback she received online, sheaposs afraid to post the finished product, as everyone sided with the postwomanaposs choice. And said she can’t afford to pay another £ for a dferent paint pot anyway. She said: Eventually it was getting a bit ridiculous with how long it was taking us so we picked a colour, which was the one I liked. “Everyone online is saying I’ve made the wrong choice and she is a postie so she’s a door expert as she’s seen plenty. The postie and twitter all seem to think green is the colour to go with so I’m scared to post the finished product. I’m just hoping it looks nice now. I don’t want to disappoint the postie the next time she’s round and sees it’s not green. But the note made my day - it just cheered everyone up. Lizzie hopes to get in touch with her postie to show her all the messages she received online. She said: I’m hoping to get in touch with her so I’m going to print out all the lovely comments she got and leave it by the door so she can read them. She’s brilliant and everyone thinks so. It’s just nice to have such a wonderful person in the community. Lizzie’s boyfriend Martin said he felt asheaposd proved Lizzie right after pushing for green for months. The -year-old recruiter said: My reaction initially was that I thought the note was telling me to go pick up a parcel from a green door.

The passenger plane, filled with many people embarking on a holiday of a letime to Kuala Lumpar from Amsterdam, was shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile on July , . Flight MH was flying over Ukranian territory and a probe into the tragedy has said the Buk missile came from a military base in Russia. The report, carried out by the Dutch Safety Board and a Dutch-led investigation team, went on to claim the aircraft was downed in an area seized by Russian-backed rebels. Last year, four people were charged with murder in connection with the downed plane, and their trial began in their absence in March, . Russia has denied any involvement in the disaster. The Dutch government said earlier this plan that it plans to file a suit against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights six years on from the crash in Ukraine. A letter to parliament said the Netherlands was filing the case at the European court to achieve truth, justice and accountability for all the victims. Dutch Foreign minister Stef Blok said his government would give the court all its information on MH, thereby supporting the inidual applications already submitted by the victimsapos next of kin. Despite the new court case, the Dutch government said it wanted to continue the talks with Russia on MH that it started together with Australia over a year ago. Almost exactly a year after the atrocity an official report reveal the horrying details of MHaposs final flight. Only the captain and two of the crew were killed instantly when the missile hit the plane just three feet from the cockpit. Everyone  on board remained alive for up to  seconds before the plane exploded mid-air. Harrowingly, investigators even found one of the passengers wearing an oxygen mask amid the wreckage of the plane, meaning they had time to put it on before they were killed. The findings of the official report, compiled by the Dutch Safety Board, devastated the loved ones of those who died. They had hoped theyaposd been killed instantly. Instead, most died due to “decompression, reduced oxygen levels, extreme cold, powerful airflow and flying objects. The report added: “It cannot be ruled out that some occupants remained conscious during the  to  seconds before the plane crashed. Victims were barely able to comprehend the situation in which they found themselves...no indications were found of any conscious actions such as sending text messages.” Claudio Villaca-Vanetta, had been told husband Glenn Thomas, of Blackpool, died “instantly or very quickly”.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out. It has been a long time coming for me because it was my first game since January but it was good to get out there and going again.“It was exciting to be back playing again.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

I dont think that we all necessarily want to wear secondhand clothes ndash I mean, I love finding a secondhand bargain somewhere its something I spend a lot of time doing ndash but a lot of people dont like that idea and the important thing is not that you wear clothes that somebody  has owned before but that the fabrics are recycled and we look at how a circular economy works in fashion.\"Ms Shulman believes very strongly that the drive for more sustainable fashion must come from the brands themselves.\"It has to be driven by the brands, the people making the clothes,\" she says.\"Theres a much harsher environment now for people who arent watching out for good practice.\"And that will extend to the production of the clothes but its not yet at a point where you have to prove that youve got a sustainable pipeline.,params: .push\"And, at the end of the day, a big driver for people is what they can afford.\"But, of course, its not only fashion fans but also book lovers who will be drawn to see Ms Shulman speak, and she talks just as passionately of her childhood love of reading as she does her favourite Chanel jackets.\"I loved reading, as a child. Loved it. I used to love Kay Thompsons Eloise.\"Eloise is a child who is brought up in the Plaza Hotel in New York, and she kind of wreaks havoc, going up and down escalators and letting her pet turtle skedaddle around the corridors. That was one of my favourite books.\"And Emil  The DetectivesI loved, as well.\"And all the schoolgirl books, like Mallory Towers... heavenly!\"If you thought the last thing Ms Shulman would have done while running one of the worlds most successful magazines was read books, she insists its important to make time for such a pursuit.\"I always used to say to people who said to me, I dont know how you have time to read, I dont have any time to read ndash you do have time to read, you just dont choose to use your time reading.\"If you really wanted to read, thats what youd do with your time.\"She adds: \"I read a lot ndash I squeeze it in. This week Ive only read for a couple of hours but when I have got some time that isnt allocated to something , I will read.\"If you choose to make time to read Clothes..., youll be rewarded by a nostalgic travel through Ms Shulmans wardrobe timeline, interspersed with thoughts on the relationship between fashion and identity.\"I went through notebooks, diaries and photograph albums to try to dig up the feelings and the memories about certain clothes,\" she says, \"but it wasnt totally nostalgic because I spent quite a lot of time also reading up about the history of ious objects and doing research so it wasnt just about myclothes.\"Its not a book that dishes about the famous people I met at Vogue.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Matt Hunt, the CEO of Free The Bears, who is in the programme, I met him when I lived in Australia in  and we started a friendship and have grown stronger ever since. And probably up until  when I took the position, every year for the last six to eight years he must have sent me a job description or a position opening, trying to encourage me to work with or do something for Free The Bears.I was just never in the position in le where it was manageable or achievable until last year - and then I was incredibly lucky, incredibly fortunate in my sort of personal position, that I could effectively take  months out and not get paid very much at all, and go and work for Free The Bears and Matt.HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE EXPERIENCE It was one of the most incredible, uplting, and yet challenging periods in my le. I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Hurrah  The pubs are reopening     here  39 s why I love even the worst of them","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple.

What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar. I remember joining him there one evening, when two women arrived and asked for two white wines. ldquoSmall, medium or large  asked the impeccably polite bartender. ldquoBottles, they replied.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

At the very least, Mr Gove should make sure that the nations and regions are properly represented on the new regulatory body.Further, on the new points-based immigration scheme outlined this week, there is a strong case for Scotland to be allowed to award extra points for certain occupations ndash like care work ndash where there is an unavoidable shortage. Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

From my involvement I can confidently state that the one constant in this situation has been the rapidity by which the volume and quality of data relating to the virus has increased and knowledge and understanding of its impact has informed the need to adapt our response to reflect this.At the outset each country took its own stance relative to the scientic evidence available at the time. Inevitably this stance was clearly informed by politics and we can see the results of that by a comparison, albeit simplistic, between, for example, New Zealand and the United States.The situation in which we now find ourselves across the UK reflects this. At the outset the available science within the UK led the Westminster and the devolved governments to the same starting point. However, as the scientic evidence grew, Westminster chose one path while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took a dferent approach which reflected the same principles as those countries throughout the world who sought to eliminate rather than contain the virus.The evidence now clearly suggests this path has been the more circumspect, while only time will tell whether it proves to be wholly successful. What is clear, however, is that the actions of the devolved governments have been taken based around a structured and strategic response to evidence rather than, as appears to be the case, a series of ill-considered reactions to prevailing political dynamics that seems to characterise the Westminster administration.It has also been the case that far from relying on \"common sense\" as promoted by the politicians, those tasked with ing the athletes to training have been extremely prescriptive about what constitutes good, and safe practice leaving no room for doubt as to what is required. While that may appear to be dictatorial and imposing on an iniduals freedom, in reality one inidual not complying with protocols can have a serious effect on everyone  around them.These are unprecedented times, calling for clarity and effective governance.

Nationalists came closer, much closer, than unionists like to admit to victory in the  independence referendum. Far from accepting that defeat, support for independence has grown steadily from that  percent base to at least a dead heat.And, although I think it is risky for nationalists to invest too much stock in any polling conducted during an unprecedented crisis such as coronavirus, there is little doubt that, in this snapshot in time, nationalists are winning. Even No voters think that Nicola Sturgeon is doing a good job.Scottish nationalism is in the jaws of victory. So why, three times in the last week alone, have dferent parts of the movement taken steps which risk snatching defeat Victory for nationalists is not a complicated route to chart. It has three elements: win a majority based on a clear manesto commitment at a Scottish Parliamentary election obtain agreement from the UK Government to allow a referendum to be held persuade enough  No voters to vote Yes.So the question for nationalists, it seems to me, should be lsquodoes what I am doing make any of these elements more or less likely to happen rsquo. If we look at the output from the nationalist community over the last week, the answer has to be lsquoless likelyrsquo.Let us take it in turn. The creation of another pro-independence party ndash the Alliance for Independence or AFI ndash has been discussed for some time amongst those seen as agitators against Ms Sturgeon. They are, very broadly speaking, more fundamentalist about the route towards a second referendum and independence, set against the gradualist and more consensual approach of the SNP.On the face of it, AFI is a clever concept, exploiting the SNPrsquos strength in constituencies, peeling off the wasted SNP regional votes, and scooping up a large proportion of the  regional seats.The legitimacy or otherwise of lsquoplayingrsquo the Additional Member Systemvoting method is for another column, but as an exercise in maximising the number of seats for pro-independence parties the AFI proposal has solid logic.However, this is not solely about electoral success in May. The entire purpose of the exercise is, I presume, to lay the foundation for a second independence referendum. However, without the consent of Westminster, nationalist parties could win  seats and there will still not be a second referendum.There remains a debate in the Conservative party about the granting of indyref. The official line remains that there will not be one. Wersquove had one, we said no, we meant it, you said ldquoonce in a letime and so on and so on.

On the fringes of the nationalist movement, yes, but nonetheless attracting national publicity. The  percent who voted No last time have, by definition, at least some affinity with the Union, and with England. It may be social, cultural, economic it doesnrsquot matter what it is, it matters that it is there. Irsquod place a bet that precisely none of the two million people who voted No in  will be persuaded by the Hazmat brigade. Indeed, it has more chance of pushing Yes voters the other way.Similarly, the decision by AUOB, a more mainstream nationalist group, betrays a lack of understanding of who lsquosoftrsquo Unionists are, and what they think.The -or-so percent of voters who might go either waythere is another referendum are, self-evidently, moderate, pragmatic, and unbiased. Their choice is likely to be clinical rather than emotional. They probably voted No last time because they felt the nationalist arguments on the economy were too weak, too left-wing.Tell me, then, how a march of thousands of highly committed, flag-waving leftist nationalists is going to persuade the persuadables If I were a nationalist, looking to achieve independence forthwith, Irsquod be sticking by the SNP strategy.

The campaign was dubbed Whisky for Water.The team of experts who blended the whisky was led by writer, Whiskeria reviewer and star of lsquoThe Angelsrsquo Sharersquo, Charles MacLean, and includes Whyte  Mackay master blender Richard Paterson.Each bottle contains a small amount of whisky, which accompanied the boys during their -day row from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Antigua in the Caribbean in the Atlantic Campaigns Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge.Just  bottles of MacLeanrsquos Pillage, a blended Malt, and  bottles of MacLeanrsquos Spillage, a blended Scotch, will be available. Additional  x cl miniatures of will also be released, sold via Edinburgh retailer Royal Mile Whiskies.Youngest Lachlan traveled to Madagascar two years ago where he saw for himself the real dference Feedback Madagascar was making to communities.He said: ldquoThe experience of making the whisky gave us a real insight into Dadrsquos world. Itrsquos no wonder people across the world are so enchanted by the flavours and stories behind Scotch whisky. The overwhelming generosity of the  West Coast distilleries which donated to our cause is a credit to the entire industry.ldquoEvery dram will save lives whisky is quite literally being turned into clean water.He added: ldquoWe know better than anyone how high Dadrsquos standards are, and hersquos very proud of this whisky. Ever since we sat down with Feedback Madagascar and dreamed up the lsquoWhisky for Waterrsquo campaign, wersquove been overwhelmed by the generosity of people from Scotland and beyond and wersquove loved every minute of working with our Dad to hopefully make even more of a dference.The whisky has been a year in the making and was collected during Broarrsquos first training run.Charles, who missed greeting the boys on the arrival from their world record-breaking row because they were more than five days quicker than anticipated, said: ldquoWhat a blender is trying to do is make something that is more than the sum of its parts. To my knowledge, this is the first time that all the distilleries on the west coast have collaborated and wersquove tried to balance the personalities of the dferent whiskies to create two unique, attractive and very rare blends.ldquoThis whole adventure - helping my boys get organised for the row, watching them break three world records and working with them to create these whiskies - has been a le-changing experience for them, and for me. Irsquom incredibly proud of them.The MacLean boys overcame seasickness, battery issues, storms, dehydration and exhaustion to reach Antigua in just  days. With their efforts, theyrsquove already raised more than pound, to be split between Scottish childrenrsquos charity, Childrenrsquos st, and Feedback Madagascar.These whiskies should raise almost poundk, which would allow Feedback Madagascar to build at least  new Broar holes.Jamie Spencer OBE, Managing Director of the Argyll-based charity, said: ldquoThe vast majority of the rural population of Madagascar doesnrsquot have access to clean water, and dirty water is a killer. In this instance whisky really is lsquothe water of lersquo - especially under the deadly shadow of Covid-. Broarrsquos inspiring efforts and every bottle bought will transform peoplesrsquo lives forever.Arthur Motley, purchasing and sales director at Royal Mile Whiskies, added: ldquoNot only is this the first blending project of one of the most respected names in Scottish whisky and a limited edition, but all the proceeds will go to charity. Given those factors and the exquisite taste of both whiskies, we think the bottles could sell out within hours."},{"url":null,"title":"can-scottish-government-urge-us-back-cars-sake-environment","story":"For all my boring on about the importance of cycling, for the environment and good physical and mental health, I love Stella the Micra. Weve been together for  years and, oh, the things we have seen, the places we have been.Shes due an MOT soon, I mention to my mum. \"That might be her last,\" she replies. I pat at Stellas air vent, as though it were an ear, so she doesnt hear. Ma Stewart softens and suggests I could keep Stella parked in her driveway, I wouldnt have to trade her in, nothing so brutal.But the thing about Stella is, she may be an old girl of  but she only has about , miles on the clock because, while I love her like a sister , I do practice what I preach. I do go on public transport as much as possible. I do ride my bike everywhere I can.We take a trip to Doncaster once a year to visit our friend Stephanie and we drive to Coatbridge from Glasgow every second week. Other than that, she largely sits in the carpark patiently waiting a next outing.I used to take the train to Doncaster every year, incidentally, until the fares went up wildly. For several years you could get aticket for about pound but then it became cheaper to fly to Europe than to rail southwards, so it was Stella to the rescue.Wed get lost every year, usually going awry somewhere around Scotch corner. One year I was delighted to find a practical application for my English Lit degree. Entirely lost, I stopped at a service station and clocked a red rose above the entrance. A rose  War of the Roses! Red  Bloody hell, Im in Lancaster. Wrong side of the country entirely and thank you Shakespeare.During the coronavirus, however, Stella has never been busier. When le started to slow down but we were still commuting in to the office, I started to drive to work every day due to, at first, a fear of coming in to close contact with people on the bus, and then due to reduced services.The bike was parked because I was having to carry a load of equipment back and forth, for boring reasons, and it was too heavy and didnt fit in my panniers. Friends who were still commuting did likewise, dropping public transport for the private car.While very much staying at home for the vast majority of the time, very rare trips that would normally be done on public transport have been done by car. Again, reduced services and reluctance to be close to strangers.As lockdown has eased, the car has become a focal point for allowing a slightto some normality. First it was drive thru food and drink outlets. Whereas you might previously have sat in, now driving through was the only option.Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils have now reintroduced parking charges, in an attempt to ease congestion and get back on track with carbon emission reduction aims while encouraging greener travel.This is the right thing to do, though it makes it tricky for workers while public transport is still reduced. It also reintroduces the conumdrum of how to encourage people to use our city centres and local high streets now that out-of-town shopping malls with their ample and free parking have reopened.Its not only commuting, shopping and dining that have become car-centric.Ato social and leisure activities is focusing on private vehicles too. There are drive-in comedy shows planned, drive-in movies and a drive-in gig - though this was cancelled due to concerns about localised lockdown restrictions.Its straightforward enough - being in a private vehicle is the most socially distanced place you can be while still enjoying pre-pandemic pursuits.Glasgows plans for a low emission zone in the city centre had made me start to think about what to do with my car. Is it more environmentally friendly to keep a relatively low emissions vehicle or to buy, say, an electric car but have that offset with the emissions generated producing it I hadnt started to look into that yet but had planned to, as well as trying to work outI could manage without the car and join a car club instead.Yet being in an emergency situation has turned all that on its head and made owning a vehicle, once again, the most attractive option, especially with the added boon of the tourism sector opening this week and the five mile travel limit lted.The oft repeated sticking point when pushing for increased levels of active travel has been the suboptimal public transport were faced with.Now, theres really no defence for public transport because its unarguably reduced. It wasnt good enough or joined up enough before, and now there is less of it.Our environmental concerns havent diminished during the Covid- pandemic, they are very much still there and very much in need of relentless, persistent addressing.Its now a bigger ask than ever before to urge people to embrace greener travel, an ask the transport minister made earlier this week. Reflecting on phase three of lockdown being the most dficult transition phase yet, Michael Matheson said, \"The obvious temptation for households with access to a car will be to take that option. However, we know many journeys are less than a few miles and could be covered via active travel, especially over the summer and autumn months.\"Using a car, though, isnt merely a temptation now. Its a common sense, understandable option for many. With a reduction in public transport and so many new car-based activities on offer, there are real additional issues of inequality for those households without a vehicle.The surge of people cycling in lockdown for leisure will, hopefully, be sustained and see those who are biking for exercise start commuting too.Id count myself as an active travel advocate but Im certainly going to have to wean myself back off driving as we move through the pandemic response. Car use is now predicted to rise to % of pre-covid levels. We dont want it any higher. Before lockdown there was so much will towards active travel - we need to be taking great strides towards that again.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It will be the Arab worlds first interplanetary mission.Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, when it had water sources that may have supported tiny le forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.So far, the US has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times.Two Nasa landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit - three US, two European and one from India.Chinas last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in . The Chinese space programmes close military connections and the relative secrecy within which it operates has limited its opportunities for co-operation with those of the US and other countries.Meanwhile, Chinas foreign ministry has said it is not seeking to confront or replace the US as the worlds top technological power but will fight back against \"malicious slander\" and attacks from Washington.Hua Chunying responded on Friday to a series of recent accusations from the Trump administration.She said Chinas chief concern is improving the livelihoods of its citizens and maintaining global peace and stability, despite what critics say is an increasingly aggressive foreign policy.\"As an independent sovereign state, China has the right to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, to defend the achievements made by the Chinese people with hard work, to refuse any bullying and injustice against China and to fight back against malicious slander and attacks by the US against China,\" Ms Hua told reporters at a daily briefing.Her comments came in response to a speech on Thursday by US Attorney General William Barr in which he cautioned American business leaders against promoting policies favourable to Beijing.He said at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic China not only dominated the market on protective equipment, exposing American dependence on Beijing, but also hoarded supplies and blocked producers from exporting them to countries in need.Mr Barr also accused hackers linked to the Chinese Government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to coronavirus vaccine development.He levelled the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia.Numerous allies of US President Donald Trump have issued strongly worded messages over China in recent days, coming at a time when bilateral relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from accusations of technology theft to Chinas claims in the South China Sea.Ms Hua dismissed Barrs accusations of cyber theft related to vaccine development as \"absurd\".\"Because everyone knows that China is in a leading position in the research and development of new coronavirus vaccines, we have first-class scientic research personnel, and we do not need to gain a leading position with theft,\" she said.Chinese companies have moved swtly to develop a coronavirus vaccine as countries compete for the prestige and profits that would come with being the first to bring such a product to market."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmFirefighters were called out to Kirkwall Grammar School, last night, Thursday, for what turned out to be a  alarm.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online. Businesses across the UK are assessed according to their respective national guidance including the social distancing and cleanliness protocols that must be in place. vw, px\"  For more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The next census had been due to take place in .Scottish secretary for economy, fair Work and culture, Fiona Hyslop, said: #COVID- is the biggest single public health challenge facing us in more than  years and as in many other areas of le, the ongoing disruption is impacting on the vital preparations for the census.“Following careful consideration and on recommendation of National Records of Scotland , ministers have informed the Scottish Parliament of their intention to move Scotland’s Census date to March . This reflects the unprecedented impact which COVID- is having across a wide range of sectors.“We recognise Scotland’s Census remains more relevant than ever in the current climate, as it allows important planning decisions to be made informed by the make-up of Scotland’s population.“This decision was not taken lightly. However the quality of the census data must remain robust, and by moving to  National Records of Scotland can continue to deliver a census which ensures the highest possible response rate from people across Scotland, to allow government, local authorities and key services plan for every element of public le, from building homes to NHS support.“NRS will continue to work closely with stakeholders and partners to ensure that appropriate data is available to support work that was expecting to make use of Census  data, particularly for key funding allocations and policy decisions.”Paul Lowe, registrar general and chief executive of NRS, added: “The priority and responsibility of NRS is to put in place a census that enables everyone across Scotland to participate, so that information collected can be used to produce the analyses and deliver the benefits required by the people of Scotland.“The census is a unique count of every household in Scotland and in the next census, for the first time, the majority of people will be encouraged to complete their questionnaire online. This will require a signicant field force and face-to-face engagement in an effort to support digital participation, engage with the public and raise awareness of census across the population.“The census is a major logistical operation and the twelve months running up to a census are vital in planning and testing the effectiveness and security of systems and processes. COVID- restrictions have delayed or prevented many of these key activities, including engagement with key organisations, from taking place over recent months.“This is the right decision for Scotland which will allow us to undertake a high quality and safe census in  that will produce the rich data we need for many years to come.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Mr Hancock told the Commons there had been a problem with swabs, but there was no suggestion test results were affected.Mr Hancock told MPs: We#ve identied some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we#ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.And while we investigate further, we#re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits are paused in all settings until further notice.Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.There is no evidence of issues with any of our other test swabs, and there is no impact on access to testing.Shadow secretary of state for health John Ashworth asked Mr Hancock what was wrong with the Randox test kits - and how many had been used.Is there a health risk to anyone who has been tested with these kits  the senior Labour MP said.And how many people have these unsafe kits been used on and why weren#t the certications checked before these kits were used These kits tend to be used in many care homes.We want care home residents to be tested regularly, we want care home staff to be tested regularly - can he guarantee that those care homes will now get alternative kits rapidly Mr Hancock replied: The reason is that they had a CE stamp and upon investigation of the certication of that stamp, the certication was not forthcoming, and therefore physical checks were done and we found that the swabs weren#t up to the standards that we expect.This is limited to the Randox element of the testing system, not the broader testing system that we have.And I explained the clinical position, which is that there is no evidence of any harm having been done and that there is full access to testing because we have plenty of other test kits available.A statement on the Randox website said: As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batch supplier of swabs.This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business, which uses a dferent supplier of swabs.Test results from Randox kits are not affected.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Unmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeGrave of murdered Warren Crossan vandalised in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The offences each carry a maximum penalty of up to  years imprisonment.The respondent had booked  international flights into or out of the UK between May ,  and May , . On  occasions, the outward andflights were within a matter of hours. The European Arrest Warrantstated that Mr Adams was stopped at Belfast International by Border Force officers on May ,  travelling with only hand luggage. The warrant said Mr Adams confirmed to Border Force officers that he had packed the bag himself.When asked whether anyone had given him anything to take out of the country, he replied: Yes, €,.The warrant stated that Mr Adams was interviewed under caution on May ,  and made no comment to questions asked in relation to the cash, his personal background, his employment status and financial position. Counsel for the State, Aoe Carroll BL, previously made an application to the court for Mr Adams# surrender and asked the court to let the chips fall where they may. She submitted that the respondent#s objections to surrender were speculative, vague, unsupported by evidence and were subject to innumerable iables so that the court could not refuse surrender on foot of same. Ms Carroll said she was satisfied surrender to the UK would not give rise to an unfair trial. She said nothing in the warrant was defective, nothing arose in relation to Brexit as the status quo remains in place, so surrender was not prohibited.Furthermore, Ms Carroll said thatan order for surrender was made against Mr Adams, she would be asking the court to postpone handing him over to the authorities in Northern Ireland until domestic proceedings had been determined.The court has heard that the respondent#s position was complicated by the fact that he has been ed for trial before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on separate money laundering charges, and his trial is due to take place in Dublin in June . Mr Adams had contested his surrender at the High Court, with his lawyers saying that he should not be extradited to Northern Ireland due to Brexit. Counsel for Mr Adams, Paul Comiskey O#Keeffe BL, had argued thathis client was convicted and sentenced in the Republic first, there would be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial in Northern Ireland in the future.He claimed this is because the UK would no longer be in the transitional period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union. He further submitted that there was a real risk that the fundamental rights of the respondent would not be respected. Ordering his surrender to the UK yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Burns said he was satisfied that the extradition of Mr Adams was not prohibited by part three of the European Arrest Warrant Act . In light of the domestic offences brought against Mr Adams, the judge postponed his surrender to the UK until a later date.He remanded him in custody until July , .

After the club announced its formation it was inundated with interest.East Belfast men#s side faces St Michael#s Magheralin today, with the ladies# team taking on Saval tomorrow.The new club has rekindled memories of former club St Colmcille#s which really lit the GAA torch in the east of the city.St Colmcille#s was initially founded in the Ballyhackamore area in the late s before going out of existence in the s, only to resurface in the s in the wake of Down#s All-Ireland winning feats in  and .

My kids love coconut and white chocolate and my wee girl has Rice Krispies every day for breakfast. And I just thought Cadbury#s don#t really have a bar that has coconut in it, she explained.It was also a case of second time lucky for the BT telecoms employee. She previously entered her recipe idea, but was not selected.The first time I had entered the same bar and never heard anything, until I got an email to say I hadn#t been chosen. But I thought I#m going to enter that again. So probably last August I picked the three same flavours, she recalled.Then last September or October I got an email from Cadbury#s to say that I was down to the final . I just thought: #Is this a joke #The -year-old said she was shocked and delighted to then learn she had been selected as one of the three finalists who would travel to England to pay a visit to Cadbury#s headquarters in Bournville and witness their recipes being made into chocolate bars.I just couldn#t believe it. The smell of chocolate when you get in there... it just hits you. It#s amazing! I met the team and the other finalists. I had a brilliant wee day, she said.Going up against Gillian#s Coconutty is #Out of the Blueberry#, which has blueberry flavoured nuggets and white chocolate-coated cereal balls, and #Crunchy Honeycomb#, a mix of milk chocolate and caramel flavoured fudge cubes, chopped hazelnuts and honeycomb pieces.Gillian said she loved popping into the supermarket to see the bar on sale for the first time. It#s very exciting. Already I#ve had loads of people tagging me on Facebook, saying that they can#t wait to try the bar, or they#ve already tried and loved it, she added.Having tried it, I recommend taking a couple of bites, that way you get the full impact of the coconut.The chocolate bars are exclusive to buy in Tesco until July , when they go on sale at other retailers. At that stage, added Gillian, three mystery celebrities will champion each of the flavours online. I did get a buzz seeing it on the display, she said. The kids are over the Moon, saying: #Are you famous now, mummy  And I say: #I wouldn#t go that far, but everyone knows my signature now#.The overall winner will be decided by a public vote at www.cadburyinventor, which accounts for % of the vote, with the remaining % split between other online polls and sales. The winning bar will be on shelves as a permanent product at the start of . xxx  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Unmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeGrave of murdered Warren Crossan vandalised in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During his first visit to Belfast as Taoiseach, Mr Martin met with the First and Deputy First Ministers in Stormont Castle, as well as the leaders of the smaller parties.Despite renewed tension between the DUP and Sinn Fein over the Bobby Storey funeral, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill appeared together for a picture with Mr Martin on his arrival.Speaking afterwards, he said the wide-ranging discussions focused on suppressing any spikes in Covid- and minimising economic disruption caused by Brexit.He quickly side-stepped a question on how the First and Deputy First Ministers could reconcile, saying: I would never attempt to advise others in terms of relationship-building, but I think we had a very good, warm meeting today. Stressing the need for all-Ireland cooperation, Mr Martin said the Good Friday Agreement would remain the defining blueprint in a post-Brexit world.Given the enormous change that is taking place, there is a need to do some signicant work together in terms of... how we share the island in peace and in harmony, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin sitting down with the First and Deputy First MinistersThe Taoiseach said he was delighted that the first North-South Ministerial Council in three years will take place at the end of the month following the Stormont deadlock and disruption caused by Covid-.The body cooperates on areas such as the environment and waterways.Overall, I#m very encouraged by the meetings I#ve had... a genuine desire on all sides to work together in a pragmatic way to the mutual benefit of all the people of dferent traditions on this island, he said.After years of strongly criticising Sinn Fein as Fianna Fail leader, Mr Martin was askedhe would now soften his approach in his new role.My views on Sinn Fein are well-known, I#ve articulated them as a party leader... but as Taoiseach one has to be very conscious of the objective of the country, he said.He also played down any concerns over the dferent pace of lockdown on both sides of the border.Let#s be fair to both administrations, Covid- has been suppressed to a signicant degree, he said.That said, in the Republic over the last week or two we#ve had an increase in numbers, which the health officials are worried about.He added: All of us are very fearful of a second surge in the autumn, we#re very anxious to get the schools back and to deal with the non-Covid strand of medicine.Mrs Foster said she told the Taoiseach she looked forward to a positive dialogue during his tenure based on mutual respect for both jurisdictions and understanding each other#s dferences.Recovering from coronavirus had been the main focus of the meeting, she said, and working to rebuild both economies and protect public health. Mrs O#Neill called on Mr Martin to honour commitments made by the Irish Government in the New Decade, New Approach deal.I look forward to working on a north-south basis to ensure those crucial funding and practical commitments are fulfilled as soon as possible, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont Hotel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMicheal Martin removing his face mask as he prepares to meet party leaders at the Stormont HotelShe also backed recent calls to increase the use of mandatory face coverings in public. The Chief Medical Officer has made it very clear that while perhaps at one stage of this pandemic he was not convinced of the merits of face coverings, we are now in a space where he thinks that is the case.We will look at all of that evidence and then make a decision on that, but I think that as more and more people are moving around as we come to the end of the shielding period, there is probably a logical reason as to why face coverings should be a thing that we are all .Speaking to the media without Mrs Foster, she explained that they had moved naturally away from their joint appearances at the daily Stormont briefings.Mrs O#Neill echoed the Taoiseach#s call for an all-island approach to Covid-, and said the two governments# chief medical advisers were working closely together.Although Sinn Fein has now resumed the role of Opposition in the Dail, she promised to cooperate with the Taoiseach in his role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.In a statement, she also stressed the importance of the North-South Ministerial Council ing to work after a y absence.It is now six months since the restoration of the Executive and I made clear to Micheal that we must see delivery of all the Irish Government#s commitments in New Decade, New Approach.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Unmasked: Breakdown of Northern Ireland Covid- deaths by postcodeGrave of murdered Warren Crossan vandalised in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region. Holidays abroad may be off the agenda for many of us this year, but that offers a great opportunity to discover what lies on our doorstep in Northern Ireland. Tourism chiefs are asking everyone to “embrace Northern Ireland’s giant spirit” and experience it through the eyes of a tourist. googletag.cmd.push This summer presents an opportunity to check out great hotels and tourist spots that have been on the list to explore for years. As well as the big name attractions like the Giant’s Causeway, the Titanic centre in Belfast and the Gobbins coastal walkway, there are many other areas of great beauty and many places of great interest to visit. By planning a trip at home, you can travel at your own pace, easily pack a car up with all your necessities and even add some extra games for the kids to enjoy. You can map out and explore the incredible scenery on your travels, such as Lough Na Forest Park in googletag.cmd.push County Fermanagh with its km scenic drive leading to spectacular views. We’ve all missed our friends during lockdown but as Northern Ireland re-opens, there are now opportunities to visit friends while still social distancing. Why not plan a holiday in conjunction with a few friends  You can travel in separate cars or meet up at dferent points of your trip and have a proper catch-up. If you play golf, we have some world class courses, including Royal Portrush. For foodies, what about Taste and Tour in Belfast to take you “off the eaten track”.  BEST FEET FORWARD: The spectacular Gobbins clf top walkway in Northern Ireland They are taking bookings from July .

The tourism industry is eager to welcome back visitors and by planning your next vacation at home, you will be playing a pivotal role in supporting local businesses, historic sites and areas of natural beauty as they implement all required measures to protect people from Covid-.  RELAX: Galgorm Spa and Golf Resort Take time to ensure that you are in the know before you go Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors. To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.  Take time to know before you go Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream. And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands. Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling. Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the visitbritain website. Mark that shows we are good to go in Northern Ireland With many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Tourism Northern Ireland has teamed up with VisitScotland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening. The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a Covid- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join. “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely. This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance, saidUK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston.  READY: We’re Good To Go in Northern Ireland “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.” Tourism Northern Ireland chief executive officer John McGrillen said: “The rolling out of a UK wide industry standard and consumer mark is good news for the many tourism businesses across Northern Ireland who are gearing up to reopen their doors in the coming weeks. “They will be putting every possible measure in place to operate safely and provide reassurance to staff and customers alike that they have complied with official health guidance.” “We are acutely aware of the dficulties faced as the tourism sector reopens and the challenges ahead as we rebuild. However, we are confident that with the right measures in place and with ongoing support, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland can regain lost ground andto growth. “We have been delighted to partner with the national tourism agencies in Wales, Scotland and England to create a common approach. To obtain the mark, businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  goodtogo.visitbritain, including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCP-boqqGOoCFVHHQodAIExg\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\"    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

County Derry has a wide range of independent retailers in its town centres of Maghera and Magherafelt, as well as the surrounding villages and towns.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district.

I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11596986.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Alex Kane is right, this is the endgame, probably a -year endgame.\"I was struck by the reference Alex made to the endgame ‘ Unionism needs a strategy because this is the endgame,’ July , and the need for unionists to develop a strategy, and by the endless appeasement of Sinn Fein highlighted by Ben ‘The appeasing of Sinn Fein will not stop, so the Ulster Unionists should now go into opposition,’ July . I also could not help but reflect on the rather robotic statement of the patently obvious by Mr Bruton, Sinn Fein does not respect the Irish constitution A Taoiseach cannot celebrate IRA violence and be loyal to the Irish constitution, which gives the state a monopoly on force,’ July . Clearly the party does not, yet the Irish state constantly supports many of its outrageous demands on the UK.Mr Bruton’s words were well-meant, but I was surprised at how foreign he seemed.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorIs this the area in which something can be done to boost the Union, and a strategy developed to call a spade a spade  Has the Republic, perhaps, delighted us enough A problem with the old guard of the DUP is that they would regard someone like me as a clueless liberal, despite what I have just said. I have form on Brexit, LGBT rights, all manner of things. But, I would refer them to a warning letter that I sent to the News Letter in , when that same DUP old guard was cheering Boris Johnson to the rafters.My next statement would attract equal derision from the deep thinkers of the DUP— we should treat Sinn Fein in the North and in the South dferently. Of course, they are one and the same. But, when defending the Union, it’s perception that matters. It’s the hearts and minds of people in the North that we need to win, not just the solid flag-waving unionist third, but the soft unionists, and people in the broad centre as well, including many nationalists. There are no votes in the Irish Republic. There are votes that we absolutely must win in the North. That is done through consensus at home, not confrontation.Unionism is frustrated. Alex is right, this is the endgame. I think it’s probably a -year endgame, with the clock ticking now.I still maintain that Stormont should not be collapsed, nor should any unionist party go into opposition at the moment. As for Boris Johnson, he may act in the union’s interest, but onlythat mirrors his own.Some unionists are becoming desperate at all this. There is constant complaining about Sinn Fein, as well as the activities of the Irish state. So, it’s time for less talk of friendship with the Republic, and more talk of their politicians very seriously irritating us. As for Sinn Fein politicians in the South, it’s time for open hostility with them, at a political level.But, for our own citizens in the North, including Michelle O’Neill, we should seek consensus and cooperation. That should spook extremist republicans, north and south. Importantly, it would help all Northern Ireland voters distinguish between their own precious home country, where we will make everyone matter, and the increasingly tiresome Republic next door, which matters rather less.This is the best I can do.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
