She was in her element – her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride’Her name is Joy and I photographed her outside one of the many African churches in south-east London. I had just finished photographing a mosque on the same bland industrial estate when I found the blue wall, then spotted Joy dancing in the church with her children. I thought: “That’s a portrait I’ve got to get,” and asked if she’d come outside and have her photograph taken.Her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride. She’s in her element, in church, in a place where she can showcase her Nigerian clothes. When you put that across in the isive time in which we’re living, it paints a positive story about her identity as a Londoner, especially when you consider the wider context. Six countries in Europe have banned the burqa (16 worldwide) and Quebec has banned all religious symbols, but London has created spaces for people to celebrate their cultural heritage, and that’s special.Joy’s church is Christ’s Chosen Church of God. It’s one of several black-majority churches in streets where old warehouses are being used for Sunday worship. The services contrast with the mundane exteriors: worshipping God among the Nigerian community is a very celebratory experience. Outfits such as Joy’s are commonplace, and a good amount of the service is spent dancing and singing. I think that’s why so few people I approached for this project said no to being photographed – they are happy to do it when they feel good about themselves.I photographed Joy in August 2019, towards the end of a three-year project I called Sunday Best, which celebrates London’s religious ersity through portraits and stories of Londoners dressed for worship. My first idea was to photograph African churches in my area of south London, because the black teens in their Sunday best look so different from the negative stereotypes about hoodie culture. The project was shaped and expanded by events that unfolded thereafter.In June 2016, there was the Brexit vote, then the terrorist attacks in London in June 2017, which came just after I had a baby. I started to feel very pessimistic about bringing a child up in Britain, but after the Grenfell Tower fire I read all these tweets from people from other countries saying how much they admired the way the British – of all religions and races – pulled together in times of crisis. The lens through which other countries saw us seemed much more empathetic than how we view ourselves, and that made me want to reinforce a more positive vision of what it means to British.I chose to look at multiculturalism through religion because it’s so attached to national and cultural identity, and I sought out places of worship that served particular communities rather than particular denominations. The response I got came as a surprise, people saying: “We are British, and part of being British is being able to celebrate who we are. You don’t get this anywhere else in the world.” Such experiences built a celebratory and optimistic foundation for the project, amid a sombre national mood.As I went into the various places of worship, I became very aware of my own cultural misconceptions. I’m not religious, and I think that people like me sometimes think of religion in terms of ill-informed assumptions and problems. Take Islam. There are very narrow representations of Muslims in the media, but it’s a religion of 1.8 billion people. It can’t be represented by a few stereotypes. There’s a culture of fear based on a simple lack of understanding and knowledge that then breeds separatism and mistrust. But what religion brings to people’s lives in terms of a sense of belonging, companionship and community far outweighs the negatives. The religious people I spoke with talked about prayer and how much it helps with mental health.The religious ersity of London – and other cities such as Leicester, Manchester or Birmingham – should be celebrated. There are many different ways of telling stories of Britishness, but it’s the isive ones that are predominating at the moment. Instead of submitting to negative depictions, I want to use photography to show the best of who we are. • Sunday Best by Katie Waggett is published by Hoxton Mini Press.Training: BA graphic arts and design at Leeds politan University, and MA photojournalism and documentary photography at London College of Communication.Influences: Diane Arbus, Liz Hingley, Vanessa Winship, and my mother, Jackie Waggett, who was a painter and printmaker.High point: ‘Every time I come back with a portrait I’m proud of.’Low point: ‘Someone I adored died last year, and the way I found out destroyed me. I threw myself into photography, which became a kind of therapy for me. I try to hold on to the idea that a low point can also be creative.’Top tip: ‘If you want to photograph a stranger, smile as you approach. That sense of trust needs to be there from the start. It’s so simple, but many people who try to do what I do get turned down because they forget.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b626295d7d85d29d223ca05c4b7b1dc1aa23f752/10_0_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f3dc29173c2d03b01a6d35a6d4c8d5","title":"home safe home artist messages limited edition posters in pictures","story":"Need some encouragement to stay indoors?

Dramatise!” Henry James exhorted in his notebooks and the prefaces to his collected works. When shaping his novels and stories he struggled with the negotiation between what could be conveyed dramatically – the “explosive” material, as he called it – and what needed to be summarised. In the language of the creative writing workshop this complex negotiation has become simplified into the widespread precept: show, don’t tell.AL Kennedy is a veteran creative writing teacher, which she has written about with great insight and generosity in her book On Writing. She has also, over the course of almost 20 novels and short story collections, proven her talent and its ambition. But perhaps she has tired of creative writing dogma, because for much of We Are Attempting to Survive Our Time she constructs her stories in the most non-dramatic ways possible: this book is an orgy of telling, and it makes for exhausting reading.Numerous stories that sound engaging in outline are scuttled by their execution. “Even Words Have Meaning” traces a reporter’s journey through north Africa and Europe in the final years of the second world war, but his monologue contains more historical anecdote and second-hand retelling than inidual experience he doesn’t witness the display of Mussolini’s corpse, for example, but recalls talking to someone who did. Only in the very final pages, when the story is more consistently about what he has witnessed, does it become compelling.“Inappropriate Staring” describes an argument at a zoo between a woman and a xenophobic man who has “a voice invented not so long ago … apparently with the sole intention of more perfectly expressing angry whiteness”. But Kennedy fragments this argument, the story’s main dramatic action, over 31 long pages of internal monologue. In an ironic flourish she gives her prolix narrator the catchphrase “long story” (“And I’m on a kind of break here – long story – not a holiday, but a break”), but the in-joke doesn’t make the story any less bloated.“New Mexico” revolves around a woman’s discovery that a serial killer murdered her mother. The story takes the form of a podcast monologue, complete with an ad for a fictional luggage company (“I mostly use the Amagordo Travel Purse and the Sioux Falls Carry-on”) that drags on for two pages.“Am Sonntag” fails for different reasons. A woman who has been liberated from a Nazi camp wakes up in some kind of refugee station, and scraps of her wartime experience and prior life are revealed as she follows the sound of a piano to its source. It’s hard to say for certain if this is a Holocaust story because Kennedy is so vague and sparing with details, and there were after all plenty of activities and identities that consigned iniduals to Third Reich concentration camps. But the fact this woman’s whole family was rounded up, and that she is the only survivor, suggests her crime was Jewishness.The lack of specific detail makes the story feel thin, as do its simplistic insights: “Cafes make you have faith in civil stability. But the monsters like cafes, as well.” The piercing stories of Tadeusz Borowski or Ida Fink, survivors of Auschwitz and the Zbaraż ghetto respectively, are filled with indelible concrete images and affect your emotional weather for days. “Am Sonntag” evaporates as quickly as morning mist, the victim of its own tasteful mournfulness.The best story here, by some distance, is the one in which showing far outweighs telling. In “Spider”, an academic called Anne is at home with her children. Her German Kurdish husband is out shopping. The family has been receiving anonymous racist threats. Gripped by a sudden fear in the middle of the afternoon, Anne begins turning on every light: “Let’s switch all the lamps on, shall we? Let’s make the whole of the house shine so that everyone can see us being happy when the dark comes.”This powerful story captures the isolating terror of persecution and provokes that feeling in the reader, rather than merely reporting it from a deadening remove. We are carried through it as if by a strong current. That most of We Are Attempting to Survive Our Time fatally lacks this momentum raises the question why Kennedy should be so determined to renounce the dramatic. For all the telling in these pages she never tells us that.• We Are Attempting to Survive Our Time is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Tesco said the proceeds would be used for “general corporate purposes”.Tesco had struggled to gain market share in Poland, and it had higher costs relative to competitors. Tesco also said it would continue to try to sell 19 stores not included in the deal, after agreeing deals to sell 22 stores for net proceeds of £200m in the last 18 months.Tesco has left Japan, South Korea, the US and Turkey in recent years. Most recently in March it sold its south-east Asian operations in Thailand and Malaysia for $10.6bn (£8.5bn) in cash.The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: “We have seen significant progress in our business in central Europe but continue to see market challenges in Poland.

Coordination is the name of the game: it needs to keep on top of the huge amount of issuance – borrowing – by the UK government. Wartime levels of debt means the BoE must expand the envelope to hoover it up or risk yields starting to rise and spreads widening.  So, the BoE is expected to increase quantitative easing by at least £100bn, but I think it may well opt for £200bn, or even more, given that even £100bn would only last it until the end of the summer and the real long-term economic problems are going to emerge later in the autumn. The Swiss National Bank’s chairman Thomas Jordan said the central bank’s negative rates – the lowest in the world – are needed to help Switzerland get through its worst recession in decades.He told a news conference that before the bank will consider a policy change,we need more inflation and a much better economic outlook.David Oxley, senior Europe economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, says:The SNB’s policy rate is set to remain on hold well beyond the end of our two-year forecast horizon and, in all probability, until at least late in the decade. The SNB is clearly reticent to avoid heaping more pressure on the banking sector and signs that European policymakers are getting their act together should allow the franc to ease back further over the coming years. All told, we expect foreign exchange interventions to remain the Bank’s weapon of choice to fend off bouts of upwards pressure on the currency.European stock markets have turned positive, but gains are limited by fears over the fresh surge in Covid-19 infections in the United States and Beijing.The Unfriend Coal  Insure Our Future campaign group is calling on insurers to end all support for new oil and gas projects, as it revealed that a quarter of the top companies in the sector have committed to a 1.5°C global warming target.Unfriend Coal, which is now known as Insure Our Future, includes 18 environmental groups such as Greenpeace, 350.org and Oil Change International. Insurers have started pulling out of coal in recent years, partly due to pressure from the campaign group. It has now turned its attention to oil and gas projects.Its research shows that out of the 15 biggest oil and gas insurers:Oil Change International has found that CO2 emissions from the oil, gas and coal in existing fields and mines will push the world far beyond 1.5°C of warming.Insure Our Future has written to the chief executives of 27 leading property \u0026amp casualty insurers and three major insurance investors (Aviva, Legal \u0026amp General and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America), saying:Insurers have a responsibility to support international climate targets and align their businesses with the Paris Agreement.Covid-19 is irreversibly reshaping the energy and power sectors, and the massive disruption of the coal, oil and gas markets offers a great chance for insurance companies to reposition themselves for a lowcarbon future. The reduced revenues from fossil fuel operations and the surge of renewable energy sources provide a perfect time for adopting or strengthening fossil fuel exit policies, esting from fossil fuel companies not engaged in rapid decarbonization processes, and advocating for the shift away from fossil fuels as corporate citizens. We’ve seen how quickly insurers have retreated from coal in the last three years – 19 now have limited coal insurance – so can we now expect this momentum to be continued in oil and gas? asked a spokesman for the campaign group.Norway’s central bank has kept its main interest rate on hold, at a record low of zero. It said the economic outlook had improved more than expected in recent weeks.Since the monetary policy meeting in May, activity has picked up faster than expected. The policy rate forecast implies a rate at the current level over the next couple of years, followed by a gradual rise as economic conditions normalise.Unlike other central banks, Norges Bank can’t really do bond-buying (known as quantitative easing), because Norway’s debt market is small.Taylor Wimpey, one of the UK’s big housebuilders, this morning announced the results of its share sale: it raised £522m (more than expected) after selling 355m new shares at 145p to institutional and other investors, including employees, as it looks to acquire more land at lower prices. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:Yesterday’s announcement that the company was looking to raise extra funds caught a lot of people by surprise, however management seem keen to avail themselves of a recent fall in land prices, in expectation of a pickup in the housing market a few years down the line.Tesco is selling its Polish ision to a Danish group for £181m as it continues to retreat from international markets to focus on the UK.After struggling to gain market share in Poland, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain decided to offload its 301-strong store business there to Salling Group, the Danish owner of the Netto supermarket chain.Tesco has already pulled out of Japan, South Korea, the US and Turkey in recent years. The latest sale leaves it with Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia as the only major operations outside the UK.Britain’s financial watchdog said this morning that it would make permanent its ban on the mass marketing of speculative mini-bonds and other illiquid securities to retail investors.The Financial Conduct Authority introduced the ban without consultation in January due to concerns that speculative mini-bonds were being promoted to retail investors who neither understood the risks involved, nor could afford the potential financial losses.The FCA is extending the ban to include listed bonds with similar features to speculative illiquid securities and which are not regularly traded.Sheldon Mills, interim executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said:We know that investing in these types of products can lead to unexpected and significant loses for investors. We have already taken a wide range of action in order to protect consumers and by making the ban permanent we aim to prevent people investing in complex, high risk products which are often designed to be hard to understand.Since we introduced the marketing ban we have seen evidence that firms are promoting other types of bonds which are not regularly traded to retail investors. We are very concerned about this and so we have proposed extending the scope of the ban.”The term mini-bond refers to a range of investments. The ban will apply to the most complex and opaque arrangements where the funds raised are used to lend to a third party, or to buy or acquire investments, or to buy or fund the construction of property. There are various exemptions including for listed bonds which are regularly traded, companies which raise funds for their own commercial or industrial activities, and products which fund a single UK income-generating property investment.The FCA ban means that products caught by the rules can only be promoted to investors who are “sophisticated or high net worth”. Marketing material will also have to include a specific risk warning and disclose any costs or payments to third parties that are deducted from the money raised from investors.In case you missed this yesterday, Londoners can look forward to more al fresco dining soon – and pretend they are on holiday in the Med. A swathe of central London is to be transformed into a huge continental-style outdoor dining area under plans to keep bars and restaurants in business.Westminister council is lining up 50 projects to make space for al-fresco dining including pavement widening and temporary road closures for part of the day in popular districts such as Chinatown, Covent Garden, Soho and Mayfair. Some small streets near Oxford Circus could also be closed for part of the day to accommodate tables.Hopefully this will also happen in other cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham, where the authorities are working on plans to pedestrianise streets or widen pavements to allow more space for outdoor tables.Overnight, two major British firms pledged to make payments to organisations representing black people and those of other minority ethnic backgrounds, after records emerged of their founders’ roles in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lloyd’s, the world’s oldest and biggest insurance market, and Greene King, the pub and brewery company both revealed that they would be making the reparations, without disclosing the sums involved. The news was first reported by the .Records archived by researchers at University College London (UCL) show that one of Greene King’s founders, Benjamin Greene, held at least 231 human beings in slavery and became an enthusiastic supporter of the practice.Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive officer, said on Wednesday night:It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s.The UCL records also show that Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s, held at least 162 people in slavery and was paid the equivalent of nearly £400,000 at today’s rate for ceding a plantation in Dominica, while yet more were held at a site in British Guiana researchers believe either belonged to him or to his son.Lloyd’s apologised in a lengthy statement. A spokesman said:Lloyd’s has a long and rich history dating back over 330 years, but there are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade. This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period.And we’re off. UK and European shares have opened lower, as expected.National Grid is braced for a £400m hit to its operating profits in the current financial year as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to wipe up to £1bn from the company’s cashflows, reports our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose.It warned investors that its results for the current financial year would take a hit due to lower levels of energy use during the pandemic lockdown, and higher levels of ‘bad debt’ from customers in the US.John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, said the financial impact of Covid-19 will be “largely recoverable over future years” and that the company anticipates “no material economic impact on the Group in the long-term”.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.The rally on stock markets looks to have fizzled out, as hopes of a V-shaped economic recovery are overtaken by fears of a second coronavirus wave. There has been a jump in new infections in several US states as lockdowns are eased. Beijing has seen the biggest resurgence in the disease since early February and has reinstated travel bans and school closures, as well as cancelling dozens of flights.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: With plummeting inflation, rising unemployment and lingering risks of a no-deal Brexit, the bank has room and solid reasons to move towards a more unorthodox policy. While the BoE’s near zero rates and massive asset purchases should push the consumer prices higher in the long run, inflation will probably not be a cause for concern in the foreseeable future.Given the expectation of quantitative easing expansion is fully priced in, the BoE announcement per se may not move the market significantly unless we see a meaningfully different outcome from the BoE meeting or a hint for more policy easing in the foreseeable future.When Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, testified before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday, he reiterated that the Fed was ready to act if more support was needed for the economy. He said it would be unwise for Congress to curtail its support for the economy too quickly.Finally, president Donald Trump has tried to enlist Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s help to secure re-election in November, a new book from ex-National Security adviser John Bolton says.

Wading unto the breach and armed with the knowledge of how close capitalism came to a system failure in 2008, they have fired the “big bazookas” of monetary policy, pumping trillions of dollars into the world’s giant pool of money, effectively creating wealth out of nothing.This confidence is misplaced. Both left and right have reason to welcome the Fed’s emergency intervention, but new money flooded into private capital markets will inevitably flow into the deepest pockets. And without strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this policy, and using it for socially transformative ends, the reaction will strengthen those who are antagonistic to the practice of government – the populist right.In his recent book, the French economist Thomas Piketty observes that central banks have become the only effectively functioning organs of government. He doesn’t mean this as a good thing. “Monetary activism” is financial triage against world economic collapse, but it’s also an avoidance tactic. It works by bracketing democracy and letting the technocrats take over. To make decisions about justice and distribution, discussions about taxation, policy and budgets are needed.As the Fed chairman Jerome Powell put it, the central bank has the power to lend but not to tax and spend. It is up to elected officials to “make decisions about where we as a society should direct our collective resources”. In the last two months, he has all but begged Congress to be more proactive in shaping the direction and volume of the policy.Progressives have reason to praise central banks for offering evidence that the “money printer can go brrr” without any clear limit. Economists see no sign of inflation on the horizon. Some have become concerned about inflation in recent weeks, but others worry about the opposite – deflation. All the extra liquidity has not managed to translate into meaningful growth.This makes an active role for the state in hiring people in sustainable jobs – in green energy, construction, arts, healthcare, education – all the more important. Public spending of the New Deal helped cure the Great Depression in the 1930s, so why not a Green New Deal for this one? Central bankers have emerged as unlikely allies in the fight against climate change. Maybe this latest intervention could finally open them up to the idea of “Green QE”, (quantitative easing) actively supporting decarbonisation by buying up environmentally friendly bonds.Republicans, for their part, are relieved that the Fed rescued the economy from meltdown, giving Donald Trump at least a chance of campaigning amid a recovery. Though unemployment is stratospheric and hundreds of Americans are still dying of Covid-19, the stock market’s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed’s promised bond-buying spree. But neither side should feel secure under the sheltering hand of unelected power like the central bank.The politics of money has a way of quickly becoming about other things. Last month, the German constitutional court concluded in a shock ruling that the European Central Bank may have exceeded its mandate in creating so much cheap credit, threatening the monetary response to the crisis. Within days, Viktor Orbán suggested that the Hungarian constitution might trump the decisions of the European Court of Justice in his country’s treatment of refugees.What kind of political creatures could the money-printing of central banks spawn? We have seen hints in the past. A decade ago, the proactive Fed was a target for the Tea Party movement. Republicans directed the backlash to control of the House in 2010 and eventually over Congress. Opposing President Barack Obama, the Republican party acted as a drag on recovery efforts and robust healthcare reform. The US is paying the price for their efforts with a dysfunctional healthcare system in a pandemic in which the victims have been disproportionately African American.There are reasons to think the response to the Fed’s actions from the right might be more extreme this time, not only because the scale of both spending and suffering is greater, but also because the fringe itself has become radicalised.Central banks have no shortage of enemies in waiting. President Trump’s description of the Fed as the “enemy” is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without. Libertarians who reject all forms of “fiat currency” unbacked by precious metals, commonly known as “gold bugs”, have grown in influence over the past years. In the US, the most famous libertarian gold bug is probably Ron Paul, whose demand to “End the Fed” ran through his 2008 campaign. His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have also voiced support for a gold standard. Returning to currency that is matched by finite gold reserves could act as a lever to lock in austerity, blocking the expansion of credit and state spending that would be necessary to redress inequality.In Germany, another gold bug, a former precious metals consultant, Peter Boehringer, sits in the Bundestag. His party, the Alternative for Germany, was founded by economics professors in 2013 over the politics of money – they rejected the European Central Bank’s monetary policy and management of the eurozone crisis.Another erstwhile gold bug now waits in the antechamber of the Fed itself. Until its recent postponement, Congress was scheduled to vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Fed. Citing Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek as her guides, Shelton has called repeatedly in the past for the return to the “sound money” of a gold standard before converting to Trump’s loose monetary policy.For now, alongside the rumblings of a backlash, the actions of the Fed are receiving broad public approval. Elected officials should take this support as a sign that people do not instinctively reject a role for the government in the working of the market under emergency conditions.Lawmakers have time to build on this insight to work with central banks to design economies where uncertainty and hardship are diminished, even after coronavirus has passed. Central banks can be accessories to more equal and just societies, but they can never be the architects. Money must be made to serve the people, not the other way around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1260bdbf76a9962a3c6d2f76a553ee26048bbb/0_209_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d1a354d83bd7bb66e80ed699757d414","title":"dominic cummings single mother support bubbles","story":"Enraged by the Durham saga, I wrote to Boris Johnson’s adviser. I never expected a responseMy phone was buzzing off the hook. Congratulations were in order. As a single mum in lockdown with her two young boys, I had supposedly helped influence the government policy on support bubbles. How could that be, when I hadn’t even found the time to clean my bathroom?Two weeks earlier, enraged by the Cummings saga that was iding the nation, I took matters into my own hands. Bundling my youngest into his bike seat and placing my six-year-old on his bike, we cycled to the home of Britain’s most wanted man.As we neared the crowd outside the townhouse, I felt nervous. Holding my youngest on my hip and pulling my eldest in close, I strode through the parting reporters. “I’m just here to post a letter,” I stated to the policeman guarding their home. “I can take that for you,” he replied as I relinquished my handwritten letter addressed to Mr and Mrs Cummings. My greatest hope, as I watched him disappear round the side of their house, was that Dominic Cummings would take a moment to read my letter before – I assumed – throwing it in the bin.When lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23 March, many single parents lost their support networks at one fell swoop. Trying to balance working, with home schooling, caring for a little one and maintaining a home was impossible. Have you ever wondered what it does to a human to have no meaningful adult contact for weeks on end, or recourse to a hug, while caring for children 247? In my letter, I explained how, prior to lockdown, my two young boys and I all went down with suspected Covid-19. I described this time as “unbearable”. “There wasn’t one day where I didn’t cry from the pressures, the exhaustion and the worries I was under.” Relatives and friends dropped off food and sent packages, for which I’m eternally grateful, but it didn’t remove the loneliness.As the days became weeks, this turned into complete isolation. Even phone calls with friends seemed impossible with a little one who followed me around like a tail. Over the weeks my sense of failure as a mother deepened as I cried too much and angered too quickly. By the time lockdown began to ease I’d fallen into a hole that was all-consuming I’m still struggling to emerge now.Two days after my impassioned letter was delivered, an email appeared in my inbox. It took me a few moments to work out who it was from. “Thanks so very much for your moving and powerful letter and for dropping it round,” Mary Wakefield began. The letter I’d feared would be discarded hadn’t just been read it had made an impression.Mary went on to say that the letter had helped her and Dominic understand the predicament of single mothers. He was keen to connect and see what the government could do for isolated single parents. Less than two weeks later I was speaking with a policy adviser at No 10 advocating for social bubbles, priority shopping and greater support for single parents. Two days after the phone call, support bubbles for single parents were announced by the prime minister at the daily press conference.Could they really never have considered single parents before? For me, having been writing about single motherhood for years, the answer is a resounding yes. People don’t often understand our lives, and many aren’t interested in trying to. In normal times the experience of the single mum includes being passed over for promotion, discriminated against in child benefit rules, and judged as a bad parent for not meeting the standards of a family with twice the resources. It’s well known that the prime minister is more famous for berating single mums than supporting them.I’m under no illusion that my letter was the only factor in this policy change. Support bubbles weren’t a new idea – New Zealand introduced them first, and many single parents in the UK lobbied for them. But, sometimes, a personal story can cut through the stats and facts to provide a picture of real life. Whatever the motive behind the shift in policy, single parents have finally been identified as a group with specific needs in this pandemic.Time will tell whether this is a one-off, or whether single parents are being given the recognition and rights we deserve to enable us to navigate life on a more equal footing. This isn’t the end of my campaigning journey. Single parents need practical, emotional and financial support during and after lockdown. To ensure this happens, single parenthood should be a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 and afforded the same rights as married coupledom. Only then will policymakers consider us as anything more than an afterthought, and only then will our experiences of discrimination be treated as such in law.• Ella Davis writes a blog on the trials and tribulations of life in London as a single mother to two young boys"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/369c6b2c3c04d7422383f5feac89c9ef3b917f3e/0_437_3846_2307/master/3846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d648f6870c97981154b8be96dac9b9c","title":"lying history britain statues slave trade","story":"Protesters may be toppling statues, but millions of records about the end of empire and the slave trade were destroyed by the stateBut lying about our history – and particularly about our late-colonial history – has been a habit of the British state for decades.In 2013 I discovered that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been unlawfully concealing 1.2m historical files at a highly secure government compound at Hanslope Park, north of London.Those files contained millions upon millions of pages of records stretching back to 1662, ning the slave trade, the Boer wars, two world wars, the cold war and the UK’s entry into the European Common Market. More than 20,000 files concerned the withdrawal from empire.There were so many of them that they took up 15 miles of floor-to-ceiling shelving at a specially built repository that a Foreign Office minister had opened in a private ceremony in 1992. Their retention was in breach of the Public Records Acts, and they had effectively been held beyond the reach of the Freedom of Information Act.The FCO was not alone: at two warehouses in the English midlands, the UK’s Ministry of Defence was at the same time unlawfully hoarding 66,000 historical files, including many about the conflict in Northern Ireland.When the files concerned with the withdrawal from empire began to be transferred to the UK’s National Archives – where they should have been for years, and where historians and members of the public could finally examine them – it became clear that enormous amounts of documentation had been destroyed during the process of decolonisation.Helpfully perhaps, colonial officials had completed “destruction certificates”, in which they declared that they had disposed of sensitive papers, and many of these certificates had survived within the secret archive.Beginning in India in 1947, government officials had incinerated material that would in any way embarrass Her Majesty’s government, her armed forces, or her colonial civil servants. At the end of that year, an Observer correspondent noted large palls of smoke appearing over government offices in Jerusalem.As decolonisation gathered pace, British officials developed a series of parallel file registries in the colonies: one that was to be handed over to post-independence governments, and one that contained papers that were to be steadily destroyed or flown back to London.As a consequence, newly independent governments found themselves attempting to administer their territories on the basis of an incomplete record of what had happened before.In Uganda in March 1961, colonial officials gave this process a new name: Operation Legacy. Before long the term spread to neighbouring colonies, where only “British subjects of European descent” were to be involved in the weeding and destruction of documents, a process that was overseen by police special branch officers. A new security classification, the “W” or “Watch series”, was introduced, and sensitive papers were stamped with a red letter W.Subsequently, there was the “Guard series” of papers stamped with a letter “G”. These could be shared with officials from Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, but whenever this happened “the information should be accompanied by an oral warning that it must not be communicated to the Americans”. The Americans, it seems to have been assumed, were likely to be less forgiving of the sins of empire.In May that year the colonial secretary, Iain Macleod, issued instructions that the documents to be destroyed or smuggled back to London should include anything that might embarrass HMG embarrass her military, police or public servants that might compromise sources of intelligence or which could be used “unethically” by post-independence governments.By “unethically”, Macleod appears to mean that he did not wish to see the governments of newly independent nations expose, or threaten to expose, some of the more challenging aspects of the end of empire. There was certainly plenty to hide: the torture and murder of rebels in Kenya the brutal suppression of insurgencies in Cyprus and later Aden massacres in Malaya the toppling of a democratically elected government in British Guiana.Instructions were also issued on the means by which papers should be destroyed: when they were burned, “the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up”. In Kenya, officials were informed that “it is permissible, as an alternative to destruction by fire, for documents to packed in weighed crates and dumped in very deep and current-free waters at maximum practicable distance from the coast”.Operation Legacy was, as one colonial official admitted, “an orgy of destruction”, and it was carried out across the globe between the late 1940s and the early 70s.The operation – and its attempts to conceal and manipulate history in an attempt to sculpt an official narrative – speaks of a certain jitteriness on the part of the British state, as if it feared that interpretations of the past that were based upon its own records would find it difficult to celebrate the “greatness” of British history.It seems likely that uncertainty about the imperial mission also played a part in the commissioning of Colston’s statue. It was erected in 1895, a full 174 years after his death, at a time when the British were anxious about their rapidly expanded empire. The first Boer war had ended badly for them, exposing the physical weakness of soldiers recruited from urban slums the United States was emerging as an industrial force and Germany appeared to be challenging the Royal Navy’s maritime dominance.The answer, it seems, was the erection of statues, up and down the United Kingdom, of early “heroes” of empire – even slave traders – as an inspiring example to the adventurers and imperialists to come.Now that’s an act of act of historical revisionism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a232bd320f6fb123df8a2f230ef6170cdfd23ac/0_162_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e24de1b26f41d06153be61a730cc57e5","title":"marcus rashford black athletes power change british racism poverty","story":"Black British sportspeople are seizing the moment to speak out about racism and povertyMarcus Rashford has done something that few of us can or ever will be able to achieve. The Manchester United and England forward has spurred a genuine change in social policy, altering the direction of government funding. And he has raised the awareness of two issues, food insecurity and holiday hunger, that should not be a problem in a country as wealthy as England.Rashford has been working with the charity FareShare, raising £20m to help it provide 3 million meals for vulnerable people. This week, his open and personal letter to the government (and his #maketheUturn campaign) asked it to reverse the decision to end the food voucher scheme before the summer holidays – vouchers that have been available to children on free school meals during the lockdown.In response to Rashford’s campaign, the government made a U-turn and set up the £120m “Covid summer food fund”. The fund will potentially benefit up to 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals in England. The 22-year-old from Wythenshawe didn’t need to do it. Rashford is young, rich and famous – and a black footballer, a tenuous position that provides little insulation from the pressure and attention of fans and the media that can topple a sports career faster than a cruciate knee ligament injury. But Rashford is part of a new wave of philanthropic black athletes giving their voice, their privilege and their wealth to social good. And for Rashford, like so many of these athletes, it’s personal.In recent years, Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling has called out the bigotry of the press and how its portrayal of black players fuels racism on the terraces. He has also advocated for more severe punishments for racism in football. Similarly in May, footballer Jadon Sancho took off his shirt, after scoring a goal for his German side Borussia Dortmund, to reveal the words “Justice for George Floyd” on a T-shirt, while world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua recently attended a Black Lives Matter protest in his home town of Watford, where he called for a greater focus on self-determination within the black community. And Dina Asher-Smith, the 200m champion of the 2019 World Athletics Championships, has put her name to the letter by the Black Collective of Media in Sport (BCOMS) calling for an increase in the number of people of colour in the media.These athletes are responding to a sustained period of betrayal from the state in Britain. Black lives remain disposable, a statement that remains undeniable after recent years of austerity, the hostile environment, the leave campaign in the Brexit referendum, Grenfell, Covid-19 and continued police brutality. It is hard to ignore when injustice stares you in the face, when it hurts your loved ones or when it prevents your offspring from accessing essential services. The narrow historical lens of white Britain continues to view black people, as I wrote in my book No Win Race, “culturally through our bodies and in society through our pain”.Modern-day black British athletes are seizing the moment to speak out, more so than previous generations. Historically, black athletes in Britain have had to manage how to keep it real for the black community while not selling out to the white mainstream. Pioneering black footballers such as John Barnes and Brendon Batson faced this dilemma in the 1970s and 80s. They confronted racism quietly, letting their performances do the talking and rarely displaying the outspoken activism we would see from, say, the West Indian cricket team of the time.In the 90s Ian Wright, the Arsenal and England striker, now a popular pundit, was perhaps the first athlete to make blackness and Britishness look compatible. He symbolised a change in perception of black Britain. Wright was brash, brilliant and unapologetic, but also widely adored by white England fans. But this period did not translate into the type of changes in power, policy and wealth required to disrupt our vulnerability to disposability in society. Racism mutates. And the goalposts for black people shifted.Sports or entertainment remained the acceptable platforms for progression. But we could not get enough seats around the decision-making tables. Worse still, the narrative of a multicultural nation at ease with itself that emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s actually served to deny the existence of racism in the UK.If black British athletes continue to wield power, they have the potential to be a force for change in sport and society. We have seen African American athletes in the US use their wealth and status to influence social issues. Serena Williams has invested in businesswomen of colour, while basketball star LeBron James’s More Than A Vote campaign is encouraging young people to register while combatting voter suppression. NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has become a symbol for contemporary athlete activism. Former athletes from Africa such as Kenyan long-distance runner Tegla Loroupe, Ivory Coast footballer Didier Drogba and Congolese basketball star Dikembe Mutombo have all contributed hugely to social change in their countries.Rashford’s activism shouldn’t, of course, obscure the many groups who have been campaigning for equitable and inclusive food systems for years. Nor should it blur the impact of athletes – such as former England international Eniola Aluko – who opened the doors for this generation to be more vocal. Tackling structural racism and the root causes of child poverty remain a priority.But Rashford’s campaign provides a decisive moment and a refreshing change from the habitually negative media representation of black people in this country. There is power in this moment. There is power in the potential of Rashford and other athlete-philanthropists to create significant change collectively. It is not their responsibility. It is the norms of the state that need to change. But these athletes have run out of patience. From our position in the stands, it feels good to celebrate such a positive story amid our heartbreak and rage.• Derek Bardowell is the author of No Win Race, published in paperback by MudlarkHarperCollins"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d16967fb048108cc640236065ea00fe2cb8f1291/730_993_4676_2805/master/4676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb8cd0c9ec16104561dd588fe0e27d7","title":"the real story behind britains far right is how their ideas became mainstream","story":"Saturday’s protests in London were truly worrying. But the ‘respectable’ right wing is in no position to disown them“What has become of the tolerant Britain we love?” asked the Mail on Sunday this weekend, its front-page headline about Saturday’s “protect the monuments” demonstration in central London. But while many rightwing media outlets and politicians have sought to decry the weekend’s violence, they show no signs of backing down from the culture war they have enthusiastically pursued in response to the recent Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests.In addition to its hand-wringing, the Mail on Sunday launched a petition demanding a pledge from the government that Winston Churchill’s statue would never be torn down. This, said the newspaper, “would not only reassure the British people, but also thwart the far right who, as we have seen, have been exploiting this controversy to stir up hatred”.In truth, the far right – at least in the sense the Mail means it, of a violent rightwing extremist street movement – has played a marginal role in this dispute. In recent weeks, the loudest voices accusing BLM of orchestrating “mob rule on our streets”, and of wanting to “destroy our economy and erase every aspect of our culture that isn’t to their liking” have come from among the political elite. National war memorials understandably generate strong emotions, since they commemorate people who have killed and been killed, and it was inevitable that attempts by a minority of protesters to deface the Churchill statue and the Cenotaph would generate a nationalist backlash that far-right agitators would try to co-opt. But the story of Saturday’s violence is one of people chasing after events rather than leading them.In Britain, the pattern over the last decade has been periodic brief outbursts of far-right protest that assemble around single issues and dissipate just as quickly. They are almost entirely reactive, a response to terrorist attacks like the string of killings in 2017, or perceived threats to national identity. Social media, and the rise of online far-right personalities such as the anti-Muslim activist “Tommy Robinson” (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), have made it easier and quicker to gather people to a particular cause, but efforts to turn this into a more organised movement have tended to collapse. Often it’s because many of the people drawn to support these causes don’t want anything to do with the small groups of ideologically committed fascists and neo-Nazis who try to take them over.As the anti-fascist organisation Hope not Hate reported last week, this was happening with the statue protests before they had even begun. Calls for action circulated on social media among football hooligan groups, who in 2017 had organised a march of around 35,000 people under the banner “Football Lads Alliance”, in a supposedly non-racist protest against Islamist terrorism. (A  investigation later found that a secret Facebook page used by some of the group was full of violent, racist and misogynist content.)By contrast, the organisers of this week’s rally – calls were led by a group calling itself the Democratic Football Lads Alliance – were unable to mobilise anywhere near the same numbers, amid attempts by far-right activists to ramp up the rhetoric. The small fascist group Britain First attended the demonstration, its leader wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan “White Lives Matter”. Robinson, whose public profile has been severely limited since he was banned from mainstream social media platforms, doesn’t seem to have even turned up, after initially calling on his followers to join the protest.Those who did made headlines not for confronting BLM protesters – most of whom had stayed away after organisers asked people to hold demonstrations outside central London instead – but for attacking police officers and journalists. One protester caused a scandal of his own by urinating next to a memorial to PC Keith Palmer, who was killed outside the Palace of Westminster in a terrorist attack in 2017.It’s important not to dismiss the danger of far-right street violence. Protests like the one on Saturday can be extremely threatening and unpleasant for people who cross their path, and are a way of intimidating ethnic and religious minorities, liberals, the left – or anyone else who is deemed not to fit into their vision of Britain. Violence might drive many potential supporters away, but others will get sucked into the extremist, conspiracy-theory-driven subcultures that thrive in this political scene.But the real story of the past decade has been how ideas once confined to the far-right fringe have entered mainstream politics through more respectable channels. A rootless liberal elite that works to sabotage the interests of the nation hordes of criminal migrants undermining the UK’s borders moral panics about Muslims or multi-ethnic urban Britain: these are all themes you’re far more likely to come across in “respectable” television and radio debates, or in the pages of rightwing newspapers, than from far-right street activists.When a minority of people show themselves willing to act on the violence implicit in those ideas, the media outlets and politicians who trade on them are quick to distance themselves. Yet in doing so, the right is denying its own shadow. Saturday’s protest may have played out as a formless cry of rage but the debate over racism and Britain’s identity, past and present, risks becoming even more polarised.• Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: The Rise of Britain’s Far Right"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9fe5032b2b0eba0f3e4bc8e4ae0f3043cf1cccd/0_540_2088_1253/master/2088.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=57f17f129a5b23b553b4ee80ba08431c","title":"uk amazon boss to become new head of natural history museum","story":"Doug Gurr will take over as director later this yearThe Natural History Museum has chosen Doug Gurr, the current boss of Amazon’s UK and Ireland operations, to be its new director.New Zealand-born Gurr will take over from Sir Michael Dixon, who has been in charge at the London museum for 15 years, later this year.Gurr was the development director at Asda for nearly five years before joining Amazon in 2011, where he ran its Chinese business and then took over its UK operations in 2016, with the aim of developing the firm’s grocery operation in Britain. He was one of the rumoured candidates for the BBC director general job earlier this year.The Natural History Museum is one of the most popular in the world, attracting 5.3 million people during 2018 to 2019, making it the fourth most popular attraction in the UK.“The Natural History Museum’s vision of a future where people and planet thrive has never been more relevant and it is a privilege to be invited to lead this globally important cultural and scientific institution,” Gurr said.He said he was passionate about the work the museum was doing to tackle the “planetary emergency” by using its collection and scientific research to “connect millions of people a year with nature”.Gurr’s immediate concerns will be ensuring the museum’s stability during and in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, as cultural institutions around the world readjust to many months of lost income. Other challenges will be the growing number of repatriation claims for items in the museum’s collection, such as the recent request from Gibraltar for two Neanderthal skulls.The new director has extensive experience of running online food businesses, and has also previously served on boards and acted as a trustee for high-profile museums. Gurr was the chair of the Science Museum’s board from 2010 to 2014, and was a trustee of the National Gallery.He also acted as a non-executive director at the Department for Work and Pensions, which attracted criticism from the Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge, who described his appointment as “disgusting” because Amazon was involved in a row over its taxes.Natural History Museum chair, Lord Stephen Green, said: “Doug’s academic background, considerable experience in working with public service organisations and digital understanding make him ideal to lead our treasured museum in our mission to create advocates for the planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c67aa1a0a044d7bfcb1032fee10f6dd5a321dba/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec1f6e64631f4a3581e93726f930a24c","title":"government to fund private tutors for english schools","story":"Year-long programme aims to help pupils catch up on learning lost during Covid-19 pandemicThe government is set to announce a year-long national tutoring programme aimed at helping pupils in England to catch up on lost learning as a result of school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic, the  has learned.Under the plans, schools will be funded to hire private tutors from approved agencies to deliver one-to-one and small group lessons to pupils who have fallen behind with their studies after months out of school. Many have not accessed any remote learning throughout lockdown.The multi-million-pound programme, to be funded by government, is expected to involve thousands of tutors and will be delivered in schools, with a mixture of online and face-to-face sessions, designed to support and complement pupils’ regular school work.The catch-up lessons will be available to pupils from all year groups in both primary and secondary and can be accessed by all schools, but will be targeted particularly at those serving disadvantaged communities where learning loss is likely to be greatest.The detail of the comprehensive tuition scheme is being finalised ready to be announced later this week, as the government tries to head off scathing criticism of its handling of children’s education during the pandemic.One study last week found that around 2 million children in the UK have done little or no schoolwork throughout.Union leaders reacted cautiously to the proposals, saying ministers couldn’t just present ideas that “simply sound good”, and raised concerns about whether it was possible to scale up the provision of private tutoring.Boris Johnson, under pressure during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, told MPs his education secretary Gavin Williamson would announce a “big catch-up plan” for pupils very shortly. “It’s vital that kids get the catch-up on the education they have lost,” he said.The government is encouraging secondary schools to bring in pupils for a one-off face-to-face review meeting before the end of term to find out what progress the student has made and what additional support might be required going into the next academic year.Some academy trusts are also looking at bringing in pupils a week early before the start of the autumn term to enable teachers to identify learning gaps and start preparing students for the rigours of academic study after a long gap.Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies trust that operates 29 state schools in England, said his group planned to help those most affected by the prolonged absence, including disadvantaged pupils and the year groups at significant transition points or facing exams next year.“Our strategy to bridge widening gaps, foster resilience and set our pupils up for success is built on planned interventions over a 12-month period. We intend to use a set of measures including summer holiday camp, Saturday school and planned literacy and numeracy catch-up sessions within the school timetable.”The government’s tuition programme is expected to be available from September and will form one of the main strands in the government’s education catch-up offer. “The overall catch-up package is quite significant,” said one source close to the project. “It will be long-term, at least a year. All schools will be able to access it, but it will be targeted at those with high numbers of disadvantaged pupils.”Summer holiday schemes are more likely to focus on sports, arts and citizenship – rather than academic work – with the aim of supporting pupils’ mental health and physical wellbeing after being locked down at home throughout the pandemic.The Sutton Trust, Education Endowment Foundation, Nesta and Impetus, who earlier this month jointly launched a new online tuition pilot to support disadvantaged pupils as schools began to open to more pupils, are expected to be involved in developing the catch-up tutoring programme.Launching the pilot, they quoted evidence supporting the use of one-to-one and small-group tuition as a cost-effective way to help pupils who are struggling regular sessions of 30 minutes, three to five times a week over six to 12 weeks, to achieve the best results, adding five additional months’ progress.One of the four models being piloted involved the Tutor Trust – a not-for-profit charity which recruits and trains university students and recent graduates as tutors in the core subjects of maths, English and science – who provide one-to-one tuition in state schools. The charity’s co-founder and chief executive, Nick Bent, said: “We want to play our part in this national effort to help disadvantaged pupils catch up.”Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said it was vital that the government’s catch-up programme should be a long-term endeavour, rather than just a summer holiday scheme. “Where tuition can have value is where it’s done alongside the curriculum. If the government is going to be spending money, I would suggest that those programmes start in the autumn and are strongly aligned with the work a school is doing.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “With so much legitimate concern about the growing gap between advantaged and disadvantaged young people, it’s essential that any plans to address the issue are based in evidence of what works rather than what may simply sound good.“The starting-point should be a review by the child’s teacher of where the child is now, and what their curriculum needs to look like. Schools should then be able to direct any additional resources, such as 1:1 after-school tuition, small group work, textbooks, to turbo-charge pupils’ learning.”Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We’ve got nothing against extra support for literacy and numeracy. The question with all these things is, if you are using private providers, how easy is it to scale up.”Meanwhile, more than 1,500 of the UK’s leading paediatricians and child health specialists have told Boris Johnson he needs to urgently publish the government’s plans for children to return to school, in an unprecedented warning that their absence “risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people”.The letter circulated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) – the first time it has asked its members to sign a joint message to the prime minister – quickly attracted hundreds of signatures in support of its blunt message: “Left unchecked, Covid-19 will exacerbate existing problems and deepen structural social and health inequalities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c459c3ed7d0fcf3f365dd192ed56ec613fa525/1_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f25f97aef5ddbe2c07b383ee4654a07f","title":"my lockdown spring watch a photo essay","story":" sports photographer  Tom Jenkins follows up his popular take on tulips during the enforced break from action photography. Here he talks about how photographing a pair of long-tailed tits nesting in his front garden helped him through a difficult spring“Bum barrels twit on bush and treeScarse bigger then a bumble beeAnd in a white thorn’s leafy restIt builds its curious pudding-nestWi hole beside as if a mouseHad built the little barrel house.”Recently, I was told that I was showing classic signs of “biophilia” – I had to open a dictionary to learn this meant enjoying “the love of life or living systems” and displaying the psychological condition of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. I had just published a picture essay about some tulips that were flourishing in my back garden. I was nervous submitting it – here was a sports photographer, denied his usual fare because of the pandemic, trying his hand at something very different. I was pleasantly surprised by the response, with far more people getting in touch than I’ve ever had for a sports story.\u0026nbspThe tulips died down, but sport was nowhere near a return. I needed something else and, fortunately, nature handed me another gift, a project that would test my photographic skills and give me the adrenaline buzz that I desperately missed from my normal job.Just as lockdown had fully kicked in around my north London home, I couldn’t help but notice two tiny birds flitting around my front garden. I was a complete bird novice. I knew robins, mainly because of Christmas cards, and other birds because they were nicknames of football teams – magpies, eagles, seagulls, canaries, etc. Every year I go with my family to the wildlife photography exhibition at the Natural History Museum and marvel at the pictures, amazed by the skill, technique and patience needed to create such beautiful images. Did it make me want to do similar? Not really, sport was my thing and I was happy with that.But these little birds kept grabbing my attention. We soon realised a nest was being built in the rose bush growing beside our front door. I had no idea what these birds were called, needing an uncle to identify them as long-tailed tits, Britain’s lightest bird and known as bum barrels. “You lucky things!” he said. These two were near-identical cute fluffballs with mainly black and white plumage tinged with bits of grey and pink. Only later, under close inspection of the photos, did I realise one had an orange eyeball, the other had yellow. They went everywhere together I read that long-tailed tits often went round in large groups as an extended family but these two were by themselves. I decided I might as well follow them, seeing if I could get a decent frame or two. This was my chance to be a bird photographer, at least for a while.At first it was really frustrating – I would see them on a branch but before I could focus they were off. They were so quick and seemed nervous of me. As for getting them in mid-air, their undulating and erratic flight seemed impossible to capture. I needed another approach: rather than chasing them around, I realised I had to be in place first and let them come to me. I began to learn their patterns of behaviour, noting routes they flew and places they visited. It reminded me of an approach I use in sports photography, getting to know “the hot zones”, areas where most action happens and the chance of success is greater. With these birds it tended to be near the rose bush, as they would always return there for nest building.To improve my chances of a better picture, I researched the birds expanding my knowledge of them could help me work out what they were doing. As I learned more about the birds I got closer to them. I started to get some half-decent images but all were of them sitting neatly on a branch or bush. I needed something a little more exciting and challenging, to show their character. Luckily for me they decided to provide exactly what I needed.For about three weeks during their nest building they would have sudden mood changes. Most of the time, when perched, they looked calm and cute, but then, out of the blue, they would become aggressive. They began flying into my front windows, repeatedly hitting the glass. I’d never seen anything like this before and no other birds were doing it. I guessed they must have been confused by the reflections off the glass, attacking the mirror image of themselves, thinking it was a rival bird threatening their new nest. I know it might sound a little cruel but I found it fascinating – and not bad for pictures.This behaviour could happen at any time during the day. We could be watching television when there would be a tap, tap, tap on the window – the angry birds. Sitting in my armchair I’d have a perfect view of the TV and the front window. There could be someone having their arm ripped off on the show Tiger King but my gaze was fixed elsewhere.Some days were much quieter. I’d be sitting, poised with camera, waiting for the birds, but nothing. That didn’t seem too bad if I was inside but I would also sit outside, tucked away behind my bins in a basic attempt to disguise myself, getting some very strange looks from passersby, obviously questioning my mental wellbeing. The hours would pass, time enough for me to wonder myself about my own sanity, then suddenly there would be a flurry of action. It reminded me of being at a cricket match, waiting ages for something to happen, then boom, drama all over in a flash.The birds seemed to have their favourite spots. Stretching across the street are a couple of old telephone wires, which they loved sitting on and bouncing in between. It gave them a perfect view down to the nest below and no other bird used them. It was part playground, part lookout, part bathroom and all theirs. Frequently, as the last rays of the setting sun hit the wires, the birds would wash themselves and dry off there.Looking at the nest it was easy to see why the long-tailed tit has been called the structural engineer of the bird world. These two put together an amazing rugby-ball shaped construction with a small entrance hole about three-quarters of the way up. It was built from hair, moss, cobwebs and lichen but, most ingeniously of all, with silk from spider cocoons which made the nest elastic and stretchy, so when it was full of growing chicks it could expand with them. Once the outside was made the two birds set about finding a stash of feathers – up to 2,000 can be used – to line the inside, making it soft for the eggs to be laid.When the nest was done the constant flying ceased. I presumed the eggs were laid as one bird would often stay behind, probably incubating, while the other found food. We loved it when we could see the bird’s head poking out of the nest entrance, watching the world go by. This pattern continued for quite a few days until I sensed something else was happening. I saw one of the birds with food in its mouth heading into the rose bush – a sure sign. Perched on top of a ladder I found a great view, in between branches straight through to the nest entrance which had a large pigeon feather pulled across, shielding the contents inside. The parent completely ignored me and poked its head inside – a tiny beak appeared.From then on, growth for the chicks was rapid, fuelled by the endless food shuttles the parents were doing. Backwards and forwards they flew, laden with various insects and grubs. The chicks quickly lost their reptilian looks, gaining feathers and fluffing up. The distinctive white line of the long-tailed tit was on their heads, like they had tiny Mohican haircuts. It may be a stereotypical scene, seen countless times on television, thrusting beaks of egg-yolk yellow, eager to grab food from a parent, but it still gave me goosebumps witnessing it right there in front of me.The chicks would desperately try to force themselves forward to the very edge of the entrance hole, hoping to be first in line for grub. This jostling of positions would often end up in squabbling and bickering – it struck a familiar chord with me. In between the regular feeds they would sleep, some with necks hanging right out of the nest, not wanting to lose their hard-earned priority position.Unsure of exactly when the first chicks were born, I had to guess the day they might start leaving the nest. Fledging time was approaching. One day I looked out and saw the first chick had ventured from the nest and on to surrounding branches. After about 20 minutes of washing itself and wobbling around, very unsure on its feet, it decided that was enough and headed back inside the nest. The next day I went out very early. Looking down to the ground I saw two chicks had tumbled eight feet from the nest down to the concrete paving.One was already dead, the other looked battered, shaken and groggy – a heartbreaking sight. We scooped up the injured one in a tiny bowl and placed it back in the rose bush. It was ignored by both parents – the question was, did these two chicks fall or were they pushed? Perhaps the nest got overloaded and they were forced out? I also started to think about my role. Should I be trying to save this chick? Was I interfering with nature? It’s obviously a frequent dilemma faced by many recording the natural world. The injured and scorned one fell out of the rose bush another couple of times, and each time we scooped it up and placed it back. After the fourth fall we had to make the decision to leave it to die. I was gutted. Another chick emerged from the nest and briefly wobbled around. Whether or not it saw its sibling lying on the paving below I can’t be sure, but it soon decided freedom was overrated and returned inside.The next morning, while eating breakfast, I heard a commotion from the nest, one much louder than the usual arguments. Going out I couldn’t believe it – the sweetest chicks you could ever imagine emerging from the nest and perched in the branches of the rose bush, seven in total. A mass wash and unfurling of feathers was happening, the chattering noise incredible. Gradually they found their balance and bravery, wandering around before, one by one, they summoned up the courage to take their maiden flights, in this case around three feet over to the privet hedge. Some just about made it some fell short, landing on a dustbin, window box or dwarf Christmas tree. One landed on my camera. Somehow they all managed to meet up in the privet hedge, where they began to mimic being back in the nest, squeezing together in a bundle of fluff and feather.That first night out they went to sleep, seven in a row, packed tightly on a branch in the privet hedge. But the next morning, they had gone. I looked for ominous signs, like loose feathers, fearful that a cat or fox had found them. Thankfully there were none.They had flown off and my feeling of responsibility had gone with them. I stood in my back garden, all around me a cacophony of tweets and squeaks as new wings were being tested out, but not the ones I was really interested in. Occasionally I spotted one of the parent birds in among all the others, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens and wood pigeons … and robins of course. Later that evening I saw one of our chicks in a tree near our bathroom window, looking tiny, out by itself in the wide, open world. But after that sighting I saw them no more. They were definitely gone.It has been said that sport has often played a vital role at times of crisis, battles on the pitch taking the nation’s mind away from battles off it. This time, it’s clear to me that nature has stepped up to take on the role of the great distractor. Thanks to this wonderful family of tiny birds, the natural world handed me solace and respite, helping me keep my sanity during this crazy spring. Thank you my beautiful bum barrels, I’ll never forget you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e0514778945b1a9201e649f0c22e7fa30544c3/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=427bb368b5ecb9d55da6343d763a6292","title":"lib dems unveil 150bn green coronavirus recovery plan","story":"Ed Davey says there is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity’ to reshape economyThe Liberal Democrats have unveiled proposals to invest £150bn in green projects over three years as a way to transform the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, warning that the government must act soon on the issue.Ed Davey, the party’s interim leader, said there was “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to both tackle potential mass unemployment due to Covid-19, and reshape the economy on more environmental lines.Labour has also announced ideas to rebuild the economy with measures such as training young people to work in green industries.Davey said Boris Johnson appeared to have not yet grasped the urgency of the situation.“You’ve got to have a very high level of ambition, and the way the government is talking about it, I’m not yet convinced their level of ambition is high enough,” he said. “With Johnson I think he may focus on some of the projects that get good headlines but not the ones we really need.”Davey’s proposals would involve investing £150bn in the green economy over the next three years, part of a total £350bn post-coronavirus rescue package.“If unemployment is going up anywhere near what people are saying, this is going to be absolutely essential,” Davey said.“There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to solve the massive crisis we’re in.”Properly insulating homes was vital for meeting existing green targets, Davey said, and could rapidly create jobs, with many local authority projects renovating social housing ready to go ahead. This would create jobs in supply chains, and help with those most affected by fuel poverty, he said: “So there’s a big social win there too.”For rewilding programmes, people could work on areas such as tree-planting and peat bog restoration.Other areas of the plan include a requirement for at least half of all Bank of England financing to go into green investment programmes, and a new system of government “climate bonds” to raise extra capital. People would also receive tax incentives on savings and pensions for investing in green areas.Labour has unveiled similarly ambitious plans, with the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calling for the creation of a “zero-carbon army of young people” doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies.Miliband has likened the task to the rebuilding process undertaken by Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, which involved the creation of the NHS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c22d79fa801b1371e7c19d545eeed7e34bbce6/0_290_4351_2611/master/4351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efeb2ba3d1e772bd3b0907660ff09a15","title":"scotland to ban mass culling of mountain hares","story":"Scottish parliament votes to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside ActGamekeepers and grouse moor managers will be banned from mass culling mountain hares after Scottish ministers bowed to intense pressure from conservationists.The Scottish parliament voted on Wednesday night to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, which will make it an offence to intentionally or recklessly kill or injure the hare without a licence.Conservationists and animal welfare groups were delighted with the decision, which came as MSPs voted to ban salmon farmers from shooting seals and introduced far tougher penalties for wildlife crime amongst a series of new animal protection measures.Bob Elliot, the director of the animal welfare charity OneKind, and a former wildlife crime investigator, said his organisation and others had been pressing Holyrood to protect mountain hares for several years.“Different reasons given by the grouse shooting industry for the supposed need to control mountain hares, such as the prevention of louping ill, a disease carried by ticks, have been successively discounted, and animal welfare has taken precedence,” he said.The measure was introduced by Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Green party MSP, as a late amendment to the animal protection bill and accepted on Wednesday night by Mairi Gougeon, the Scottish rural affairs minister.The mountain hare, which live in the Highlands and upland areas of southern Scotland and northern England, is widely seen as an emblematic species it turns white in winter to aid camouflage in the snow. Up to 25,000 are thought to be shot each year by grouse moor managers and gamekeepers on the grounds they carry ticks and diseases which harm young red grouse, and also feed on heather, shrubs and saplings.The joint nature conservation committee, an expert advisory committee to the UK government, told the EU last year that mountain hares were in “unfavourable inadequate conservation status”, partly due to a lack of data about their numbers.The Werrity report for the Scottish government, which recommended licensing of grouse moors last year, also said mountain hares required greater protection.Sarah-Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, which represents landowners, said: “These changes will not help Scotland’s wildlife, which is the prime concern of gamekeepers and land managers.“Mountain hares are thriving on Scotland’s moors and their fate will not be improved by this vote. There is clear evidence that the control of hares helps combat tick and Lyme disease and protect plants and young trees. Balanced wildlife management is key to meeting Scottish government targets on bioersity and tree planting.”Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: “A grave mistake has been made today. This is a bad law, made by people it will not impact upon.“There will be no satisfaction in turning around in a few years and saying: we told you so, but, certainly, this is an important date in the demise of another iconic species, killed by political trade-offs and emotive campaigns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29626a7d2225cc2ab24b972c6758ef4f0417ca19/0_96_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2471a37d5af01222543acf4b3a3f55","title":"worlds biggest liquid air battery starts construction in uk","story":"Exclusive: project will store renewable energy and reduce climate-heating emissions Construction is beginning on the world’s largest liquid air battery, which will store renewable electricity and reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants.The project near Manchester, UK, will use spare green energy to compress air into a liquid and store it. When demand is higher, the liquid air is released back into a gas, powering a turbine that puts the green energy back into the grid.A big expansion of wind and solar energy is vital to tackle the climate emergency but they are not always available. Storage is therefore key and the new project will be the largest in the world outside of pumped hydro schemes, which require a mountain reservoir to store water.The new liquid air battery, being developed by Highview Power, is due to be operational in 2022 and will be able to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours, and store power for many weeks. Chemical batteries are also needed for the transition to a zero-carbon world and are plummeting in price, but can only store relatively small amounts of electricity for short periods.Liquid air batteries can be constructed anywhere, said Highview’s chief executive, Javier Cavada: “Air is everywhere in the world. The main competitor is really not other storage technologies but fossil fuels, as people still want to continue building gas and coal-fired plants today, strangely enough,” he said.The UK government has supported the project with a £10m grant. The energy and clean growth minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “This revolutionary new facility will form a key part of our push towards net zero, bringing greater flexibility to Britain’s electricity grid and creating green-collar jobs in Greater Manchester.“Projects like these will help us realise the full value of our world-class renewables, ensuring homes and businesses can still be powered by green energy, even when the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing,” he said.The UK government is being urged to make the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic a green one. “We owe it to future generations to build back better,” said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to be planning a “green industrial revolution”.“There is likely going to be a need for one or more of the medium-to-long duration electricity storage technologies to fill a gap in the market, and liquid air energy storage (LAES) is right up there as an option,” he said. Pumped hydro is limited by the need for a mountain reservoir, while gravity storage – where you raise a weight and then let it drop to power a generator – is less developed, as is large-scale production of hydrogen fuel from green energy.“The combination of being more developed and more scalable provides LAES with an opportunity to be competitive, if they can prove that they can reduce costs with increased scale,” Buckman said.The Highview battery will store 250MWh of energy, almost double the amount stored by the biggest chemical battery, built by Tesla in South Australia. The new project is sited at the Trafford Energy Park, also home to the Carrington gas-powered energy plant and a closed coal power station.The project will cost £85m, and Highview received £35m of investment from the Japanese machinery giant Sumitomo in February. The liquid air battery is creating 200 jobs, mainly in construction, and employing former oil and gas engineers, with a few dozen in the continuing operation. The plant’s lifetime is expected to be 30-40 years. “It will pass to the next generation,” said Cavada.Highview is developing other sites in the UK, continental Europe and the US, including in Vermont, but the Manchester project will be the first. “The first one is definitely the most important and this is why we really value the UK government’s bold move to use UK technology to solve UK problems and afterwards export the tech globally,” said Cavada."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e16cab487e54b819addc1da39df0e1cf2e0206/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=61bbc16a1ebadfab74e17a11843ef353","title":"brian cox succession lockdown watch","story":"The actor has charity appeals ‘up the wazoo’, is enjoying raunchy Danish schoolteachers and longs to get back to shooting SuccessionI’ve been in a little cabin outside New York with my wife and sons since March.

The threat is more disturbingly intimate than you thought, or more disturbingly metaphorical. It’s an idea touched on in this elegant and mysterious psychological drama from Austrian film-maker Marie Kreutzer. Her trajectory of fear is not angled as you might think, towards a supernatural revelation or a down-to-earth explanatory twist or even an enigmatically balanced ambiguity between the two. For much of the time, The Ground Beneath My Feet has the uncanny-realist feel of something like Olivier Assayas’s Personal Shopper or Michael Haneke’s Hidden with its moment-by-moment portrait of emotional breakdown in the face of an unexplained phenomenon, and there’s something of Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann in its study of family dysfunction. But it seems to me different from all these: the transgressive threat approaches and recedes like thunder, leaving us with a study in loneliness.The person beneath whose feet the ground is shifting and disappearing is Lola (Valerie Pachner), a young corporate executive whose habit is to answer her mobile curtly with her surname (“Wegenstein”) as if always expecting a business call, nothing personal. Lola lives on her own in Vienna, through whose avenues she goes running every morning. She is driven, focused, goal-oriented and excited by an imminent business trip to Rostock in Germany, where her consultancy firm is about to land a big commission. Lola is also looking forward to hotel-room assignations with her boss, Elise (Mavie Hörbiger), with whom she is having a passionate affair, made more dangerous by the fact that Elise is in a position to advance her career, or – perhaps – to impede it by capriciously advancing others on her team.Something could yet ruin all this sleek sexual and professional gratification. Lola’s elder sister, Conny (Pia Hierzegger), who has paranoid schizophrenia – like their late mother – attempts to take her own life and is taken to hospital. Lola must frantically deal with this situation without ever confessing to the other yuppies that she has this family problem, that she is human like everyone else. Then she gets phone calls, apparently from Conny in hospital, accusing Lola of abandoning her and saying the nurses are abusing her. But wait. Conny is not allowed phone calls. Who and where are these calls coming from?Lola’s new crisis takes this movie to some subtle yet sensational set pieces of fright. Trying to keep it all together as best she can, Lola visits her doctor and confesses that she herself might be experiencing hallucinations. The weary, concerned doctor asks her a series of questions, the most important being whether she has a family history of mental illness. Kreutzer has Lola give an evasive answer before cleverly keeping the camera on her for the crucial next few moments. What is she hearing now? Whose questions are these? Is this interview making things worse?Kreutzer is very good at evoking the strangely dull, bland, identikit spaces of the mid-price business hotel, in which Lola is in her element. The film finds something inviting in the lobbies, the corridors with their tactfully subdued lighting, the bars and the restaurants in which various business meetings with tacky subtexts have to be negotiated. As Elise says to her, half accusingly, half teasingly: “You love hotels”. And she does. Their very emptiness and impersonality are liberating, and they are, after all, where she can have the best sex. In a hotel, there is no reminder of home, or family, or any of the things that she finds painful.And so the Conny situation, in all its pain and confusion, unfolds alongside an ugly confrontation in the office that reveals to Lola a toxic sort of sexual politics. Her importance in the team making this crucial presentation in Rostock seems to fluctuate, and she may or may not be justified in her suspicion that opening up to Elise about Conny will be a catastrophic mistake that would make her look weak and unreliable. Yet nothing is entirely clear, including the wisdom of Lola’s growing conviction that she might be able to save Conny by bringing her home to live with her. When Lola gets into a lift, and gets one of her unearthly phone calls from Conny at the same moment that the lift breaks down between floors, it brings a shiver of fear, and also of sadness.• The Ground Beneath My Feet is available on digital platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80c307780e595c631e028c281fd435deb010f18/316_216_1239_744/master/1239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f107b06b7bbfbf48281e225693eb2f0","title":"the wishmas tree review childrens animation eco adventure","story":"A new ice age threatens the world in this family film featuring cute creatures and a perplexing environmental messageBafflingly, this dull animated adventure with an Earth-hugging eco message has picked an impending ice age as the extreme weather event threatening its world with extinction – despite being made in Australia, a country heating faster than the global average.

But is that wise? John Harry was in the mood for chicken curry, so he walked two blocks from home to pick out a couple of birds.His destination was a squat warehouse surrounded by auto body shops, a scrapyard, and a school bus depot in the working-class neighborhood of Richmond Hill in Queens, New York. Inside was riotously loud, with the cries of chickens, duck, quail, guinea fowl and the tender pigeons known as squab, jostling for space and pecking seed in tall metal cages. In another room was a pen with lambs and goats butting heads and chewing alfalfa.The warehouse smelled powerfully of feathers and droppings, but Harry, a Guyanese construction worker in his 50s, seemed unfazed. He pointed out two broiler hens to a man in overalls who grabbed them, hung them by their legs from a scale, then carried them into a room strewn with feathers and drew a knife across their throats.“You can put your rice to boil, come get a chicken, be home before it burns,” Harry said. “Can’t get fresher than this.”The market he frequents, Madani Halal, is one of more than 80 in New York City that stock live animals and slaughter them on demand for customers. The markets are considered vitally important in many immigrant communities for cultural, religious or health reasons, contributing to the erse culinary landscape for which New York is famous. Since the 1990s the number of markets has nearly doubled, concentrated mostly in outer-borough immigrant neighborhoods. But since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have spread from a live animal market in China, a group of New York lawmakers has sought to shut these markets down, fearing that they pose a disease threat.Bills currently before the New York assembly and senate have requested an immediate moratorium on all live animal markets in the city. If passed, they would see the markets closed until a proposed new taskforce investigates concerns about public health and animal welfare in the sector.But critics of this plan, including researchers and community activists, say it unfairly targets immigrants, and is unlikely to reduce the risk of disease. They argue that it blurs issues of health and animal rights while overlooking the wider harms of industrial meat production.“This isn’t about food safety,” said Richard David, an activist from south Queens, home to a large number of the city’s live markets. “This is about food justice.”Some so-called “wet markets” in Asia, named for the common practice of hosing them down with water, stock exotic wildlife alongside live animals, providing a potential nexus for diseases to spread. This has led to growing calls around the world to ban them, even though the precise history of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, is still unclear.But the term “wet markets” has become confusing in the process, mixing up wildlife consumption with less exotic traditions, such as the poultry markets of New York. This has led to a situation where, in the rush to create a safer food system, culturally significant food practices, which pose comparatively minor public health risks, are coming under threat.In New York, animal rights groups have begun campaigning vigorously on issues of food safety, including staging protests outside markets. A recent petition by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urges officials to shut down “blood-soaked slaughterhouses” in New York, specifically referring to the facilities as “wet markets” in an accompanying video. Peta has also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to denounce live animal markets globally. The WHO has resisted these demands, saying that live markets provide food and jobs for millions of people.“Nobody is in favor of unsanitary markets,” said Nevin Cohen, a professor of public health at the Cuny Urban Food Policy Institute. “But instead of the kneejerk reaction of shutting them down, there are other policy tools, such as updating regulations or increasing enforcement.”These could include more frequent inspections and harsher penalties for non-compliance, he explained. “Banning these markets would eliminate some of the cultural ersity of our food system,” Cohen added. “It potentially sanitizes the city, in a bad way.”On a recent weekday morning, Awadh Radhakrishen, a parking garage attendant from Guyana, waited outside Madani Halal for his order. “You see everything here,” he told me. “You know what you’re eating.” But with supermarket chicken there was no way of telling, he said. “It might have been killed two weeks ago, two states away.”Live markets were a fundamental facet of New York’s culinary landscape until the rise of refrigeration in the 20th century. Modern supply chains physically distanced consumers from producers, increasingly shielding them from what the American food writer Michael Pollan has called “the shame of killing”. For this and other reasons, such as urbanization and rising incomes, meat consumption increased massively. At the same time, the harms of meat production multiplied, from toxic runoff at feedlots to the slaughterhouses that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, predominantly for low-paid immigrants and people of color.While that supply chain remains largely invisible, establishments like Madani Halal are wide open to public scrutiny. “It’s easier to pick on the little guy,” said Imran Uddin, the market’s owner.A big man with a full beard, Uddin left a career in advertising 20 years ago to take over the business from his father, a Bengali immigrant who began selling poultry in 1996. Uddin’s customers come from far and wide: the Caribbean, Latin America, China, south-east Asia. There are Punjabi Sikhs who buy and slaughter their own chickens, observing religious custom, and old Italian men from a different era in the neighborhood, when it was home mostly to European immigrants. “I see fewer of them each year,” Uddin said.Like all New York live markets, Madani Halal is licensed by the state department of agriculture and markets, subject to random inspections – of the animals and facilities – about once a month. Yet Uddin says he is in favor of even stricter regulation, conceding that some markets “cut corners”.According to the bill before the New York senate, inspectors have issued “a litany of violations” at live animal markets, including sidewalks with blood and feces and “allowing grime to accumulate on butchering equipment”.“Many of these markets can and should be improved,” said Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University. “But calls to eliminate them serve only to invoke disgust against the small practices of small people – while leaving intact the very large systems that are threats to health, animal welfare and the environment.”While organizations like Peta also campaign against industrial meat production, those corporations are vastly more powerful and less sensitive to activism.“If the alternative to these markets is mass-produced meat, we’re talking about displacing risk elsewhere, not reducing it,” said Cohen.Uddin recently drafted a petition for his customers, placing it on a clipboard at the cashier’s window. It reads: “I implore our representatives to reconsider the support for this new bill and empathize with the different cultural, ethnic and religious communities you represent.”So far, a few hundred people have signed, he said. Other customers had declined, wary of drawing attention to their immigration status. The petition by Peta has nearly 50,000 signatures. “People fear what they don’t know,” Uddin said.Uddin got into his truck and drove across the neighborhood with a delivery. Gousul Anwar, a Bangladeshi man who runs a dollar store in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was at home due to the pandemic he came to the door barefoot and in a shirt that read “Don’t panic”. He’d been buying meat from Uddin for more than 15 years, he said – and before that, from Uddin’s father. So had Anwar’s cousin, a slender man with a long beard who was sitting outside his apartment across the street. He waved and greeted Uddin warmly in Bengali. Both cousins were growing potted plants – tomatoes, peppers – fertilized with manure from Madani Halal.With only minor modifications, the scene resembled a kind of farm-to-table fantasy: the owner of a family business, delivering food and organic waste to customers he knew personally, providing a functioning, affordable alternative to the industrial meat system. Except in this case the participants weren’t virtuous middle-class shoppers, but working immigrants – “the fabric of New York”, Uddin called them afterwards.“They’ve left behind friends and family,” he said. “They work multiple jobs – the jobs Americans don’t want. And at the end of the day they want something that reminds them of home.“Those people are my customers,” he went on. “It disturbs me that people want to take this away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28351b63afcd2c9c0ff29867b634eeea67eaeea2/0_280_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ce031445c240f6cf8095ddbd5661ee1d","title":"everton among clubs chasing monster south korea defender kim min jae","story":"Kim Min-jae, the South Korea centre-half and one of the rising stars of football in Asia, is primed to move to the Premier League, with Everton having registered a firm interest and other clubs watching his situation.

A striker coveted by Bayern Munich and Liverpool will be wearing a blue shirt next season and, while Frank Lampard’s side still have to make sure they can offer their newest addition Champions League football, it is hard not to feel that Chelsea’s ruthless touch is returning after a tepid few years in the transfer market.The mood has changed. Six months ago Lampard cut a frustrated figure. He made it clear that he wanted attacking reinforcements after Chelsea’s transfer embargo was halved in December and struggled to hide his disappointment when nobody arrived in January. A team low on creative inspiration following the sale of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid needed an injection of class and Lampard’s concerns looked justified when Bayern won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in February.Chelsea have not made it past the last 16 of the Champions League since 2014 and are unlikely to improve that record when they visit Bayern for the second leg in August. Even so the growing sense is of a club on the up again, with the recruitment department and the head coach on the same wavelength and Roman Abramovich willing to provide funds to land key targets. Shortly after that quiet deadline day Chelsea agreed a £37m deal to sign Hakim Ziyech from Ajax in the summer and now they have pulled off another coup, sharpening their attack after winning the race for Werner.“It is a very proud moment for me to be joining this great club,” Werner told Chelsea’s website, which said he would link up with the squad in July, subject to a medical. That means, as anticipated, he will not play in the Champions League for Leipzig. Werner predicted “a very successful future” at Stamford Bridge.Whereas Bayern and Liverpool dithered, Chelsea pounced. They have paid £47.5m for Werner and, with the coronavirus pandemic potentially affecting budgets at other clubs, see an opportunity to make some decisive leaps. They have not used the £105m received for Hazard, Atlético Madrid are due to spend £48.5m to make Álvaro Morata’s loan permanent and further sales could boost the budget. All being well more new faces will follow Werner and Ziyech. Lampard wants Kai Havertz – a tricky one to pull off given that Bayer Leverkusen want at least €100m (£90m) for the 20-year-old winger – and likes the Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell.It could come down to choosing between Havertz and Chilwell. Both will be costly. Leicester are tough negotiators and although Chilwell fancies the move, Ajax’s Nicolás Tagliafico and Porto’s Alex Telles are cheaper alternatives at left-back.The most inexperienced manager in the Premier League has made some shrewd moves so far. He was wise to move on quickly after venting on 31 January and has protected his relationship with Marina Granovskaia, the powerful director. He played a key role in landing Ziyech, the gifted Moroccan playmaker, and also laid on the charm when it came to nabbing Werner, whose 32 goals in all competitions this season mark him out as one of the finest forwards in Europe.Ziyech has said that Lampard bombarded him texts to convince him to join, an approach that Werner will recognise. Before lockdown Lampard and Petr Cech, appointed as the club’s technical and performance adviser last summer, met Werner in Germany. They laid out their plans and struck up a rapport with the 24-year-old.Sources have said that Cech has been heavily involved in the deal. Cech and Lampard, teammates for a decade, combined to convince Werner. After a season of frustration in the final third, Chelsea have their marquee forward – a player capable of playing through the middle or of the left, with the ability to operate alone or in a two and the awareness to take and create chances. Although they could do with more oomph in central defence, there is no doubt that buying Werner is a step in the right direction.The German’s versatility will allow him allow him to play as a lone forward or work in tandem with Tammy Abraham or Olivier Giroud, and he keeps going when he misses chances. Werner comes back for more – no doubt there will be plenty of opportunities with Ziyech in midfield – and his determination to hit the ground running can be seen in his willingness to move to London in July and miss Leipzig’s Champions League quarter-final.It is a coup for Lampard, who inherited a squad in need of renewal last summer. He has given the kids a chance but Chelsea need more conviction. Although they have impressive options in central midfield, an overhaul is overdue in other positions. Willian and Pedro, both of whom are out of contract on 30 June, are coming to the end. There are doubts over Ross Barkley, Marcos Alonso, Jorginho, Emerson Palmieri and Michy Batshuayi. Tiémoué Bakayoko, a dud signing, has no future at the club.Chelsea must work hard to catch Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the league. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Christian Pulisic, young wingers with potential, are unproven. Mason Mount is learning and Ruben Loftus-Cheek is on his way back from a serious injury. Lampard should not settle if there are big deals to be done. Havertz, a target for Bayern, Madrid, Liverpool and United, would enhance his side’s threat.Do not rule out Havertz. Chelsea mean business. They have short-term targets to meet, a place in the top four to protect, but Lampard wants trophies. The spending is unlikely to stop with Werner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1b56ad1c8b5e9ee06c09da895e993fa329273f/0_138_4146_2488/master/4146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acf104cf272ef6a3fe3721d1853eb043","title":"kevin de bruyne runs the show in premier leagues successful return","story":"Manchester City’s midfield duke was sublime while Arsenal’s David Luiz had a night to forget at the EtihadWelcome back then, English football. Sport in the time of plague: this was never an easy prospect. In the event the Premier League’s live return was jarring, dream-like and lodged at all times on the spectrum between startlingly odd and startlingly everyday. Some things were reassuringly the same. Grass remains green. The ball is still round. And Mesut Özil didn’t turn up. Literally so on this occasion: Özil was left out of Arsenal’s match-day squad for the trip to Manchester City.Football even had something special for us. Not just an infuriating debate about technology, but an infuriating watch-buzzing goalline conspiracy theorist shemozzle, as Michael Oliver’s wristband failed to vibrate as the ball crossed the Aston Villa line in the night’s first match.Best of all there was even a little genuine exhilaration as, in between the strangulating protocols, and the sense of some formal dance being staged in no-man’s land, Kevin De Bruyne dished up his own little vision of the sublime on a rainy night in Manchester. It came from a standing start. The atmosphere at the Etihad was, of course, eerie and strange. But then the world is an eerie and strange place at the moment. Non-eeriness, an absence of strangeness: well, that really would be jarring.Pep Guardiola picked a strong team for City’s game in hand, the selection of a manager still with an eye on that condensed Champions League. Arsenal looked callow on paper. Mikel Arteta has spoken of his desire to create a spikier, more aggressive team, or at least one that is, to any noticeable degree, spiky and aggressive. He picked a commendably young, quick starting XI here, with Bukayo Saka, Joe Willock and Eddie Nketiah, 18, 20 and 21, in the front four.Otherwise this is an Arsenal team of odds and ends. Pablo Marí made his second league start and went off with an injured achilles. Granit Xhaka was also taken off on a stretcher early on, to be replaced by Dani Ceballos, who might have expected to be back in Madrid by now, but has instead become the football equivalent of an overdue library book.For a while Arsenal stifled City’s midfield and threatened their high defensive line. Steadily, though, something else began to happen. Mainly De Bruyne happened. Midway through the first half something just clicked, muscle memory kicking in, City’s midfielder duke timing his passes and his runs, turning a slightly frantic game a cool shade of blue.Some things are inisible, unaffected by the oddity around them. Extreme talent is one of them. David Luiz’s ability to flap wildly inside his own penalty area appears to be another. It was De Bruyne’s pass that led to the opening goal just before half-time, although David Luiz provided his own on-field welcome basket, producing a failed knee-trap that simply nudged the ball to Raheem Sterling close to goal. He smashed it across Bernd Leno and into the back of the net.De Bruyne kept on driving the game from the centre of the pitch. And four minutes into the second half David Luiz decided the game, dragging down Riyad Mahrez, conceding a penalty, earning himself a red card and completing a truly miserable – and these are some rare standards of misery – 26 minutes on the pitch. De Bruyne ked the kick into the corner.And that was pretty much that for a game that was just as much about the process of restarting this global show. At both games there was a genuinely moving minute’s silence before kick-off, no doubt felt very personally by some of those around the pitch. Since we were all last here 42,000 British people have died of this wretched viral bug, and many others of its ripple effects.The players at Villa Park and the Etihad also took a knee, a moment that felt unapologetically powerful. In Sofia last year Tyrone Mings played through horrendous racist barracking with grace, strength and tangible defiance. This is not simply a gesture. For now the rows of empty plastic seats seemed touching, a significant absence.No doubt we will get used to the TV presentation. At Villa Park the pitch-side pundits stood coolly apart, motionless as wedding cake figurines. At the Etihad the managers lined up in front of their advert boards for a long-range pre-match interview as though calmly facing down a firing squad.The lack of stadium noise offers a choice for the home viewer. The piped crowd sound on Sky was a vague, restless whooshing, like the sound of a seashell clasped to your ear, albeit a seashell filled with a billion football-obsessed sea microbes. The sea-microbes chuntered restlessly, occasionally joining in a shout, then dying back just as quickly.But it was on balance preferable to the real-life managerial shouting option. At the Etihad there were shrieks and screams. For long periods at Villa Park the noises-off suggested a lone spectator being thrashed with a piece of rope somewhere up in the eaves of the Holte End, bellows of manfully borne agony mixed with shouts of “our ball” and “corner”.City’s 3-0 victory was crowned by a goal from Phil Foden, and marred by the worrying sight of Eric García being carried off after colliding with Ederson.Otherwise this was a successful return, both for the Premier League itself and for City, who played their own kind of physical-distance football, easing through the Arsenal midfield without contact or collisions and looking, on this evidence, like a team ready to run to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78edf4effe4255b3f138c1ff96abab0eac49e1f6/280_240_2933_1760/master/2933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f93a341638fdc4977cfe67ff29a6105","title":"mario balotelli v massimo cellino and a homecoming that turned sour","story":"The striker’s return to the town where he grew up has become a battle between him and the local club’s owner, Massimo CellinoMario Balotelli’s stomach ache returned over the weekend. The Brescia striker had only been allowed back into his club’s training base last Wednesday after six days off with gastroenteritis. He was scheduled for a pair of inidual workouts on Saturday but left the facility after completing the first, having suffered an apparent relapse. A post on his Instagram Stories simply said: “Sick.”Hours earlier, he had shared a video of himself on the same platform, still sweating from the morning practice session. “Stop asking if I’m going to training or not,” he said. “I’m going to training guys. I have always been training.”He has not done it with his teammates, though, since early March. When Serie A clubs were given the green light to resume training last month, Balotelli was notably absent from Brescia’s group work. The club’s owner, Massimo Cellino, told the BBC World Service: “He doesn’t show up to training, he doesn’t look very committed, let’s say, for the future of the club.”The question of who was responsible for such non-attendance may finish up in court. Cellino began proceedings this month to have Balotelli’s contract terminated for just cause, an extraordinary step when you consider that it was already likely to expire this summer. The one-year deal Balotelli signed last August would automatically be extended if Brescia avoided relegation, but they are bottom of Serie A, with nine points to make up in 12 games.The picture painted by the club is of a player who opted out. Asked by the newspaper Corriere della Sera why Balotelli was not training with the first-team squad, Brescia’s manager, Diego López, blamed a failure to engage during lockdown with online training tools provided by the club.“It was optional, OK, but the rest of the group took one path and he took the other,” said López. “During quarantine, on Zoom, he did not show himself. Even if he says he is in good shape, he is not on the level of his teammates.”Balotelli has not spoken so directly on the matter, but his social media posts and brief interactions with the press suggest that he feels unfairly excluded. After his first bout of gastroenteritis, he sought to resume training at Brescia’s facility on 9 June, but was turned away at the gates – apparently because he had not updated the club early enough about his recovery. As he trudged back to his car, he was heard protesting: “Then they say that I won’t train.”The dispute has other threads. Balotelli has initiated legal action against Brescia over unpaid wages from March. His agent, Mino Raiola, accused the club of failing to put Balotelli through a mandatory Covid-19 test. Brescia defined that latter claim as “false and slanderous”, warning that their legal team had been instructed to pursue the matter in the relevant chambers. Balotelli has been invited to give his account to an Italian Football Federation hearing on Thursday.How did it come to this? Balotelli’s move to Brescia was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming, a rare talent – albeit one whose potential had never been fully realised – returning to the town where he grew up, to play for the team he once served as a ballboy. The Rondinelle (Little Swallows) had just been promoted to the top flight after eight years outside it. They believed Balotelli could deliver the goals to keep them there.He is the club’s top scorer this season but five goals in 19 games are hardly transformative. In a tale familiar from too many other stops in his career, Balotelli has sparkled only intermittently, serving up brilliant goals against Verona and Lazio but failing to leave a mark on other occasions. Two of Brescia’s four wins so far this season arrived while he was still serving out a suspension picked up at his previous club, Nice.Were the expectations on him always unrealistic? Brescia’s squad are not without talent – the 20-year-old midfielder Sandro Tonali is one of Italian football’s brighter prospects – but lack the depth to thrive at this level. Cellino’s impatience has not helped, either. He fired Eugenio Corini as manager in November, replacing him with Fabio Grosso for three games before swapping back. Corini lost the job again in February, this time being replaced by López.It is not easy for any player to adjust constantly to different managers with different ideas about how the game should be played, but the changes can only feel more acute for one who tends to be singled out for special treatment. Grosso threw Balotelli out of a training session and excluded him from a trip to Roma. López gave him the captain’s armband.On top of all this, Balotelli also found himself back at the centre of Italian football’s continuing struggle with racism. He was subjected to monkey chants during the defeat at Verona and responded by kicking a ball at the perpetrators. The opposition manager, Ivan Juric, and president, Maurizio Setti, ridiculously insisted no racist abuse had taken place.That claim was contradicted by independent observers but, even then, the partial stadium closure handed down as a punishment was appealed into a suspended sentence. One ultra was banned from attending games by Verona after telling a local radio station that, in his eyes, Balotelli could never be “fully Italian”.Even in Brescia’s own stadium, Balotelli has been targeted. A game against Lazio was interrupted as the PA and the visitors’ manager, Simone Inzaghi, implored away fans to stop making racist chants.Then there were Cellino’s remarks in November. Asked about Grosso’s decision to drop Balotelli, the owner replied: “What can I say? That he’s black and he’s working to whiten himself but he has great difficulties in this.”It was defended by some as a play on words – “nero”, the Italian word for “black” is sometimes used as an adjective to stress a deep level of anger – but Cellino refused even to acknowledge that his phrasing could have upset anyone.Only Balotelli can know how greatly these incidents did or didn’t affect him. From the outside looking in, we can only observe the broad arc of what can feel at times like a story stuck on repeat: optimistic beginnings giving way to a fractious end.In the lexicon of Italian football, “stomach ache” has frequently been used as a euphemism for a player’s desire to change clubs: a call-back to Zlatan Ibrahimovic telling a reporter that his questions were causing him such symptoms during his final season at Inter. Balotelli could find worse models than the Swede for how a striker can continue to reinvent themselves into a fourth decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/173cdf55f45773b84b2ec701e8f93947e46143cd/0_17_2142_1286/master/2142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b71b0f3889ae53d610be09a57b23a77","title":"little orpheus games review","story":"It’s a bit fiddly on your phone, but guiding Soviet cosmonaut Ivan through lush jungles and forgotten cities is still a lot of funMac, iPhone, iPad The Chinese RoomSumo DigitalFollowing a diminutive cosmonaut on an unexpected journey to the centre of the Earth, Little Orpheus is a madcap Soviet adventure story with the panache of a great Saturday-morning cartoon from the 80s. By swiping and tapping the screen, you guide little Ivan Ivanovich through a secret underground kingdom of lush jungles, forgotten cities and intimidating megafauna, listening as he colourfully recounts his mishaps to a sceptical, beefy military interrogator wondering where he’s been for the last three years. The art, music and narration are all top-notch, enlivening the voyage with humour, beauty and the odd moment of wonder. It’s been a while since I had such a positive time staring at my phone.Little Orpheus is scarcely more complicated than the 80s classic, Pitfall!, requiring little more from the player than running from left to right and jumping at the right times. But from these simple actions, developer the Chinese Room constructs humorous, exciting scenes. In the first episode you’re dashing behind rocks to evade the beady, amber eye of a T rex by the fourth, you’ve discovered a new species of humanoid and ventured through the squelchy innards of a whale (“A glade of polyps and globules!” enthuses Ivanovich). Each of the eight episodes, which are about the length of the average commute, takes you to a different splendid location. The art is top-notch, with vibrant colours that recall old sci-fi adventure novels and a jaunty, orchestral score adds cinematic verve to Ivanovich’s antics.Such a grand adventure is not optimally suited to the dimensions of a phone screen. The vistas are better enjoyed on an iPad or a Mac, when your fingers don’t obscure so much of them. I found that my gestures were sometimes confused, sending Ivan flying from a dangling rope to his death rather than shimmying up it, but I was having such fun that I hardly minded having to replay a few sections because of a fat-fingered fumble. The final episodes are more demanding and, therefore, more frustrating, but have courage, comrade – this is a journey that’s worth seeing through.• Little Orpheus is available now on Apple Arcade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eea7bef72fa35bc81fa73b12bb23f585bbdb0cb/0_0_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e4d4e0d9676ea8953393f41cafe6db65","title":"covid clearout charity shop lockdown coronavirus scope communities","story":"Many of us have missed the likes of Scope just as much as Primark or John Lewis. We spend a day with happily returning customers, donors and staffThere’s a new purple wheelie bin on Walthamstow High Street in north-east London, outside No 210, and it’s filling up fast. Michael Armstrong and Louise Craven have just put a bag of books in. “We’ve got several bags from lockdown tidying and we’re going to bring it in one bag at a time,” says Michael. He doesn’t sound like he’s from north-east London. Because he isn’t – he’s originally from California. He came here 40 years ago, “for the weather”, says Craven, his partner, drolly.Her irony maybe backfires a little today. It’s a glorious day in Walthamstow – the high street is pretty much Sunset Boulevard minus the palms.Among the books is what Armstrong describes as “some rather odd poetry journals”, a study of American architecture and The Glass Room by Simon Mawer, which they have both read and recommend.They’re not getting thrown away but recycled, hopefully reread. Because No 210, set between a betting shop and a fish bar, is a charity shop belonging to Scope, the national disability charity. This week, like other non-essential retailers, charity shops in England were able to open for the first time in almost three months, to customers and for donations.Another bag goes into the purple bin. This one contains a brown jacket from Ben Odamtten, who says it’s too small for him. There’s also a card holder and two pairs of shades in his bag. And I have donated a couple of bags, mostly of outgrown children’s clothes. I wanted to bring the popcorn machine, too, but my family wouldn’t let me. No one needs a popcorn machine.Scope’s area manager, Lara Woolston, explains the new process. Donations go from the purple bin into heavy-duty bin bags, which are labelled with the date, tied up with giant rubber bands, taken to a room above the store and left for 72 hours to minimise any risk of infection. Safety of staff, volunteers and customers is Scope’s priority, I’m told, often.The acting shop manager, Celia Mullins, is up here, busy clearing out bays that can be filled in date order. Quarantine for donated clothes, books, CDs, sunglasses etc is going to be stricter and better organised than it is for arrivals at UK airports. There’s already a lot of stuff up here, but if it fills up there is an overflow storage unit in Barking.They have done a lot on the shop floor, too, putting in all the necessary safety measures. It has all been unmuddled and decluttered the rummage boxes – with things, such as toys, that kids would play with – have been removed from the floor. “We’re trying to limit the number of times people need to touch things,” says Woolston.Fitting room? Not any more – it’s taped off like a crime scene. Buy it if it doesn’t fit, bring it back. And there’s a one-way system, with arrows on the floor, plus “sneeze screens” at the tills. Customers are offered hand sanitiser along with a mask and gloves on entering. “It’s been a long time since we’ve been able to welcome our wonderful community through our doors,” says Woolston. For the moment though, they are only allowing one person – or one family – in at a time.It’s the same story across the whole sector: the pandemic makes no allowances for good causes. The chancellor Rishi Sunak’s £750m bailout fund for charities didn’t come close to replacing lost income, not just because of shops being closed but also because of the cancellation of other means of fundraising – the London Marathon and the Great North Run to name two massive ones. Street-funding, too, as well as the possibility that people are more likely to give to NHS charities at the moment. A study published last week found that one in 10 charities faces bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle with a £10bn shortfall caused by a perfect storm of massive income reduction and rocketing demand for their services. “It’s been a devastating loss of income,” Scope’s head of retail, Debbie Boylen, tells me over the phone. “Because it’s been at a time when disabled people need us the most.”I could have spent the morning at any charity shop and the picture would have been similar. I’ve come to Scope simply because it’s where we usually bring stuff to. That said, my local branch isn’t among the first wave of 16 shops around the country opening as lockdown eases, so I’ve travelled across London. Hence just the two bags: there’s plenty more to come at home, under the stairs, from our own Covid clearout. Boylen thinks it’s not just us. “Everybody I speak to is saying the same, that they’ve been clearing out cupboards and wardrobes over the past few months.”Each bag is worth, on average, £20 to Scope 81 bags would, for example, allow it to run its Parents Connect support programme, for parents and carers of young disabled people in Leeds, for a week.The bin is soon full, the contents bagged up and taken up to Mullins to be placed in quarantine. This system for dropping stuff doesn’t allow gift aid to be claimed for donations, says Woolston, so they miss out on that, but it’s unavoidable with the only-one-in-the-shop policy. That may be relaxed, but for now gift aid donors can’t be expected to queue.As well as the purple wheelie bin, that’s the other new thing outside No 210: a queue. Beautifully spaced, orderly, patient, not as long as the ones outside Asda and Lidl down the street but undeniably a queue. It seems the appetite not just to donate but to shop in charity shops is alive and well. “I’ve missed it,” says Shahnaz Khan, one of the first people in. “You can get so many nice things from here, and the people are very nice.” She comes out with a pink handbag.Alan Donoghue, who used to work here and is queuing on a mobility scooter, says it’s a good way to pass the morning. “It does you good mentally, and also sometimes there might be stuff that you want.” He’s not after anything specific, though he’s always on the look out for tea towels, fridge magnets and commemorative plates.Is anyone here for something specific, Woolston asks the queue. “Tennis racket,” says a man named Mike Anderson. He tells me he’s started playing a bit in order to start seeing people. He has been borrowing his friend’s girlfriend’s racket but now is the time to take responsibility. Two minutes later, Woolston is back out of the shop with a choice of two: Anderson opts for the more expensive, a Slazenger for a fiver. The deal is done on the street. “Probably illegally,” laughs Woolston.Anderson is chuffed enough with his purchase. “Charity shop, so, you know, standards are slightly lower,” he says. “But it looks lovely, it’s got its own cover if anybody saw me walking towards a tennis court they would think I was going to play tennis, which is half the battle won, isn’t it?”Nina Bright doesn’t shop anywhere but charity shops, except for socks and underwear. So she hasn’t bought any clothes for three months. She’s just happy to be out looking and isn’t bothered about the queue. “It’s fine – I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. Nor is she bothered that, once she does get inside the shop, she doesn’t find anything to buy. She dismisses it as “the lottery of thrifting”.Maybe Odion Edgal will be more successful. She’s on the hunt for books she ran out over lockdown. “I miss books a lot – I need something to read.” She finds something – not Armstrong and Craven’s odd poetry journals or American Architecture, but Camp David, David Walliams’s 2012 autobiography. For £2. “That’s why I come – I can’t afford to go to Waterstones.”There have been 56 bags of donations in Walthamstow. Not quite enough for a week of Parents Connect, unless there are some treasures in there – a Mulberry handbag perhaps – and Woolston and Mullins won’t know for another couple of days, when they can open up the bags. Maybe those poetry journals will turn out to be rare treasures and can be sold at auction for millions. Maybe.It’s going to pick up further as more charity shops open and people realise this, and then get their acts together to get down there. I know of several bags destined for a purple bin in the near future one of them might just have a kitchen gadget snuck in there. Maybe someone does need a popcorn maker – just not me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07de3d4e5a99b09873b75b434511ad1b87040e56/0_35_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61629db6887876ac34a49894fcd97ecc","title":"stranded at sea crew members trapped on cruise ships","story":" US reporter Erin McCormick describes why thousands of crew are still stranded on cruise ships after coronavirus bought the industry to a standstill in March.

This is the story of how its invention went on to change the world“The best thing since sliced bread.” We’ve all heard the saying. It’s synonymous with greatness, a new invention, a game-changer. But the road to greatness is seldom easy.Sliced bread was first sold in July 1928, in a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri. The bakery used an automatic bread-slicing machine invented by jeweller Otto Rohwedder. It had been hard work to get to that point: Rohwedder had tried for some time to introduce the US to sliced bread. He’d carried out extensive market research, surveying tens of thousands of people on the perfect thickness of a slice. And his prototype machine and all his blueprints were lost to a fire in 1917.Despite grumbling from the baking industry, which voiced concerns about his new-fangled idea, the concept became a hit. The Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune hailed the “thrill of pleasure” that a housewife would get at no longer having to carve up a whole loaf. “So neat and precise are the slices, and so definitely better than anyone could possibly slice by hand with a bread knife that one realises instantly that here is a refinement that will receive a hearty and permanent welcome,” it said. The page was topped with a slogan describing the invention as: “The greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped” – the phrase that became today’s “greatest thing since sliced bread”.But Rohwedder’s creation wasn’t an instant hit. Pre-sliced loaves went stale faster than whole loaves, and some shoppers also felt they were “sloppy looking”. Rohwedder wasn’t deterred. He produced u-shaped pins to hold loaves together, so they looked more appealing.Yet it still wasn’t plain sailing for the humble sliced loaf. As soon as they got used to their easier-to-use bread, Americans were robbed of it. In early 1943 the government banned it, citing the war effort, with steel for bread-slicing machines required for weaponry, and the thick wax paper also needed for more important uses. “The ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out,” US food administrator Claude R Wickard told the New York Times. “So, the order prohibiting the slicing of bread is aimed at affecting economies in the manufacture of bread and in the use of paper.”Fast forward to 2020 and sliced bread is now commonplace worldwide. Like any great invention, its history is full of highs and lows, victories and losses, innovation and invention.

In the end, they transformed computing as we know itWhen legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov found himself beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer, it was seen as a seminal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence.It was New York, 1997 and for the first time ever a computer had beaten a world champion under tournament conditions. This was the culmination of a journey in which the first stirrings of what we now call artificial intelligence and machine learning were born. A road trodden by war heroes and student researchers alike, whose singular desire to create a program that could beat the very best in the world would shape an entire science.Early originsChess lends itself well to computer programming. Where other games can depend more on gut instinct or physical skill, chess is a game of strict binary rules – a move is either correct or it isn’t.It’s a game where multiple permutations, strategies and responses to moves and gambits could all be pre-programmed. Teaching a computer how to select the best option from those available to counter a problem, though, was the tricky part, and that’s where machine learning came in.Given the close relationship between chess, logic and programming it’s no surprise that the driving forces of early computerised incarnations of chess were academics whose love of the game dovetailed with their desire to push the boundaries of the burgeoning field of computer science.One of those academics was Alan Turing. He may have made his name breaking Nazi ciphers at Bletchley Park, but he also helped lay the early groundwork for computerised chess too. In 1947, while working at the University of Manchester, Turing developed the first simple algorithm that was capable of analysing an opponent’s move one step ahead. Four years later, his academic colleague DG Prinz wrote a program that could solve particular moves, but not play a game.Competitive gamesThe 1960s saw computer chess start to come into its own. In 1967, MacHack VI, a program written by MIT student Richard Greenblatt, was able to draw a game in a US Chess Federation tournament, losing four. But this was just the start and its results began to improve.New York City hosted the first US computer championship in 1970 it was won by Chess 3.0, a program put together by a team from Northwestern University.And in 1988, HiTech, a computer developed at Carnegie Mellon University, defeated grandmaster Arnold Denker, in a match. In the same year, another Carnegie Mellon program, Deep Thought, defeated top-notch grandmaster Bent Larsen in a tournament game.Humans strike backDeep Thought’s defeat of Larsen was a huge moment for early AI. But this success was short-lived – the program was easily bested later that year by Garry Kasparov.This setback prompted the team behind Deep Thought to push further and further to refine their model. In their view, Kasparov’s success was simply check – but it wasn’t check mate. The team’s success caught the eye of US computer giant IBM, which brought them aboard as part of a dedicated chess programming group tasked with devising a way to beat Kasparov and they developed a successor to Deep Thought called Deep Blue. It incorporated a sophisticated new multiprocessing system that enabled it to consider as many as 50bn positions in three minutes, about a thousand times faster than Deep Thought’s system.Kasparov vs Deep BlueDeep Blue made its professional chess-playing debut in a six-game match with Kasparov in Philadelphia in February 1996. A bumper $500,000 prize and IBM covering the match on its website – the web was still in its infancy back then – helped draw huge media attention.Deep Blue won the first game, but Kasparov adapted his tactics to win three and draw two of the remaining games to win the match 4–2.But in a six-game rematch held in May 1997 in New York City, an upgraded Deep Blue was able to consider an average of 200m positions a second, twice its previous speed. Its algorithm was also improved with input from human grandmasters.Kasparov played smart though, he was conservative with his moves which threw Deep Blue off balance – it hadn’t expected it. But after resigning the second game even though it was drawable, the Russian said he never recovered mentally. With the match tied at one win, one loss, and three draws, Deep Blue won the decisive final game in 19 moves.Influence on AIThe lessons learned from the desire to create a program that could beat a human chess champion enhanced AI.Murray Campbell, one of IBM’s top AI experts, originally worked on the Deep Thought and Deep Blue projects. He now works on artificial neural networks and credits the quest to master chess programs with helping his team understand the importance of identifying the differences between how humans and machines think, but also in how they’re similar.Efforts to master chess, though, still continue to drive the development of AI. One of the criticisms of Deep Blue and subsequent machines is that they relied on the “brute force” application of their superior memory skills – they could remember more permutations than a human. They could out-calculate, rather than out-think.AI company DeepMind’s algorithm AlphaZero set out to change that. It could teach itself how to play chess and learn from its own mistakes. Not only that, it was able to play with intuition and finesse, destroying the reigning artificial chess champion Stockfish during a match in 2017. It played like a human and at times appeared to even toy with its opponent before delivering a killer blow.Even now, the desire for the perfect tech-mate is continuing to push the boundaries of AI.Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

He replied: “Do you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.“I’ve got say, on this take the knee thing – which, I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones – feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it’s a matter of personal choice.”It is not clear why Raab believed the pose comes from Game of Thrones, the popular TV fantasy series.It in fact began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.Kaepernick, who was joined by some other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans.Kaepernick’s actions saw him frozen out of professional sport, amid criticism from Donald Trump and others. He could now return to the NFL, with even Trump saying this would not be a problem for him.Asked if he would take the knee to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter, Raab said he would not, adding: “I’d take the knee for two people – the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.”On the subject of his wife he added: “By the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I’m sure I did, but we’d obviously had too much Champagne at the time. But I’m certain I did.”Raab’s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism – and some mockery – for saying that he had only recently appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing for UK trade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232f6ab9d1b5c024b516757c9144279c7ae081b5/0_196_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aac40ea10eae10afd4aba4be8abedc4","title":"how cephalopod cells could take us one step closer to invisibility podcast","story":"Watching the mesmerising patterns of squids, octopuses and cuttlefish has been the catalyst for much of Dr Alon Gorodetsky’s recent work, including his attempts to mimic their ability to become transparent.

A senior member of staff at St Mungo’s, one of the charities leading the Everyone In initiative, said that if they return to the streets “people will die”.Unless officials waive a restriction on foreign nationals with a limited immigration status known as “no recourse to public funds”, about half those currently housed could end up back on the streets, charities told the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, in an open letter signed by around 100 homelessness organisations.“We are dismayed that extended housing support will only be available to those who qualify for welfare benefits,” the letter, coordinated by the campaign group Citizens UK, said.Neil Parkinson, a senior case worker with the homelessness charity Glass Door, added: “Migrants who live and work here legally are often not able to access housing support. They will find a huge challenge to access the private rental sector, especially if they have lost their jobs.”Since lockdown was announced in March, more than 5,400 rough sleepers have been placed in Holiday Inns, Travelodges and Ibis hotels all over of England. Similar schemes are in operation elsewhere in the UK. But there has been growing concern about what happens once initial funding runs out.Many hotels were only booked by local authorities for three months and without a further guarantee of funding, some councils will be forced to find alternative housing for rough sleepers imminently. Dominic Williamson, an executive director at St Mungo’s, which has supported about 2,700 rough sleepers during lockdown, said the scheme had been “a tremendous success” which could be reversed if new housing was not found swiftly.“Without further financial help, councils tell us they may not be able to keep people in hotels for much longer. It is my very real fear that people will die,” he said.Staff working with rough sleepers at the two hotels in east London that have now stopped accommodating rough sleepers said around 70 people had been housed in the two buildings. Around 20 residents were moved to another hotel in Hammersmith charity staff who had been working with the hotels’ inhabitants were told by officials that nobody had ended up back on the street, but they said this was difficult to verify and they were uncertain about where the rest had been rehoused.Several other London hotels are due to close in the next three weeks, but staff have expressed concern that they will not be able to find alternative suitable accommodation for inhabitants. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said:“We’ve been clear that councils must continue to provide safe accommodation to all vulnerable rough sleepers and support those moving on from emergency accommodation in the right way, to ensure their needs are met.“Our new rough sleeping taskforce is ensuring that as many people as possible who have been brought in off the streets in this pandemic do not return to sleeping rough.“To help achieve this, we have provided £3.2bn for councils to help meet Covid-19 pressures on top of specific funding for rough sleeping services. And we have accelerated plans– backed by £433m – which will deliver 6,000 additional homes for former rough sleepers across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ba032af22fe83066982825212109f69af1ff93/0_203_4533_2720/master/4533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77d1322211ccd7477d4e1149eb1a820","title":"rendez vous redux lomu v catt and when norway ruled the world","story":"Plus: Arnold Palmer’s US Open charge at Cherry Hills, triple jump joy, Moeen magic and more speed thrills1) Claude Lelouch’s 1976 single-take short C’etait un rendez-vous is a speed-freak favourite, chronicling a pigeon-scattering, traffic-light ignoring dawn drive through Paris. Lelouch has returned behind the camera for a new version, with less mystique, F1 driver Charles Leclerc at the wheel, Ferrari, face coverings, elbow bumps and even Albert II, Prince of Monaco, on board. Stick with the classic, we reckon.

Two goals in four minutes – Hege Riise threading the needle to find the corner and a bundled Marianne Pettersen effort – proved the difference. Fifa’s short film on the tournament delightfully evokes the women’s game’s pre-primetime era.4) But a quarter of a century is nothing: it’s 60 years today since Arnold Palmer’s sensational comeback at the US Open – he went into the final round seven strokes off the lead, but tore up Cherry Hills with a brilliant round of 65 to finish two clear of then-amateur Jack Nicklaus.

It’s already been an excellent week for him, considering he’s only had nine rides in total at Ascot and one of the losers was Maydanny, first home on the wrong side in the Silver Hunt Cup.James Doyle had the biggest Wednesday, bagging the Prince of Wales as well as a win in the Queen’s colours, while Oisin Murphy and Andrea Atzeni got themselves on the podium. Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori has had a few frustrations since the exhilaration of Frankly Darling, being on the wrong Gosden runner in yesterday’s big race and getting done on the line aboard First Receiver. His chance of being top jockey this week has halved since Tuesday morning, according to the betting.1.15pm Golden Gates HandicapTritonic 15-21.50pm Wolferton StakesWalkinthesand (nb) 40-12.25pm Jersey StakesMonarch Of Egypt 9-23.00pm Chesham StakesBattleground 5-23.35pm Gold CupMoonlight Spirit 9-14.10 Britannia HandicapGreat Ambassador (nap) 12-14.40pm Sandringham HandicapAfrican Dream 7-4Annoyingly, the price has crashed in the past 24 hours about Great Ambassador, who was a 20-1 shot at 4pm on Wednesday! There will be full advice, with up-to-date analysis taking into account the crucial change in ground conditions, in our previews before every race today.On Ladies’ Day, the traditional flutter for racegoers in the build up to the action is the colour of the Queen’s hat, and I’ve been told that in the absence of the Royal Procession, Bettingexpert have put together a fun set of odds for ITV Racing’s Francesca Cumani’s headpiece. The guide prices are 2-1 Purple, 3-1 Green, 4-1 Blue, 6-1 Red 8-1 White, Grey and Black, 10-1 Orange, 25-1 Union Jack and 33-1 No Hat. We’ll have the result soon after ITV Racing are out of the stalls at 1.30pm!There was some precipitation at the meeting in 1971 ... when Rock Roi won (this Pathe newsreel is a hoot) the Gold Cup but was later disqualified after failing a dope test.There’s nothing like a bit of rain to send betting markets into turmoil and punters seem certain the 13mm that fell on Ascot this morning has made the Gold Cup more competitive. Technician, an 11-2 shot overnight, has shortened to a best price of 100-30 while Straarius has gone the other way, from 4-7 to 5-6, despite having some top-class form to his name on soft.There have been interesting movements in the other round-course races, with Global Storm, a winner on heavy last year, going favourite for the opening handicap. And of course this is very much Sir Dragonet weather, the Irish raider having never looked so good as when sluicing through the Chester mud in spring last year. He’s taken over at the top of the betting for our second race, the Wolferton, and while some of that support will be the result of a ‘Pricewise’ tip in the Racing Post, he has tightened from 11-4 to 9-4 since 8.30am. The effect of the rain will probably be less on the straight course but it’s interesting to see some opposition to the supposed handicap ‘good thing’ in the last, African Dream, whose ability to cope with soft must be taken on trust. Waliyak, who put up a big effort on heavy last year, is 13-2 from 10-1 since last night.There will be a further update on the going at Ascot after Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, has walked the track again at around 10.30, but it was still raining when he recorded his first report at 8.30am, which arrived on Ascot’s Twitter feed a few minutes ago.“We’ve had 11m of rain since racing yesterday and it’s now about 8.30 in the morning,” Stickels said, “and the going has changed to good-to-soft. It’s still raining lightly so it will possibly go to good-to-soft, soft in places on the round course. We’ll update when I walk the course again at around 10.30 to 11.00.“The forecast is for further possible showers today and then tomorrow and Saturday look like two drier days with only the occasional risk of a shower.”John Gosden, meanwhile, has been on ITV’s Opening Show to confirm – as only he can – that Straarius will definitely line up for the Gold Cup despite the softening ground.“There’s little you can do about it but he loves to cruise … on fast summer ground and then put in that electrifying turn of foot which deals with his opponents,” Gosden said. “I think it’s a bit what Muhammad Ali said, he won’t be able to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee today, I’m afraid with the ground, it’s more likely to be rope-a-dope.Congratulations to melonk who won Wednesday’s competition ... for the second year in a row! The Talking Horses veteran had both the 12-1 shots that scored yesterday, Sir Busker and Hukum, for a final score of 19. That was impressive but not quite so good as 12 months ago, when melonk’s winners were Raffle Prize (18-1), Southern Hills (7-1) and Dashing Willoughby (6-1). BraileyC went close yesterday on +16.33, while MISTERCHESTER had three winners for +12.Please post your tips or racing-related comments below.The rainclouds that threatened but largely failed to deliver on Tuesday and Wednesday finally dumped some serious rain on Ascot after racing yesterday, and the effect on Straarius’s price to become only the third horse in history to win the Gold Cup three times has been dramatic.So far, the course has taken 13.2mm of rain since midnight, more than enough to change the official going to good-to-soft all over with every chance of further deterioration as the day goes on. That is very bad news for backers of Straarius, who remains odds-on for today’s feature race – but only just.It’s true that the ground was officially soft, good-to-soft in places when Straarius won his second Gold Cup last year, with a GoingStick reading of 7 on the straight course and 5.7 on the round course before racing, but it was drying all the time (and changed to good-to-soft all over after the Gold Cup).The GoingStick readings today are almost identical (7 and 5.5, slightly softer than 2019, respectively) but heading down. By race time, the going is likely to be very similar to the ground on which Straarius’s 10-race winning streak was snapped by Kew Gardens on Champions Day last year.Having been priced up at around 4-7 by most major firms this morning, Straarius is now available at 5-6 with Bet365, in the face of strong support for Martin Meade’s four-year-old Technician, who took the Group One Prix Royal-Oak on heavy ground at Longchamp in October. Oisin Murphy’s mount is now top-priced at 100-30, having been available at 5-1 overnight.Straarius’s win last year was, memorably, Frankie Dettori’s fourth straight winner on the card, and he was only just touched off in the fifth. Having peered into the abyss of a six-timer, bookmakers are likely to be wary of his mounts again today, all but one of which sits in the first three in the betting.Dettori, with one winner so far, needs this to be a moving day if he is to retain the top jockey title he won last year for the first time since 2004. He is now a 3-1 chance for the prize, behind Jim Crowley (2-1), who added another winner yesterday to stand on four, and Ryan Moore (2), the 6-4 favourite. James Doyle, also on two winners, is 10-1. Chris Cook’s selections for the third day are here, and the action is underway at 1.15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a3ce5bd4c7ab4a467e8160ec77d896efa2746e/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387bb454b9488224b8ebf80cd7f41066","title":"zoom encryption free calls","story":"Civil rights groups decried plan to exclude free calls from video calling app’s encryption servicesThe video conferencing platform Zoom announced on Wednesday it has reversed course and decided to provide end-to-end encryption to all customers, not just those who pay for a subscription.The popular app faced criticism from civil rights groups for its plans to exclude free calls from encryption services, which secure communication so they can only be read by the users involved.The company’s CEO, Eric Yuan, had explained that Zoom planned to exclude free calls from end-to-end encryption to make sure it is still possible to “work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose”.But “basic security shouldn’t be a premium feature that’s only available to wealthy iniduals and big corporations,” Evan Greer, the deputy director at the digital rights advocacy group Fight for the Future, said at the time.Zoom changed its decision after speaking with civil liberties organizations, child safety advocates, encryption experts, government representatives, and users, Yuan said in a statement announcing the change. The enhanced encryption will be available starting in July.The video platform exploded in popularity after coronavirus-related lockdowns and is now seeing as many as 300 million daily users, up from just 10 million in December.Meanwhile, it has wrestled with whether encryption would obscure the identity of users and affect its ability to enforce security measures on the app. Zoom has faced continuing instances of “Zoom-bombing”, in which trolls attack users on the app with slurs and offensive imagery. Zoom added security measures in response.To address these concerns while still allowing for encryption and privacy, Zoom will require free users to sign up using a phone number to receive a one-time text message verification.Zoom previously falsely advertised itself as using end-to-end encryption and, once caught, confirmed in a blogpost that end-to-end encryption was not possible on the platform.Meetings will use a different style of encryption by default. For more privacy, hosts will have to manually turn on end-to-end encryption. Hosts on Zoom will be able to turn encryption on and off depending on the meeting.“We encourage everyone to continue to share their views throughout this complex, ongoing process,” Yuan said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72c66cbe198666e8c0d337f11cdd3893658de3/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74525f466e1957a41028cb641038e42c","title":"pacific data cable not safe from china if hong kong included says us","story":"Justice department says ‘recent actions’ by China towards its territory indicate landing station could expose US communications to spyingThe US government wants a high-capacity undersea data cable system proposed by Google and Facebook to bypass Hong Kong, citing potential national security concerns following China’s moves to exert greater control in the territory.The Pacific Light Cable Network, pending approval by the federal communications commission (FCC), should connect the US, Taiwan and the Philippines but not go through Hong Kong as planned, a US Justice Department committee has recommended.The high-capacity, low-latency fibre optic cable backed by Google and Facebook would “encourage” US communications crossing the Pacific Ocean to land in Hong Kong before continuing on to other parts of Asia, the DoJ reasoned.The recommendation to the FCC contended that the cable network’s “proposed Hong Kong landing station would expose US communications traffic to collection” by Beijing.Google and Facebook four years ago announced plans to work with a China Soft Power Holdings subsidiary to connect Los Angeles and Hong Kong with a high-capacity internet cable.The Pacific Light Cable Network was to stretch 12,800km (8,000 miles), crossing beneath the Pacific Ocean in a first-of-its-kind direct connection between the two locations, according to companies involved with the project.The PLCN is expected to handle some 120 terabytes of data per second, enough for 80 million high-definition video conference calls at once between Los Angeles and Hong Kong.Lifestyles and work practices increasingly centred on access to cloud-based online services, as well as to video, pictures and other content on the internet, have increased the need for quick and efficient digital data infrastructure.The FCC in April granted Google’s request for temporary authority to operate the segment of the cable network connecting the US and Taiwan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5950982191f0a59d48bade3fd9042c7b793658/0_0_8661_5197/master/8661.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7965c9fce79a23de690751e7546ce22f","title":"the great review this imperious catherine romp reaches for the tsars elle fanning","story":"Boo to historical accuracy. Hooray to the great comedy cast and script, and watching a ruthless young woman coming up on the inside laneThe Great opens with an asterisk. “The Great,” read the credits, “*an occasionally true story”. It sets the tone admirably. And also acts as a deterrent to all those who thought they might be settling down in front of a new 10-part series by Starzplay devoted to an AJP Taylor-esque exploration of 18th-century Russia and Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst’s rise to power from naive German bridal import to legendary empress Catherine the Great.Instead, this is the story of Empress Catherine (Elle Fanning) for those who found the Helen Mirren thing last year a bit too taxing. And for those who find The Tudors too lacking in jokes and The Borgias just … too bad. In short, most of us.We open in 1761, with aristocratic but impoverished but optimistic but naive young Soph sitting on a swing, regaling her friend with the news that she is soon to be married to Emperor Peter. “Of Russia?” says the friend. In real life, Catherine married the emperor (of Russia) in 1745 and by this point he was a year away from a coup d’etat. But again, if you are someone who already knows this and has been frothing since the beginning of the paragraph, this is not the satirical comedydrama series for you. Go and read a big book, it’s fine.Soon Sophie-known-as-Catherine-because-you-know-what-poshos-are-like is delivered to St Petersburg and Peter. He is played by Nicholas Hoult as Blackadder meets Tom Hulce’s Amadeus, and it’s brilliant. He inspects his blushing bride-to-be fiancee, who hands him a piece of evergreen spruce to symbolise their love. “She’s given me a twig,” he says, concerned, to his advisors. “She’s not another inbred, is she?” Reassured on this point, he resumes courtship. “You’re perfect,” he tells her. “Aristocratic but not powerful or a player. Your family, apparently, are fucked! … You smell funny. Is that usual?” “I’ve been travelling,” ventures his slightly discombobulated fiancee. “Let’s hope it’s that!” he replies, cheerfully, before heading off to hang with his bro-skis.The Archbishop (Adam Godley) tests her religious faith (“How is your relationship with the Lord Our God?” “We’ve had no trouble”) and her hymen and pronounces her fit for purpose. Which, despite Catherine’s love of books, education and all things European and progressive, is to bear heirs (“Let’s hope my seed has found purchase! I must empty myself into you again soon” says Peter, because egomaniacal hedonists are rarely much with the foreplay) and play boules on the lawn with the “cruel and vapid” ladies of the court until Peter’s sack fills again.Gradually Catherine finds a few friends and allies in the house of idiots: Marial (Phoebe Fox, and while I’m here – could we have more Phoebe Fox in our viewing lives, please?), a court lady with a brain but busted down to servant after her father incurred Peter’s wrath, and master strategist General Velementov – the butt of many of the emperor’s brutal practical jokes but whom he keeps around because, as Peter puts it: “He’s good at the thinking part of running the country.” As the mood and marriage darken, they are there to light her way to greatness.It is a romp, with every actor pitch-perfect in their role. Hoult has never been better, Fanning does a fantastic job as the Pollyanna with steel at her core, and Gwilym Lee as cuckolded Grigor Dymov hits his every scene out of the park. The script, adapted by Tony McNamara from his own play, shines – from the rapturous monologue in which Catherine imagines the pleasures of her forthcoming wedding night (“The man caresses you softly … your souls mesh … you fall into a black sky full of stars … end spent and unified!” “Ye-es,” says Marial. “That’s pretty much it”) to the throwaway gags scattered with a liberal hand.The whole is possibly slightly overlong – eight episodes might have done better, especially if they lost some of the more gratuitously violent scenes that occasionally overstep even the broad bounds set by its comic and satirical intentions. But it also offers oblique commentary on the dangers of letting a capricious, narcissistic, bullying man-child rule a nation – to say nothing of the sublime satisfaction of watching someone not just capable coming up on the inside lane but also ruthless enough and sufficiently free of the trappings of modern western democracy to install herself forthwith. I mean, I’m not saying Keir Starmer and Joe Biden should really stage a bilateral coup on both sides of the Atlantic. I’m just saying they could watch this and take a few notes, you know? That would be great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5762506c6003f475cda817411c0759c4a5fd3ef/0_32_2260_1356/master/2260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ec59d1ae3f999a0ab6c5506c146977","title":"kentucky democrats senate charles booker amy mcgrath mitch mcconnell","story":"Charles Booker is less of a long shot to beat Amy McGrath, a centrist former air force pilot, as the Democrats’ pick for a Kentucky Senate seat after weeks of anti-racist protestsAmy McGrath’s nomination was supposed to be a done deal.In the 24 hours after she announced her candidacy last July, the former marine fighter pilot raised $2.5m, a record for a Democratic Senate candidate. She had name recognition from a failed 2018 congressional bid and became more familiar soon when she was hosted on late-night comedy shows, held up as the person who could finally unseat the Senate majority leader – and liberal bete noire – Mitch McConnell.McGrath had said some things that appeared to show an openness towards Donald Trump, but there are those in deep-red Kentucky – where Trump won by 30 points in 2016 – who would say the only way a Democrat can win a statewide race is by being a centrist and wooing Trump voters.She was endorsed by the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and as of the end of March she had roughly 200 times the amount of cash on hand as each of her two progressive, grassroots challengers did. It looked like it was in the bag.Her closest challenger, seen as a distant long shot, was Charles Booker, a progressive 35-year-old African American rookie state representative from Louisville’s predominantly black West End who advocates for things like universal basic income, the green new deal and, now, reimagining law enforcement and cutting back police funding.But in late May, mass protests erupted in Louisville over the police killing of Breonna Taylor here in March. Booker began showing up at the protests, standing out in his suit in crowds that were dressed for the heat and expecting confrontations with riot cops, and even got teargassed alongside protesters.“When this moment happened with Breonna Taylor, I knew where I needed to be at,” he told the  in an interview. “People were grieving, mourning in the streets in real time … And my response to that was to be there with them.”The things Booker had been speaking about – how difficult it is living in the neglected parts of the city and the state – started to resonate with a broader audience. His popularity and name recognition have grown quickly. Suddenly, like a handful of other insurgent candidates around the US, the protests were lifting up politicians who could channel their energy, cause and passion.“When you have an event that’s all anybody can talk about and you have a candidate that seems omnipresent within that event, it can’t not change the dynamics of the race,” said Matt Erwin, a Democratic strategist in the state.Others agree. “I think early on I would say it was not going to be competitive, that McGrath was going to be the nominee,” said Anne Cizmar, a professor of government at Eastern Kentucky University. “But I think now Booker is a competitive candidate to potentially win the nomination.”There is little polling data available, but  last week alone, Booker secured endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Kentucky’s two biggest newspapers. And in an eight-day  earlier this month, he raised nearly triple the amount of money was able to in the first three months of 2020.To Booker, the issues he talks about are personal. He’s black. He’s from the poorest part of Louisville and the state. He’s a type 1 diabetic who says he’s had to ration insulin to put food on the table for his family.His cousin – who was murdered in Louisville four years ago – was a good friend of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old ER tech whose death sparked protests here. On 1 June, a national guard soldier shot and killed David McAtee – known as YaYa or “the barbecue man” – as troops and cops tried to clear a crowd that was violating curfew. McAtee’s barbecue stand is just blocks from Booker’s home and a place he knew well.He told the  that when he was in college, a cop once pulled him over in his neighborhood for making a rolling stop and approached his vehicle with a gun out. These days, as he drives to the state’s capital, he says he regularly passes young men his age lying on the ground, surrounded by police.“Just seeing it, just it being a regular part of how we’re treated, has definitely left a mark on me and helps me see why we need to completely reimagine public safety,” he says of his encounters with law enforcement.He added that institutional and structural racism need to be addressed so that members of poor communities and communities of color “are not treated like a deadly weapon before being treated like a human being”.McGrath is a sharp contrast to Booker.She talks about making healthcare and education cheaper, but not free. She touts the fact that her husband is a Republican and that she is a gun owner. At the race’s sole debate, held the same day Trump delivered a speech in which he called on governors to “dominate the streets” and threatened to use the military to quell protests, McGrath again spoke of how she’d be willing to work with Trump on some issues if he was re-elected.“I think that’s what people want,” she said. “Wouldn’t you want that in a senator?”She said would also stand up to the president when it’s right for Kentucky.How much of a chance Booker has is still debated.“I think he has a shot, but it’s a really long shot, to be quite honest with you,” said Dewey Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Louisville. Booker has momentum, he added “but we’re in June now, I don’t know if it’s going to be enough time before the primary for him to make up what he lacks as far as exposure and getting the message out there.”On Saturday, Booker’s campaign released internal polling data – the only polling data made public for this race to date – that showed McGrath leading him by 10 points. Among those who hadn’t yet voted, however, her lead was down to seven points.Regardless of who wins the primary, beating McConnell in November is seen as a difficult venture.But despite McConnell’s continuing unpopularity and the close poll numbers, experts remain cautious.Clayton, the University of Louisville, professor, said he expects McConnell to win in November, adding that him being one of the most powerful men in the country “gives a lot of Kentuckians a sense of pride, whether they agree with him or not”.Erwin, the Democratic strategist, was more optimistic about voting McConnell out.“I think any Democrat has a fighting chance against the least popular senator in America,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcd825fd86903c7fbe4283e29055c7c29a91310/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc81c2b8e82e1b43a7797df9826a5b0","title":"himalayan flashpoint could spiral out of control as india and china face off","story":"At least 20 died after soldiers fought with clubs and rocks along the disputed border, making de-escalation hard for the nuclear statesThe forces of two nuclear weapons states have set about each other with clubs and rocks at one of the most forbidding flashpoints in the world, in a bloody incident that highlights the constant dangers posed by expansionist nationalism.India has confirmed that it lost at least 20 of its men in a clash with Chinese soldiers near the disputed mountain border running along the Ladakh area of Kashmir. It is the first fatal confrontation since 1975 and the most serious since 1967, and so can be expected to have a powerful galvanising effect on the populations of both countries, already primed by a constant stream of nationalist rhetoric.There is a long history of such encounters ever since the two nations fought a short war there in 1962. After that conflict a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was declared, but there is no agreed line and limited control, as the events of recent weeks have confirmed. Thus far at least, both Indian and Chinese forces have stuck to an agreement not to carry firearms on patrol near the LAC.Beijing has put out a string of statements blaming India but giving no hint of Chinese casualties, estimated in the Indian press to total 43, including some deaths. In the past, such accounting has come decades later, if at all, from a regime that tightly controls information. For that reason, the only detailed accounts to have emerged so far have come from the Indian press.What is clear is that there will be more of these clashes without a clear change of direction and an attempt to agree on where the LAC should be, and how both sides should behave around it. Both Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping have built their images as warriors for national greatness.In his remarks on Wednesday, Modi warned the sacrifice of the soldiers would not be in vain and that India is capable of giving a “befitting reply” if provoked.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking to his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, issued his own warning, that India should not underestimate “China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty”.In the broadest terms the deadly brawl in the Galwan valley was the latest symptom of an increasingly aggressive Chinese policy on territory and borders, of the sort that has been playing out among the rocks and reefs of the South China Sea.Over the decades China has been more assertive than India in building infrastructure around the LAC, with roads and bunkers. In recent years, India has been trying to catch up, in particular with a road to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the highest airstrip in the world, with feeder roads leading off it. China has been trying to push back against that Indian construction work, so that its creeping occupation of the Galwan valley goes unchallenged.Since May, Chinese troops appear to have stopped their Indian counterparts from approaching areas where both sides have patrolled over the years. And Beijing has sent in reinforcements. What distinguishes the current confrontation from previous incidents is not just the death toll but the fact that there have been standoffs in multiple locations.“This kind of territory is incredibly hard to hold, but also to move multiple troops over,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution. “So it’s not considered to be something that just happened on the ground. It’s clearly a decision made by the Chinese at a more senior level.”It is not just about bragging rights over crags. China has built a road, Highway 219, linking Tibet and Xinjiang, that passes through territory near the LAC that India considers its own. India’s foothold at the DBO airfield, on the other hand, allows its forces to look down at the Karakoram highway linking China and Pakistan.The timing of the incident may be connected to the weather. The melting snows of spring provide an opportunity for aggressive moves. The pandemic may also have played a role. It led to India putting off military exercises, and an extra motive for Beijing to look for distractions from its own failures in governance.The deadly clash happened at a time and a place where officers from both sides were trying to negotiate a disengagement of forces. Neither government wants this to escalate, and the foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed on resuming the disengagement process. But the fact that there has been significant loss of life, at least on the Indian side, makes the situation much harder to defuse.“Now domestic politics and public opinion, especially nationalist pressure to avenge their deaths and escalate, becomes a dangerous force,” Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. “It will be hard for India at least, with a relatively open media, to de-escalate as easily now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97df78339637318a1bc4a2799707668f14f3651/0_37_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd8fa2d22f233f174ad390c4946fe34b","title":"argentina president enters voluntary isolation amid coronavirus surge","story":"The sudden spike in cases has also struck a number of current and former senior politiciansArgentina’s president Alberto Fernández has gone into voluntary isolation amid growing concerns over a surge of coronavirus infections, including several cases among the country’s political elite.The decision to quarantine the president – whose popularity is riding high on his no-nonsense response to the pandemic – was taken due to the “significant increase in the circulation of the virus,” presidential doctor Federico Saavedra said in a statement on Wednesday.Until now, Argentina’s strong coronavirus lockdown, had been a standout success in the containment of the pandemic that is ripping through its South American neighbours Brazil and Chile.But that may start changing after Argentina’s reported cases more than quadrupled in the last month following the gradual lockdown relaxation that began on 10 May.The sudden spike in cases has also struck a number of current and former senior politicians, including former Buenos Aires governor María Eugenia Vidal, 46, a presidential hopeful for the 2023 elections for the opposition PRO party.Fears for the president’s safety were sparked by a lunch Vidal had on Friday with fellow PRO politician and Buenos Aires City mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, who meets regularly with Fernández to coordinate pandemic strategies for Buenos Aires City, with a population of 3 million, and its surrounding Greater Buenos Aires urban area, with a population of 11 million, where nearly all of Argentina’s coronavirus cases are concentrated.Other positive cases Vidal had recently been in contact with include Martín Insaurralde, mayor of the district of Lomas de Zamora in the Greater Buenos Aires area, and Buenos Aires provincial legislator Alex Campbell.Argentina’s reported cases have more than quadrupled from only 8,000 on 17 May to some 35,000 cases now, with almost 16,000 of those cases in Buenos Aires City and another 14,000 in the surrounding Greater Buenos Aires area.The number of nationwide deaths has risen from 373 one month ago to 878 Wednesday.Despite the recent surge in cases, Argentina’s numbers remain far below those of its giant northern neighbour Brazil, the country with the second highest caseload in the world, 923,000, and its western neighbour Chile, ranking ninth worldwide with 221,000 cases. Argentina by comparison ranks 34th in number of cases.President Fernández has already started following his doctor’s order to suspend all “travel and personal meetings” and remain within the walls of the Quinta de Olivos presidential compound in Greater Buenos Aires, cancelling his attendance at the forthcoming national flag day ceremony in the central city of Rosario Friday, a major Argentinian festivity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ecf43ee0f1c8fc7a0532702506a81c97dd63bc/0_64_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba665edf1f54d9272aa5c46436b8e147","title":"fauci coronavirus covid 19 cases us","story":"America’s top public health expert has warned the nation it is “still in the first wave” of coronavirus infections and deaths, as six states report record numbers of new cases amid continued rapid easing of lockdown restrictions.Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, expressed worry about new hotspots for infections in major US states, while also advising that “personally, I would not” attend Donald Trump’s first political rally in months, due on Saturday, in Oklahoma, where vast crowds are expected despite rising Covid-19 cases.Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas reported record increases in coronavirus cases on Tuesday, while Nevada recorded its highest ever number of single-day cases.In recent days North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama have reportedly set new highs in seven-day rolling average of Covid-19 cases, as many states have allowed some businesses and public spaces to reopen after months of restrictions.“As New York and other places are coming down, others are going up,” Fauci, who is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Boston Globe about different areas seeing decreases or increases in new cases.“Obviously, we’re concerned about it.”Fauci said he personally would choose not to attend such an event due to the risk of contracting coronavirus. And he warned that talk of whether the US was now experiencing a second wave of Covid-19 cases was premature.“We are seeing infections to a greater degree than they had previously seen in certain states, including states in the south-west and in the south,” Fauci told the Daily Beast. “I don’t like to talk about a second wave right now, because we haven’t gotten out of our first wave.”Oklahoma health officials are urging anyone attending the rally to get tested before arriving, and then to self-isolate afterwards and get tested again. People over 65 have been told to stay at home. The Trump election campaign will recommend the indoor audience wear masks, but is not going to mandate it.The Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, a Republican, said officials would try to make sure the event was as safe as possible. “Ultimately, the president doesn’t ask for permission before he” goes to places, said Stitt on Wednesday.The mayor of Tulsa, GT Bynum, also a Republican, said he would not attend the rally.Vice-President Mike Pence has claimed the US has “slowed the spread”, and both Pence and the president have claimed the worrying increase in coronavirus cases is due to more testing.Fauci said this was not true.“When you look at the number of hospitalizations, and you see some of the states say, ‘Oh my goodness, I’m having more hospitalizations than I had before,’ that cannot be due to increase in testing. That has to be due to increase in real cases,” he told the Globe.Hospitalizations are continuing to rise in the states reporting infection increases.At Tucson medical center in Arizona on Monday, only one intensive care unit bed out of 20 was available. “Better contact your governor (quickly!)”In Florida, 260 workers at the Orlando international airport tested positive for coronavirus, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, said. DeSantis said almost 500 workers had been tested at the airport after two people contracted the virus.In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would monitor the impact of the mass anti-racism protests the city has seen before allowing more businesses to reopen.“We’re all mindful we had a very unique situation with the protests,” De Blasio said on Wednesday, according to NBC News.In Oklahoma Trump supporters have been camping outside the rally venue for days, despite the risks.Tulsa residents and business owners were thwarted in their attempt to block the rally, which will take place at the indoor, 19,000-capacity BOK Center, on Tuesday. Residents had filed a lawsuit in an effort to have the rally cancelled, “to protect against a substantial, imminent, and deadly risk to the community”, but a judge refused the request.On Monday Trump – who has previously lied about the number of people at his rallies and events – said “almost 1 million people” had requested tickets for the event.Fauci has warned people against attending the rally, which had originally been planned for Friday, a date which marks the end of slavery in the US, before the Trump campaign switched the date amid widespread criticism.Asked if he would personally attend the campaign rally, Fauci said: “No.”“I’m in a high-risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,” he said. With regard to Trump’s rallies, Fauci said “outside is better than inside, no crowd is better than crowd” and “crowd is better than big crowd”.Tulsa’s chief public health officer, Bruce Dart, and the Tulsa World newspaper have urged Trump to cancel the rally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea83d0e5344cd58810caef54434dca3d6f7de043/0_134_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e66f662007d7d4fe94820b2b4eeb76","title":"uk ministers order urgent vitamin d coronavirus review","story":"Exclusive: emerging evidence studied to see if ‘sunshine nutrient’ could lower Covid-19 riskPublic health officials are urgently reviewing the potential ability of vitamin D to reduce the risk of coronavirus.A delayed Public Health England review into the reasons why BAME people are disproportionately affected, which pointed to historical racism, did not review the role of diet and vitamin D.The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) began this work last month and is considering recent evidence on vitamin D and acute respiratory tract infection in the general population. Evidence will be considered on specific population groups, including those of different ages and BAME groups. In a parallel development, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D “in the context of Covid-19” with support from Public Health England (PHE).It is understood the reviews will be published in the coming weeks. The Nice review may be used alongside other available information, such as specific patient circumstances, to inform inidual healthcare decisions. Public Health Scotland and NHS boards are also assessing emerging evidence to see whether the so-called sunshine nutrient should be prescribed in hospitals and to high-risk groups to mitigate a second wave of Covid-19.Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, welcomed the reviews and said deaths among BAME NHS staff had brought the question of vitamin D deficiency to the fore.“Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,” he said. “It boosts the ability of cells to kill and resist viruses and simultaneously dampens down harmful inflammation, which is one of the big problems with Covid.”He is leading a national study collecting information about risk factors for Covid-19 with a focus on vitamin D deficiency to address the absence of research in this area. Any UK resident aged above 16 is eligible to participate.“There are no clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent Covid ongoing anywhere in the world to my knowledge and clinical evidence for its use to reduce risk of acute respiratory infections is mixed,” Martineau added.However, studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection. Higher levels of melanin in the skin lead to lower levels of vitamin D creation which are exacerbated in countries which have less sunlight. This can cause immune systems to be weaker.PHE has acknowledged reports about vitamin D potentially reducing the risk of coronavirus but said there was not enough evidence to support this.It has since April recommended all people take 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health owing to concerns they may not be getting enough sunlight, particularly during the lockdown.UK vitamin D advice is focused on musculoskeletal health conditions such as rickets and there are fears that its effect on general immune systems has been overlooked. On 3 June the Scottish government specifically recommended people from minority ethnic groups with dark skin to take the supplement.Across the UK, as many as 750 NHS staff have received free wellness packs including liposomal vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc from a voluntary initiative called the Frontline Immune Support Team, and there has been some frustration that a more holistic approach to the pandemic has not been implemented.Singapore general hospital reportedly routinely gives coronavirus patients aged over 50 a mix of vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin B12, while countries which have recently had summers have generally been less affected by the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee81c0e3928a318bc62dbc3572bf52b6927bbce1/0_333_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=525aea68cba804f7beaa646ab6ae8afb","title":"china tables draft hong kong security law in sign it intends to rush legislation","story":"Beijing has tabled a draft of the Hong Kong national security laws before its top lawmaking body, indicating it intends to rush through the contentious legislation which promises to drastically increase Chinese control over the semi-autonomous region.State media reported on Thursday the draft law was put before the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), charged with drafting the law, for a three-day session beginning Thursday. Typically bills should go through three readings by the NPC committee, which meets every two months, but officials said last month the laws would be implemented “without delay”.The report by state media organisation Xinhua gave little detail on the draft, but said it clarified the four major offences – including secession, subversion of state power, and terrorist activities – and the associated penalties.Beijing appears to have strengthened the wording of the fourth offence relating to foreign involvement, and what was previously criminalising “foreign and external interference in Hong Kong affairs” now criminalises “collusion with foreign and external forces” to endanger national security.In late May, Beijing’s parliament rubber stamped the proposal to introduce national security laws, which could see mainland security agencies and secret police established in Hong Kong. The decision drew condemnation from pro-democracy and legal figures inside Hong Kong and globally, and has caused alarm among business and media.This week all G7 nations have issued a joint statement expressing deep concern about the laws, and urging Beijing to reconsider. In response they were met with sharp rebuke and indignation by the Chinese foreign ministry, and were told to stop interfering in Chinese affairs.“China’s determination to push for a national security law in Hong Kong is unshakeable,” China’s foreign ministry said its senior diplomat Yang Jiechi told US secretary of state at a bilateral meeting on Thursday.“China resolutely opposes the US interference in Hong Kong affairs and the G7 foreign ministers releasing a statement on Hong Kong.”Under the 1997 joint declaration signed by Britain and China at the handover of Hong Kong, the city was guaranteed 50 years of a high degree of autonomy, under the “one country two systems” principle and governed by its own mini-constitution, the Basic Law.The Hong Kong government says it has failed on a Basic Law obligation to enact its own national security laws and is unlikely to do so in the near future, and so it supports Beijing’s decision to promulgate the laws itself. Hong Kong’s election is scheduled for September.However, opponents have noted that other obligations, such as the promise of universal suffrage by 2007, have also failed to be delivered, and that Beijing is increasingly overreaching in its attempts to control the city and snuff out a growing pro-democracy movement driven by a year of mass protests.Claudia Mo, a high-profile pro-democracy politician, said the laws seemed a “fait accompli”.“Every time in Hong Kong you think things can’t get worse, things will get worse. So we’re almost numbed to it,” Mo told the .Mo was also worried by comments from chief executive Carrie Lam earlier this week that the laws could be retroactively applied, and she was skeptical of assurances that extradition would only be used in exceptional circumstances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0facb0c732d39ca401534fee9322c09ff7898dbd/0_217_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e599cde286f3b0035d6422191c7ce15","title":"india cautions china against exaggerated and untenable claims in border standoff","story":"Both sides have accused each other of instigating the clash on Himalayan frontier in which at least 20 troops diedIndia on Thursday cautioned China against making “exaggerated and untenable claims” to the Galvan valley area even as both nations tried to end a standoff in the high Himalayan region after their armies engaged in a deadly clash.Twenty Indian troops were killed in the clash on Monday night that was the deadliest conflict between the sides in 45 years. China has not disclosed whether its forces suffered any casualties.Responding to China’s claim to the valley, India’s external affairs ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava, said both sides had agreed to handle the situation responsibly. “Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,” he said in a statement.Both sides have accused each other of instigating the clash between their forces in the valley, part of the disputed Ladakh region along the Himalayan frontier.Media reports said senior army officers of the two sides met on Wednesday to defuse the situation, but there was no confirmation from either side.Indian security forces said neither side fired any shots, instead throwing rocks and trading blows. The Indian soldiers, including a colonel, died of severe injuries and exposure in the area’s sub-zero temperatures, the officials said.The clash escalated a standoff in the disputed region that began in early May, when Indian officials said Chinese soldiers crossed the boundary at three different points, erecting tents and guard posts and ignoring warnings to leave. That triggered shouting matches, stone-throwing and fistfights, much of it replayed on television news channels and social media.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warned New Delhi not to underestimate Beijing’s determination to safeguard what it considers its sovereign territory. His comments came in a phone call on Wednesday with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.Wang said China demanded that India conduct a thorough investigation and “harshly punish” those responsible.“The Indian side would best not make an incorrect judgment of the situation, would best not underestimate China’s strong determination to safety its sovereign territory,” Wang said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry.He repeated China’s claims that India was solely responsible for the conflict, saying Indian forces had crossed the Line of Actual Control that ides the thousands of troops from both sides deployed in the area.Jaishankar, in turn, accused China of erecting a structure in the Galvan valley, which he called a “premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties,” according to a statement.He added that the incident would have “serious repercussions” on India’s relationship with China, but that both sides were committed to further disengaging on the remote plateau of the Himalayan terrain.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi hailed the soldiers killed in the clashes. “Their sacrifices won’t go to waste,” he said. “For us, the unity and sovereignty of the country is the most important thing. India wants peace, but when provoked, it is capable of giving a fitting reply, be it any kind of situation.”While experts said the two nations were unlikely to head to war, they also believe easing tensions quickly will be difficult.Josep Borrell, a European Union vice president, urged both sides to show restraint and engage in military deescalation.“We express our deep regrets for the casualties incurred and offer our condolences to their loved ones,” the statement said. It called India and China both important partners of the EU and “crucial actors for regional and global stability.”China claims about 90,000 sq km (35,000 square miles) of territory in India’s northeast, while India says China occupies 38,000 sq km (15,000 square miles) of its territory in the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, a contiguous part of the Ladakh region.India unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory while separating it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019. China was among the handful of countries to strongly condemn the move, raising it at international forums including the U.N. Security Council.Thousands of soldiers on both sides have faced off over a month along a remote stretch of the 3,380km (2,100-mile) Line of Actual Control, the border established following a war between India and China in 1962 that resulted in an uneasy truce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddffd522e954f1d834e2f0f680f02bd679bcee56/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=acd1cc0533221657716da4b8867f6f16","title":"new zealand coronavirus defences under scrutiny as more breaches emerge","story":"Third case flew from Pakistan via Doha and Melbourne, says director general of health as further reports surface of ill-advised birthday parties and funeral gatheringsA fresh coronavirus case has been reported in New Zealand as officials scramble to contain the fallout from Tuesday’s embarrassing quarantine breach and reports emerge of people disappearing after leaving isolation early.Thursday’s case – the third to emerge this week after a 24-day streak of no cases – was a man in his 60s who arrived in Auckland from Pakistan on 13 June on Flight NZ124, transiting through Doha and Melbourne.Officials were contacting all passengers on the flight and have alerted overseas counterparts for the other flights, said Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health. The man was wearing a mask on all flights and was now in a quarantine facility in Auckland, Bloomfield said.It came as police said six people absconded from managed isolation after being granted compassionate leave from Covid-19 quarantine to attend a funeral in Hamilton. And TVNZ reported that a birthday party for a girl in isolation brought people together who should not have been mingling.Bloomfield was forced to apologise on Thursday after initially claiming the sisters behind Tuesday’s new cases had not contacted anyone during their road trip from Wellington to Auckland. It was revealed late on Wednesday that they came into contact with at least two friends who helped them after they got lost on a motorway.The director general said neither of the New Zealand women recalled they had brief physical contact with anyone and so the public health unit did not feel the need to report that. “When I found that out, I followed up,” Bloomfield said. “Yes, the situation has changed, and I’ve been open about that.”“The case of these two women will have upset people, I am certainly upset by it,” he said. “I apologise that we’ve ended up in this position.”Bloomfield wanted to assure New Zealanders that they could trust what he said. The friends of the women have been tested, he added, and one has returned a negative result and the other is waiting for her result.On Tuesday, New Zealand recorded its first new cases of the virus for 24 days after the two New Zealanders, sisters returning after travelling to the UK, were found to be infected. The pair, who were permitted to leave their managed isolation early to visit a dying parent, had not been tested.Since then more reports have emerged. A Christchurch funeral director told Stuff that about 10 people had been let out of quarantine early to attend one of the funerals it had arranged on Tuesday. Steve Parkyn, chief executive of funeral directors Lamb and Hayward, said he refused to let them attend the service after being contacted by health authorities, but they joined mourners at the burial, accompanied by a health official. Around 200 people attended the funeral.Government policy is for everyone in 14-day managed isolation to be tested twice for Covid-19 and to return a negative result before leaving. However, exemptions on compassionate grounds were allowed.Officials are tracing 313 “close contacts”– instead of the previously stated 320 – of the first two cases, which includes hotel workers, guests, health staff and aircrew.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the military would audit and oversee quarantine arrangements.The opposition health spokesperson, Michael Woodhouse, said health minister David Clark should step down for being “completely disengaged from his role”.“If I was the minister this wouldn’t have happened,” Woodhouse said.Winston Peters, the minister of foreign affairs said that a potential trans-Tasman travel bubble had not been jeopardised despite the breaches, because it still dealt with two “Covid-safe states”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/686c9fc7dc38a5e04ad8045654b9598e2c81b6f0/0_287_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d725348ac6dcb12c15f046f7b9bd4620","title":"papua new guinea chiefs call for halt to plan for countrys largest ever mine","story":"Locals say the Sepik river region must be protected from ‘exploitation and destruction from outsiders’Chiefs from 28 haus tambarans – “spirit houses” – representing 78,000 people along Papua New Guinea’s remote Sepik river have formally declared they want a proposal for the country’s largest ever mine halted.PanAust, an Australian-registered miner ultimately owned by the Chinese state-owned Guangdong Rising Assets Management, has proposed building a gold, silver and copper mine on the Frieda river, a tributary to the Sepik.The mine would be the largest in PNG’s history, and one of the largest in the world, covering 16,000 hectares, and is forecast to yield gold, silver and copper worth an estimated US$1.5bn a year for more than 30 years.Haus tambarans are the cultural and political hub of villages in the Sepik region. Pre-colonisation their function was analogous to a local parliament, where debates were held and collective decisions taken. But they also play important roles in spiritual and ancestral connection and in rituals and initiations. In an unprecedented move, the 28 haus tambarans issued a collective Supreme Sukundimi Declaration calling for “a total ban on the Frieda river mine”.It said: “The river is the life of the Sepik and therefore it must be protected at all cost.

Our future is in peril from this proposed mine and, therefore, we have gathered together as s of the river to stand firm as one.”In its environmental impact statement for the Frieda river mine, PanAust said the “nation-building project … presents broad commercial and socioeconomic development opportunities for Papua New Guinea”.PanAust said it had engaged in “extensive and ongoing engagement … over several decades” with those affected by the mine, running information sessions in nearly 140 villages, attended by more than 18,000 people.“Local opinions and issues have been sought through engagement campaigns … formal and informal meetings with village leaders, and through socioeconomic surveys conducted in villages between 2010 and 2018,” the company said in the statement.The mine plan also includes a hydroelectric plant, power grid, and road, airport and seaport upgrades.In March, campaign group Project Sepik and the Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights (CELCOR) submitted several expert reports to the PNG government’s Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA), arguing the mine’s environmental impact statement was deficient because it lacked critical information about a tailings dam, analysis on the probability and consequence of a dam break, and settlement plans for displaced villages.Mine campaigner Emmanuel Peni told the  PanAust had not been “honest or transparent” in its consultations with those who live in the Sepik river valley.He said people whose lives and livelihoods depended on the river feared their villages could be permanently damaged or destroyed by the mine, citing the case of Rio Tinto’s Panguna mine, which has left downstream villages with poisoned water, polluted fields and a ruined river valley.“If the dam collapses it will be catastrophic and destroy the Sepik river and our way of life,” he said. “We need to ensure that the Sepik is protected. It is our identity, our life, and the heartbeat of our culture. A life without the Sepik river as we know it would devastate our communities forever.”Peni, from Korogu village on the Sepik River, said the villages felt the need to make the collective declaration – admissible in court – because “they do not trust the government, the police, the army and the outsider who is the owner of the Frieda mine”.Peni said villages along the Frieda and Sepik rivers would seek to halt the mine through legal and legislative channels but would ultimately defend their ancestral lands.“There will be an uprising in the Sepik region and lives will be lost. No one will win this uprising. The government of PNG will have blood on their hands.” put detailed questions to PanAust regarding its community consultation process and environmental impact statement.The company said: “PanAust remains committed to working with its communities, the government of Papua New Guinea and other relevant stakeholders to fulfil its statutory requirements and obtain the necessary permits to progress the Frieda river Project.”PanAust said it declined to comment further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f28c1c8ee1eea07161d9167940e3f06d62e785cb/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50bc306e5c11b56135c60c64fe065a6 660w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 1m as who hails steroid treatment hope","story":"Record rise of infections in Indonesia New Zealand reports another new case Brazil nears 1m infections US still in first wave of virus outbreak, says FauciThe Spanish government has unveiled a €4.3bn (£3.9bn) plan to help the country’s lucrative and important tourist sector as it emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic and prepares to welcome visitors from EU and Schengen areas countries this Sunday.On Thursday, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced a 28-point plan intended to restore confidence in Spain as a safe destination, improve its competitiveness and boost its image abroad.“Spain is opening up for tourism again,” said Sánchez. “We are world leaders and that’s why every step we take will be a safe step. Through prudence and responsibility we will show that Spain is a safe and healthy destination.”Under the plan, €200m has been spent on 21 health and hygiene guides to help those in the sector prevent the spread of the coronavirus. New credit lines worth €2.5bn will also be made available to help the struggling sector.Thursday’s announcements bring the total the government has pledged to the sector to €19.5bn. In Germany’s western state of North Rhein Westphalia, around 7,000 people have been placed in quarantine and schools and kindergartens have been closes after an outbreak of Coronavirus.The spread is believed to have come from Tönnies, a meat processing plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, where there have been 657 confirmed cases of the virus.Elsewhere, Martin Hikel, mayor in the southern Berlin district of Neukölln, has said authorities are trying to trace the origins of a worrying new spread of the virus there, which has so far infected around 70 local residents. Police are reportedly guarding seven neighbouring residential blocks , in which over 370 separate households, many of them living in very cramped conditions, are currently under quarantine.Hikel said the incidences were extremely concerning, not least because “we still don’t know the full extent of it,” he told Der Spiegel in an interview. Hikel said social workers were helping out the families, informing them of the importance of the quarantine and assisting them where possible. A group of locals has formed a network of volunteers, providing the affected residents with packages of food and toys, and going shopping for them.Hikel said many of those in quarantine are Roma families “who already struggle on a daily basis to make ends meet” and for whom the current situation is a “catastrophe”.It is believed the spread might have happened during a religious gathering, possibly at a picnic organised by the church. “It is proof that the pandemic is still very much alive,” Hikel said.The latest events are among similar incidents over the past few weeks, which has thrown renewed light on the precarious working conditions of many of the workers, mainly from southern and eastern Europe, who typically work cheek by jowl, live in close quarters, and regularly travel in large groups to visit their families in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria in particular. As well as concern over the workers’ welfare, the outbreaks have triggered a renewed debate over the meat industry, amid widespread calls for an improvement in standards, including better wages and the introduction of a minimum price policy for meat, particularly in supermarkets.A video put on YouTube a month ago, from the campaign group Arbeitsunrecht (unfair work) which allegedly shows Tönnies workers sitting in their works canteen shoulder to shoulder even as company bosses insisted they were abiding by physical distancing rules, has gone viral as a result of the latest coverage.Here’s a roundup of the latest key developments:Beijing records 21 new cases. Beijing confirmed 21 new Covid-19 cases, amid fears that a new cluster in the city may have begun a month earlier than first thought. There are now more 150 new cases in the Chinese capital. China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the new outbreak probably did not occur in early June or late May, but a month earlier, according to state media.Increase in surveillance Extensive surveillance measures introduced around the world during the coronavirus outbreak have widened and become entrenched, digital rights experts have said, three months after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Top10VPN, a pro-digital privacy website, said digital tracking was in use in 35 countries, with contact tracing apps in at least 28 countries, half of which use GPS location data. Meanwhile, more than half of the apps do not disclose how long users’ data is stored.The global death toll from coronavirus nears 450,000The Johns Hopkins University tracker is recording more than 449,273 deaths from Covid-19 across the world on Thursday. More than one in four fatalities are in the US, making it by far the worst-hit country. There are 8,349,950 cases worldwide. ‘National leader’ of Kazakhstan tests positiveNursultan Nazarbayev, the former president of Kazakhstan who remains its national leader, has tested positive for coronavirus. A spokesman for the 79 year old statesman said there was ‘no reason for concern’. Denmark to relax border restrictionsDenmark will allow citizens from European countries with low infections to enter the country from 27 June. EU and Schengen countries, including the UK, would be inidually assessed based on objective criteria, the foreign ministry said. Sweden and Portugal did not meet the criteria, it said.Brazil recorded 1,269 additional Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, bringing its official death toll from the novel coronavirus to 46,510, the most in the world outside the United States. The Health Ministry also registered 32,188 new cases of the virus since its Tuesday update, for a total of 955,377 confirmed cases, also second to the United States globally.Honduras president admitted to hospital with pneumoniaPresident Juan Orlando Hernández announced late Tuesday that he and his wife had tested positive for the virus. Just hours later he was taken to hospital after doctors determined he had pneumonia. From March to 7 June, Honduras confirmed 6,327 coronavirus infections. In the 10 days since, it added 3,329 more, a surge that has come after the government began a gradual reactivation of the economy.New Zealand confirms one new caseOne more case has been confirmed in the New Zealand after two women who had travelled to the UK tested positive earlier this week. More reports have emerged in New Zealand of people leaving isolation without being tested and going on to meet friends, placing government officials under increasing scrutiny over the rigour of their Covid-19 quarantine rules. Police revealed that six people absconded from managed isolation after being granted compassionate leave from Covid-19 quarantine to attend a funeral in Hamilton.In England, the number of contacts of positive Covid-19 cases identified by the test and trace system rose to 44,895 in its second week, Britain’s health ministry said on Thursday.The government’s test and trace system is seen as key to helping to monitor the spread of the new coronavirus and ease lockdown measures. The Department of Health said that 5,949 people who tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) had their case transferred to the contact tracing system in its second week of operation. It said that 44,895 contacts were identified, up from nearly 32,000 last week. Of those identified in the second week, 40,690 people, were reached and advised to self-isolate.The Kremlin on Thursday described accusations by Britain that Russia, along with China and Iran, was looking to exploit opportunities created by the coronavirus, as “absurd”. “We categorically disagree with such statements,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “As far as disinformation is concerned, we consider such accusations absurd.” Peskov said Russia and China were cooperating with the international fight against the coronavirus in response to the assertions made by UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Nearly 500 Russian medics who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, the head of the state health watchdog said Thursday, a far higher figure than given before.“489 - that is medics, unfortunately we have lost almost 500 of our colleagues,” the Roszdravnadzor watchdog chief Alla Samoilova said at an online conference, TASS state news agency reported.Previously a health ministry official on May 26 gave a confirmed death toll of 101.The new number is even higher than that given by an independent website set up by medics where colleagues report deaths, the Remembrance List, which lists 444 deaths.Hello everyone.

Sweden and Portugal did not meet the criteria, it said.A country would be classified as open if it has less than 20 infected people per 100,000 inhabitants a week.Denmark’s strict border policy sparked protests last week from employees in the aviation industry. The World Health Organization is looking at interim data from its large multi-country trial of the combination of HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir to treat Covid-19 patients, the UN agency’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan has said.Her comments come after the WHO stopped testing of the malaria drug in the trial of treatments for Covid-19 patients, after studies indicated it showed no benefit in those who have the disease. She said more study was needed to see whether hydroxchloroquine could prevent infection.The malaria drug had been championed by Donald Trump for treating Covid-19. But earlier this week, the US Food and Drug Administration, revoked the emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine amid growing evidence that is doesn’t work and could cause serious side effects.The authorities in Turkey have made the wearing of face masks mandatory in three major cities following an uptick in confirmed cases since the reopening of many businesses, AP reports.The governors of Istanbul, Ankara and Bursa announced the mask rule late on Wednesday in line with a recommendation by the country’s scientific advisory council.Masks are now obligatory in 47 out of 81 provinces. The statements said masks would be worn in all public spaces.Turkey has seen an upward trend in the daily number of infections after the government authorised cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen, lifted inter-city travel restrictions and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June.The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, announced that confirmed daily infections were about 653 in the past month in Istanbul, Turkeys most populous city with more than 15 million residents, and noted that the daily average fell to 616 in the past three days.In the capital, Ankara, the range in one month has been between 127 and 177 new infections a day with an uptick in the past week.Turkey has reported 182,727 confirmed cases and 4,861 deaths from Covid-19 since March.Indonesia has reported 1,331 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, its biggest daily increase since the outbreak started locally, taking its total number of cases to 42,762.Achmad Yurianto, a health ministry official, said 63 more deaths were reported on Thursday, with total fatalities now at 2,339, the highest coronavirus death toll in east Asia outside of China.Indonesia on Wednesday overtook Singapore with the largest number of Covid-19 cases in south-east Asia.Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has urged the European Union to agree a €750bn stimulus package by the end of July to help the European economy recover from the impact of the pandemic, AFP reports.“It would be best if we could reach an agreement before the summer break,” Merkel said, calling for compromise from member states to enable the deal to be ratified by the end of the year.“We must act quickly and decisively,” she said.The European commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed the huge fund to help the EU out of its deepest-ever recession, but the plan was immediately met with fierce opposition from fiscally conservative member states including Austria and the Netherlands.The proposed package consists of €500bn in grants and €250bn in loans, but requires unanimous EU approval.“The starting position is far from easy but I hope that all member states will act in a spirit of compromise in the face of this unprecedented situation,” Merkel said.“Cohesion and solidarity have never been more important than today. The crisis can only be overcome if we act for and with each other,” she said.The European Council is due to hold a video summit on 19 June on the controversial stimulus package, the EU’s largest to date.However, a decision is not expected until the leaders have met in person, said Merkel, whose country assumes the EU presidency in July.The German chancellor had in late May stunned observers by proposing along with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the plan for €500bn in grants to help the hardest hit EU members to get their economies back on track.That proposal, now making up the bulk of von der Leyen’s package, shattered a long-standing German taboo as it included taking on shared debt, a dramatic U-turn after years of obstinate German opposition to joint borrowing.Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former president of Kazakhstan who remains its national leader, has tested positive for coronavirus. At 79, Nazarbayev retains sweeping powers as national leader, chair of the security council and head of the ruling party.“There is no reason for concern,” his spokesman, Aidos Ukibay, said on Twitter. Several members of Kazakhstan’s government self-isolated earlier this week after the health minister, Yelzhan Birtanov, and lower house speaker, Nurlan Nigmatulin, tested positive for Covid-19.Kazakhstan announced a tightening of restrictions for the coming weekend amid fears that outbreak is worsening, according to Reuters. Shopping malls, markets and parks will be closed in big cities on 20-21 June and additional hospital beds will be made available for Covid-19 patients, the government said. It also ordered all provinces to broaden testing for the disease.The spread of the virus has accelerated in the nation of 19 million since it ended a nationwide lockdown last month. Kazakhstan had reported about 23,000 cases as of Friday, with 100 deaths, up from about 5,000 at the end of its lockdown.Afghanistan has announced 42 new Covid-19 deaths, its highest daily toll in an outbreak that has now killed 546 Afghans. The country’s health ministry also announced 658 new cases bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 27,532.The country, which has admitted it has a lack of testing capacity, has tested 61,599 suspected patients since the outbreak began. There have been 7,660 recoveries.Most of the new cases (415) have been reported in the capital, Kabul. It is the country’s worst-affected area so far, with 11,339 cases and 126 deaths.Most of the new deaths reported in the western province of Herat where its laboratory – which is responsible for testing samples of patients in Herat and nearby areas – has halted work due to a lack of kits for Neara week.The health ministry recorded 19 deaths of Covid-19 in the province on Thursday. Herat which borders Iran has so far recorded 4,304 confirmed cases and 108 deaths.Wahid Qatali, the governor of Herat recently said that the actual number of infections may be more than 60,000 in the province. The first case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from the neighbouring country in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined.The Afghan health ministry has previously said it was unable to increase testing for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients.The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said the case of two women who had reintroduced Covid-19 to New Zealand after travelling to the UK, showed how important it was for people to follow guidelines.The two women infected with Covid-19 were allowed to leave quarantine without being tested and then met up with friends in New Zealand.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Raab said: It shows how careful we need to be, but the travel advice for a while now has been to advise against all but essential global travel. We need to see it applied consistently. Overall, the public have been terrific in following the guidelines. And it gets trickier as you come out of lockdown because the changes are incremental. But we do need to keep following the guidance as we take those careful steps out of the previous regime. The New Zealand officials said the women had “done everything right” after they were released from quarantine, but the New Zealand government is facing questions about why they were not tested before being allowed to leave an Auckland hotel after they arrived from the UK on 7 June. The women had received a compassionate exemption to the compulsory 14-day isolation period for returning travellers in order to visit a dying relative 400 miles (650km) away in Wellington. The compassionate dispensation policy has been suspended.Extensive surveillance measures introduced around the world during the coronavirus outbreak have widened and become entrenched, digital rights experts have said, three months after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic.The measures have often been billed as temporary necessities rushed into place to help track infections, but governments have been accused of denting civil rights with the widespread use of techniques such as phone monitoring, contact tracing apps, and physical surveillance such as CCTV with facial recognition.Top10VPN, a pro-digital privacy website that reviews secure internet connection software, has maintained a database since March of digital and physical surveillance measures implemented to fight the virus.As of Wednesday, it showed digital tracking was in use in 35 countries, with contact tracing apps in at least 28 countries, half of which use GPS location data. Meanwhile, more than half of the apps do not disclose how long users’ data is stored.Three more coronavirus deaths have been announced in El Salvador.Central America’s smallest and most densely populated country has recorded more than 80 deaths from the virus and more than 4,000 cases.In neighbouring Honduras, the president Juan Orlando Hernández, has been admitted to hospital two days after testing positive for the virus.This is Matthew Weaver picking up the global coronavirus live blog from Helen.

Photograph: iStockPubs intending to open from the end of the month can provide a time slot of an hour and three quarters for customers under final guidelines for the industry.Businesses will also be allowed to implement a one-metre physical distancing guideline in “permitted controlled environments.”Following pressure from industry representatives, the seating time in pubs has changed from 90 minutes to 105 minutes with an additional 15 minutes between bookings, which is two hours in total.“The 15 minutes has been added to allow for adequate cleaning and to ensure customers leave and enter without mixing,” the guidelines state.Businesses will now also be required to collect the contact information of just the “party lead”. Previously, the original HPSC guidance stated that this should be collected for the full group.The guidance says that where at all practical workers in pubs should provide services to only one gathering and should not move between different function rooms.It says toilets should not be used simultaneously by multiple gatherings. Pubs will also be asked to make regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and wash their hands regularly and will be asked to place plexiglass barriers at tills and counters.Customers will also have to be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.Pubs will be required to serve a “substantial meal” for which it would be reasonable to charge not less than €9. Physical distancing of at least one metre should be maintained between people seated at tables.Pre booking will be encouraged as much as possible and a text may be sent to remind the customer to stay away if unwell.A distance of two metres and a minimum of one metre should be maintained between employees. Where two metres is not possible “all other measures to protect employees should be in place,” the guidance says.Previously Dr Tony Holohan, the State’s chief medical officer, had said pubs operating as restaurants would not mean several people meeting up “for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts”.Pubs reopening as restaurants would not need a restaurant licence to do so, the Government has said.Fáilte Ireland chief executive Paul Kelly said the guidelines are “intended to provide clarity to businesses so that they can reopen safely on June 29th.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man arrested after armed on-duty male detective is shot with his own gun in CastlereaIreland is elected for two years to the UN\u0026rsquos most powerful body for first time since 2001Colm Horkan was from Charlestown in Co Mayo and was in his 40sCastlerea parish priest tells of poignant scene when he performed last rites on detectiveThe physicist, who died in February, worked with Nasa to protect astronauts from radiationWidely-available drug shown in UK to significantly reduce death rateRural Independents TD plans to raise issue of infrastructure outside major citiesMore than 2,400 members have registered to vote on the programme for governmentEmails show nursing homes and families pleading for help from Leo VaradkarMembers believe it will take a lot of persuasion to get two-thirds to endorse documentFacilities in Galway and Mayo say they have had no deaths associated with the virusCuthbert Lucas played played tennis and croquet and drank whiskey with his captorsDr Ebun Joseph is encouraging young white Irish people to join an online discussion on racismCall for formal guidelines after Northern Irish data shows early intervention \u0026lsquocritical\u0026rsquoHSE chief to tell D\u0026aacuteil committee that half of nursing home infection clusters now \u0026lsquoclosed\u0026rsquoUnder Operation Coronation, 200 garda\u0026iacute and Army members swooped on three countiesJoint operation against Collopy gang yields evidence of criminal proceeds in UAESurvey shows children spending more time playing outdoors than before pandemicOnly contact details of one group member will be required under HPSC planThe children were due to be resettled in March, but it was postponed due to Covid-19Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282355.1592475289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer is winning a seat on un security council a big deal for ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and  Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney,   react as it was confirmed that Ireland had secured a seat on the  United Nations Security Council. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyIs winning a seat on the United Nations Security Council a big deal?The 15-member UN Security Council is the most powerful body in the UN system. In terms of global diplomacy, there is no higher platform where a country can influence international affairs.It is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security. The council determines when and where a UN peace operation is deployed.It has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to adopt, though permanent members of the council, notably Russia, have used their veto powers to block resolutions made by the council, which has weakened it.So Ireland is getting to play international diplomacy with the big countries?Yes. There are five permanent members of the council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ten non-permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms.Ireland and Norway won the two seats in their regional group on Wednesday, edging out Canada in a three-horse race.Ireland will hold the monthly presidency of the council at least once during its term in office as it is rotated alphabetically among the membership, so this will be a high profile role for Ireland’s ambassador at the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and whoever the new Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the next government.What swung it for the Irish bid?It is hard to say because the vote is a secret ballot. The Irish campaign, hung on a theme of “Empathy, Partnership and Independent”, played up Ireland’s status as a small nation being able to sit at the table with the big nations and represent the small countries at the 193-nation forum. Ireland’s history of famine, emigration and conflict resolution along with the Irish commitment to multilateralism and long contribution to UN peacekeeping (since 1958) will no doubt have helped. Hard to say. The U2 singer’s appeal as a humanitarian certainly did not hurt Ireland’s bid if the crowd of UN ambassadors that swarmed around him and former Irish president Mary Robinson when they helped launch Ireland’s bid in New York in the summer of 2018 is to be judged.Has Ireland held a temporary seat on the council before?Yes, on three previous occasions - in 1962, 1981 and 2001. Did it make a difference then?Yes. Ireland’s then ambassador to the UN Richard Ryan held the month-long presidency of the UN Security Council in October 2001 when the US started bombing targets in Afghanistan in response to the September 11th terror attacks. Mr Ryan had to work diplomatic channels to bring the US into the Security Council and encourage the neo-conservative foreign policy hawks in the George W Bush administration to use the inner sanctum of the UN which it had avoided because of potential entanglement with permanent members China and Russia over its military actions. How much has membership of the council cost and will it cost?The Government spent €840,000 on the campaign to win a seat over a three-year period - about half what the Norwegians and Canadians spent on their campaigns. A further €2 million has been budgeted by the Government for the two years Ireland is on the council from the start of 2021.Is it worth it?Critics have dismissed the value of membership with former  diplomatic correspondent Wesley Boyd describing it as an “expensive vanity trip.” This has been rejected by Government officials, diplomats and others who see the role on the council as bringing respect and influence to a small country on one of the highest international stages. As one of only three European Union members on the council, it will also help Ireland’s standing at a European level.Could our membership cause tensions with other countries?Quite possibly. Ireland will be joining the council at a critical time as multilateral institutions like the UN are under threat from the rise of nationalism and the increasing power of dictators and authoritarian countries.

The deputy leader’s speech, in particular, will be closely monitored to see if there are any major conditionalities or reservations in her endorsement of the coalition deal.In what was portrayed as a significant boost by Green members campaigning for the coalition, the prominent climate change expert Prof John Sweeney yesterday endorsed the deal saying it had the potential to turn Ireland from a climate change laggard into a leader.Prof Sweeney had raised concerns on Tuesday about references to methane in the document, which was received by some as him opposing the programme.However, in a video message yesterday he clarified his position saying he supported the programme in the round, while disagreeing with some inidual issues.“Pragmatically, this is the best deal we are going to get in the near future and I am supporting it,” he said.While TDs campaigning to adopt the programme for government have said they have received positive feedback, it was accepted that the opposition to the deal is much larger than it was in 2007, when only a handful of members publicly opposed it.“There is certainly a more vocal and organised opposition than there was in 2007,” said Gavin Nugent, the chair of the Young Greens.Party sources said yesterday that the votes of the 800 members based in Northern Ireland could also be critical to the outcome on Friday. Neither the Northern Green organisation, nor its 10n public representatives (two MLAs and eight councillors), has as yet taken a public position on the programme. Northern leader Clare Bailey abstained when a vote was taken by the wider parliamentary party on Monday night, on the basis that she had not had the opportunity to read the document in its entirety.The party needs to get approval from two thirds of its members if it is to enter coalition.‘Jeopardised’The national executive of Young Fine Gael yesterday unanimously voted to instruct its three representatives on the party’s executive council to vote against the deal.In a statement, it said: “It is our members’ view that (the party’s) values and Fine Gael’s distinct identity, will be irreparably jeopardised by entering into a government with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.”Ógra Fianna Fáil yesterday restated its opposition to a coalition with Fine Gael. Its chair, Tom Cahill, it said: “We cannot reconcile the neglect the country has endured under Fine Gael in government. We fought and campaigned hard to remove them from office in this year’s general election.”The Young Greens have yet to adopt a formal position on coalition. Mr Nugent said yesterday it would do so after the party’s special convention.However, Mr Nugent said the preponderance of sentiment among the Young Greens was to vote against.He said the concerns raised by younger members of the party included he lack of costings, timelines and delivery plans. “There is a fear of history repeating itself,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274713.1591714317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prof denis o sullivan the irishman who shone light on cosmic rays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Denis O’Sullivan. Analysed moon rocks brought back by Neil Armstrong on board the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Photograph: Eric LukeIf you are resorting to virtual table quizzes to break the Covid-19 lockdown boredom, try this question: who links these three things – moon rocks, high-energy physics and watercolour painting?This is a tricky one unless you knew that an Irish scientist was among the very first in the world to receive and begin analysing the moon rocks brought back by Neil Armstrong on board the Apollo 11 spacecraft.The link in this case is Prof Denis O’Sullivan, a high-energy physicist based at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS). He got his PhD at the institute back in 1966 and was still an emeritus professor at the institute right up to his death on February 27th last.He built a career on the study of cosmic rays, ephemeral but powerful particles that travel at close to light speed and reach us from the sun and sources in deep space. Astronomers speculate about where they come from, for example supernova explosions and other cataclysmic events out at the fringes of the universe.While we don’t know the source, we do see the results in the form of incoming cosmic rays. These are mostly protons but some are much heavier atomic nuclei and because of their speed they are extremely powerful – and potentially damaging.Lucky for the residents of Earth, the planet’s magnetic field channels cosmic rays away towards the poles and almost all the rest are rendered near-harmless by our atmosphere.That is fine for us down at the surface but the higher you go – for example up a mountain or in a commercial aircraft – the higher the radiation exposure. You absorb about one chest X-ray’s worth of radiation in a flight from Dublin to New York. Now move higher still, up to where astronauts orbit. Radiation levels climb with altitude and the flux of cosmic rays increases to the point that they pose a serious safety risk. Beyond the atmosphere there is nothing to protect you in the event of a solar flare.Capture dataIt was in this research area – measuring and studying cosmic rays and developing devices to capture data – that Denis O’Sullivan worked, and at such an advanced level that he became of interest to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). It was moving quickly towards a manned flight to the moon and it wanted to better understand radiation exposures in open space beyond the protections offered by Earth.At this time O’Sullivan was studying ways to use specialised plastics to measure radiation exposure, working with institute colleague Alex Thompson. O’Sullivan temporarily moved on sabbatical to the research lab of P Buford Price at University of California, Berkeley, where similar work was being done. Nasa agreed to support research with Price for the development of detectors and O’Sullivan was a central part of the team.He was there from 1969 through early 1972 and the team developed a device that could measure cosmic radiation. It needed refinement so could not fly on Apollo 11 but versions were carried to the moon fixed to the leg of the moon lander on Apollo 16 and 17. One of the devices brought back from the moon is now on display at the National Museum.This work put O’Sullivan at the forefront of radiation detection and safety and established a research link with Nasa that carried throughout his long career.And what of the watercolours? O’Sullivan took up painting in the 1950s and became an accomplished artist, exhibiting at the royal academies in Dublin, London and Belfast.Denis O’Sullivan (1938-2020). Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anamIn the right place at the right timeDenis O’Sullivan was on research sabbatical at University of California, Berkeley in 1969 a classic case of being at the right place at just the right time. He was in the lab of P Buford Price who had just agreed a research project with Nasa to develop detectors to measure radiation exposures to astronauts. O’Sullivan had been involved in similar work in Dublin and the race was on to develop them.It was an exciting time in the lab but also on the tumultuous Berkeley campus. It had long been a hotbed of protest and dissent and O’Sullivan witnessed student marches, police charges and the arrival of the California National Guard.He had taken up a research position and was there with his wife, Carmel Madden, and children Tanya and Gavin, who were little more than toddlers at that time.The cosmic ray detectors were blocks of a specialised plastic that when struck by a cosmic ray particle would excavate a telltale track in the block. The more particles colliding with the detectors, the more tracks and the more information. It was not simply a counting operation the tracks provided a wealth of data that helped to identify the particle causing the track.O’Sullivan had also studied whether cosmic ray tracks could be trapped by other materials and this opened up the possibility of searching for tracks left behind in moon rocks.The rocks brought back from the moon in question arrived early in 1970 and O’Sullivan was in the midst of it with Price and his team looking for cosmic rays from the sun, and O’Sullivan looking for cosmic rays from deep space. He continued this analysis on his return to Dublin working with his long time collaborator Alex Thompson. This work ensured that DIAS was in the international spotlight as a leading research centre."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Batons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279823.1592246043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu prepares to knuckle down for summer of brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson participates in a video-conference call on Monday with European Council president Charles Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Parliament president David Sassoli and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Stephane LemoutonAFPIreland has won a seat on the UN Security Council, in a major boost for the country’s foreign policy credentials.Ireland secured 128 votes – exactly the two-thirds majority needed to qualify – in a vote at UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday.Norway was also elected in the first round, securing 130 votes. In a blow to Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, Canada failed to win a seat – the second time it has lost a bid over the last decade.Ireland’s two-year term on the 15-member council will begin in January and will mark the fourth time the country has held a seat on the influential international body.Ireland’s ambassador to the United Nations, Geraldine Byrne Nason, had been leading efforts to secure a seat on the council in New York, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney liaised with countries across the globe in an effort to drum up support for Ireland’s bid.At a press conference in Government Buildings, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste both said Ireland had “punched above its weight”.Tough electionMr Varadkar said it had been a “tough election” and the contest against Canada and Norway made it the “group of death”.“We are a small country that has a big presence and is a force of good,” he said. He said the fact that Ireland was the only member of the EU vying for the position was a factor, as was our relationship with African and island states and the work done by the Irish Defence Forces in the UN.“For a small country, we have a lot of influence,” said Mr Coveney, adding that the result showed a lot of countries respected the good standing that Ireland has had.Both said the €800,000 spent on the campaign was justified, and noted it was half that spent by Norway and Canada.“It was money well spent to ensure that Irish values and Irish foreign policy is shaping global decision-making for the next two years,” said Mr Coveney.While Norway had been expected to be elected in the first round, Ireland’s qualification in the first round of voting was particularly noteworthy. Voting had been expected to stretch into a second round on Thursday.Ireland’s track record on foreign development aid, its history as a colonised country and affinity with other small nations, as well as its commitment to UN peacekeeping, are likely to have persuaded its fellow UN members to support the bid.Peace processIn addition, Ireland was the only country in its group that is a member of the European Union. Its stance on the Middle East peace process and support for the two-state solution is also likely to have sat well with Arab nations.President Michael D Higgins, who hosted several events during the UN General Assembly in New York last September to highlight Ireland’s international credentials and track record on climate change and poverty reduction, congratulated those involved in the bid, noting that the campaign “engaged with global issues, such as peace-building and peacekeeping, the elimination of global poverty, the strengthening of multilateralism, and reform of the United Nations.”Former US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who was born in Ireland, was among those who congratulated Ireland on its campaign.Goal’s chief executive, Siobhan Walsh, said the result “both speaks to our ambition as a nation to meaningfully contribute to the global community, while representing an acknowledgement by other nations of Ireland’s unique offering to the world”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

This is what they intend to convey to the Independent Commission of Inquiry.“Both of these decisions were reached after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection, and with the full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world.”The statement came after the majority of both undergraduates and postgraduates studying at Oriel had this week voted in favour of the statue being removed. Carole Souter CBE, the current master of St Cross College and former chief executive of the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was immediately appointed as the independent chairman of the inquiry - which it said would continue “at pace” and report back by the end of the year.As well as dealing with “the issue of the Rhodes legacy”, the inquiry will also explore “how to improve access and attendance of BAME undergraduate, graduate students and faculty, together with a review of how the College’s 21st Century commitment to ersity can sit more easily with its past”.The statement added that the inquiry would “approach a number of  iniduals drawn from the worlds of academia, education policy, law, politics and journalism, adding:  “The commission is intending to draw upon the greatest possible breadth and depth of experience, opinion and background.”It said written and oral evidence will be taken from a broad range of stakeholders from Oxford and the country, including students, representatives of Rhodes Must Fall and Oxford city council, as well as alumni of Oxford and Oriel and citizens of the city.“The Governing Body believes that this decision will allow a serious, appropriate and productive resolution of a complex series of issues,” the statement added. The statement came after Oriel’s Governing body met for several hours on Wednesday afternoon amid rising tensions in Oxford following the recent Black Lives Matter protests. Students have been writing dozens of letters to vice-chancellor Prof Louise Richardson and College heads demanding that institutional racism be tackled. On Wednesday, Prof Richardson was criticised by 14 of her university’s own professors who accused her of making “unwarranted claims” about Nelson Mandela after she quoted the former President of South Africa as saying: “Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment.”Writing for the , the dons warned Prof Richardson that she should not “presume to speak for black students or people of colour”, saying it was inappropriate for her to “ventriloquise” the late anti-apartheid leader. Prof Richardson hinted that Mr Mandela might not support the Rhodes Must Fall campaign because “he was a man of deep nuance who recognised complex problems for what they were.” Pointing to a speech given by Mr Mandela in 2003 to launch the Mandela Rhodes Foundation, a partnership with the Rhodes Trust to offer scholarships to African students, she said: “He said that we have to acknowledge our past but focus on the future.”The letter was signed by Oxford academics including Robert Gildea, a professor of modern history, Elleke Boehmer, a professor of world literature and Miles Trendi, an associate professor in African politics and Faisal Devji, a professor of India history. A separate open letter was sent to the vice-chancellor this week from the university’s black and ethnic minority staff network, which accused her of “limited and inadequate” messages to staff about countering institutional racism. On Wednesday, Oriel students Neil Misra and Swaraj Dash, who continued the Rhodes Must Fall campaign that started in 2015, told the : We are absolutely delighted. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"companies britain linked slave trade say today","story":"Greene received nearly £500,000 in today\u0027s money when he surrendered rights to three plantations in the West Indies.There is also evidence that other partners of RBSG predecessors may have been part owners of ships involved in slave trading voyages during the 18th and 19th centuries.Layla Moran, a challenger for the Liberal Democrat leadership, said she would be writing to the bosses of companies highlighted in the UCL database, urging them to make donations to BAME causes.How Greene King is linked to the slave trade:How RBS is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyds Banking Group is linked to the slave trade:How RSA Insurance is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyd\u0027s of London is linked to the slave trade:What Lloyd\u0027s of London says today:How P\u0026ampO is linked to the slave trade:How Danske Bank is linked to the slave trade:How Barclays is linked to the slave trade:How HSBC is linked to the slave trade:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meant conservative government finally acting like one","story":"Is Theresa May still in charge? Has Sir Keir Starmer suddenly become Prime Minister? What’s happened to the ebullient, optimistic, can-do Boris? These were the questions that even the Prime Minister’s greatest fans had started to ask after the drift, chaos and lack of direction of the past few weeks.With Boris Johnson almost invisible, the Government felt rudderless, bogged down in detail, strangely unable to lead us out of lockdown, excessively risk-averse and in hock to discredited “experts”. It gave the impression of being blase about the calamitous economic, educational and welfarist cultural consequences of the never-ending lockdown and insufficiently self-confident to be able to admit publicly that the state apparatus had failed.Then came the hijacking of the anti-racist protests, the traducing of a heartfelt movement decrying the despicable murder of George Floyd in America, the lawlessness, the hard-Left and hard-Right protests, the smack of cultural revolution, the orgy of officially-sanctioned wokeness.Where was Boris? Wasn’t this meant to be a conservative, patriotic and competent government? Why was Churchill’s statue boarded up, and the mob allowed to tear down or deface with impunity in what purports to be a law-governed democracy? Where was the modern, anti-racist, pro-meritocracy, conservative side of the argument, the alternative narrative that Boris ought to have been so great at delivering?Priti Patel and others did a great job putting that argument, but it felt piecemeal. The void from the centre was mystifying. It was as if the virus had blown the Government up, that it was still suffering from shell-shock, its confidence shot to pieces by the death toll, its ability to readjust to a new political landscape severely impaired.Some of this was unfair: No 10 has been forced to micromanage much of the fight against Covid as a result of the failure of our nationalised health establishment. Massive improvements have been quietly pushed through. Johnson was exhausted: the coronavirus is exceptionally draining and damaging, and its victims take ages to recover fully. But political warfare isn’t fair, and the Government made unforced errors, not least in imposing a quarantine even on countries that have defeated the virus. Its inability to reopen schools has proved especially debilitating, as has its obsession with a two-metre rule that isn’t followed in nations that have reopened without a second wave.Yes, the Government is right to be worried: Covid is a terrible threat, and the number of cases is shooting up again in the US and elsewhere. But the only way forward is to reopen regardless, as France, Spain and Italy have done, to shift the narrative towards one of co-existence with a contained virus, to hope that new drugs and vaccines are arriving soon, to tell the public that they can go back to work, to put in place genuinely mass testing and tracing systems. We cannot lock down forever and we cannot afford to lock down again.The drift of the past two months has allowed the Left-wing establishment to reassert itself. The BBC has appointed one of its own as its new boss an ex-Treasury, ex-IMF, Left-wing think tanker was appointed as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility the CBI’s new boss used to advise Gordon Brown and work for the . The only economic policy we heard about – apart from the necessary spending of hundreds of billions to cushion the economy – were “green jobs”, state-infrastructure, government this and government that. The Left-liberal elites were beginning to hope again that Boris’ project was about to fail. The EU detected weakness, crashing the talks before seeking to prolong the transition.Yet with luck all of this is now history. The Government has finally launched its comeback, to the great relief of its base. It is holding firm on Brexit and reinjecting energy into the talks. Johnson sounds like himself his mojo is returning. The first real signs of this fightback came on Sunday, with the revelation of a crackdown against those defacing war monuments. We were also reminded that May’s gender-identifying reform plans would be ditched.Then Johnson wrote one of his classic, barnstorming articles for this newspaper. The new equalities commission, set up by the brilliant Munira Mirza, suggests an innovative, authentically liberal-conservative and anti-Marxist approach to tackling entrenched inequalities, racism and poverty. Kemi Badenoch, another Tory star who deserves to be promoted to the cabinet at the next reshuffle, will be leading the group. The significance of this endeavour and the excellence of the personnel selected for it cannot be underplayed.Next came the abolition of the Department for International Development, and its absorption into the Foreign Office. Australia and others have long since pushed through such a sensible reform, which will reduce waste, junkets and ineffective, counterproductive spending, and allow a unified foreign policy. It’s a great step in the right direction: the useless aid-industrial complex hates it.There have still been some missteps such as the fiasco over free school meals. It was never a battle worth fighting and should have been nipped in the bud. But the trend is hugely positive: Johnson was on his old form at PMQs, trouncing Starmer over the latter’s refusal to accept that it’s safe for children to return to school. His language is Johnsonian again: “A great ox has stood on your tongue”, he said of Starmer the aid reforms end “the great cashpoint in the sky”.Which takes us to the virus: Boris’s relaunch must extend to shaking-up the Government’s frightened approach. He needs to tell his Johnsonian stories again. Scientists can no longer be used as human shields. All schools will open fully in September, with no social distancing.

The UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of people would need to be infected to achieve herd immunity from the novel coronavirus.Sweden chose not to implement a strict lockdown, running contrary to many other countries worldwide. Schools, shops and restaurants have all remained open during the course of 2020. Instead, the government deferred to scientific advice and recommended Swedes observe social distancing. There had been expectations that this policy choice would have allowed Sweden to achieve herd immunity without imposing an economically and socially crippling lockdown.However, in an interview with Swedish Radio, Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u0027s chief epidemiologist, admitted that immunity rates were low and that “it’s difficult to explain why this is so.”Mr Tegnell and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven have long defended their softer approach to lockdown, stating the disease is not something that can be defeated with a short term fix but that nation’s must learn to live with the virus.A minute’s silence was observed in the country’s parliament to honour the 5,000 people who lost their lives.Andres Norlen, the parliamentary speaker, said “parliament is mourning.

Though they must come from some very extreme, intense part of the universe, there is no way of knowing what process gives rise to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe first FRB was picked up in 2007 and scientists have gone on to find more than 100 since. Initially, they were detected only as inidual blasts, but in recent times researchers have found repeating sources.Now astronomers have started to find bursts repeating in a pattern, where they seem to switch off and on in a predictable pattern.Scientists find exact location of radio blasts coming from spaceThe latest discovery sends out random bursts of radio waves over a four-day window, and then goes quiet for 12 days, before beginning again.Researchers watched the bursts for more than 500 days, noting that the 16-day pattern occurred consistently over that time, making it the most definitive pattern yet seen.“This FRB we’re reporting now is like clockwork,” says Kiyoshi Masui, assistant professor of physics in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.“It’s the most definitive pattern we’ve seen from one of these sources. And it’s a big clue that we can use to start hunting down the physics of what’s causing these bright flashes, which nobody really understands.”The discovery is reported in a new article, titled \u0027Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source\u0027, published in Nature today.The latest FRBs were picked up by CHIME, a radio telescope in British Columbia that began its work in 2017. Since then, it quickly started picking up FRBs, using a technique that allows it to stare at the entire sky rather than moving around if and when any burst is detected.The repeating nature of the burst could give new insight into where they are coming from.Possibilities include one single object such as a neutron star that is spinning and wobbling in space. That could explain the pattern to the blasts, since the 16-day period may be the time it takes for the object to spin around, with the four days of activity the ones in which it is pointing towards us.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pattern could be the result of the orbit between , and the interaction between the two objects, which would explain their regular pattern, scientists say.Another involves a static radio source that is going around a central star – that star could be letting out a cloud of gas that magnify the radio emissions and send them powerfully towards Earth. The repeating pattern could therefore be an indication of when that source travels through its clouds.The CHIME telescope works to keep exploring FRB, measuring one roughly each day. It will also keep watching the newly discovered burst, and any changes in its properties could offer an important hint about where it is coming from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So starting today, we’re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter — your very own voice,” Twitter designer Maya Patterson and engineer Rémy Bourgoin wrote in a blog post.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is possible to record for longer, however. “Have more to say? Keep talking. Once you reach the time limit for a tweet, a new voice tweet starts automatically to create a thread,” Twitter said.Messages longer than that will be automatically threaded, up to 25 tweets. This gives people a total of 3,500 seconds, or just under an hour, of voice content to upload, according to a Twitter help page.For now, voice tweets are only functional for stand-alone posts there is no way to quote-tweet with a voice note, or reply with one yet.Your voice note will be accompanied with your profile picture on the timeline, but that will not update if you change your image.On iOS, when users tap play, a dock will be created at the bottom of the app so people can continue listening as they scroll through Twitter, as well as when they leave the app.It is currently unclear how such tweets will be moderated by Twitter, at a time when the company is under pressure by the US government for its actions regarding Donald Trump’s account.Twitter adds fact-checking label to tweets linking pandemic with 5GMr Trump recently signed an executive order which limits protections given to all companies for user content on their platform – whether that’s a multinational corporation or a small blog – in a move that could have wide ramifications for the internet.This is not the only experiment Twitter is running on its platform. The company is also testing replying to tweets with emoji, prompting users to read articles before sharing them, and asking them to “revise” tweets that use rude or “harmful” language.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Their pledges are the among the first signs of the corporate sector being impacted by Britain’s recent reckoning with its history of slave trading.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGreene King was founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who was given what amounts to nearly £500,000 in today\u0027s modern in return for surrendering the rights to three plantations in the West Indies after the British Empire abolished slavery.He was one of 47,000 people who profited from compensation paid to slave owners after the abolition of slavery in 1833.Tiger King\u0027s Joe Exotic asks BLM to demand prison reformGithub swaps \u0027master and slave\u0027 terms for more inclusive languageLiverpool\u0027s Penny Lane \u0027could be renamed\u0027 if slave trader links provenNew Orleans protesters rip down bust of slave owner, throw it in riverThere is no excuse for Britain’s barbaric slave tradeGreene King makes no mention of its founder’s links to slavery on its company website, but the company’s chief executive Nick Mackenzie told The  the website would be updated on Thursday.“It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s,” he told the newspaper. “We don’t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners, as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.”Mr Mackenzie said Greene King would invest a “substantial” amount of money “to benefit the BAME community and support our race ersity in the business as we increase our focus on targeted work in this area”.Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s on London, was named in the database as having been paid nearly £400,000 in today’s money when he surrendered an estate in Dominica.A spokesperson for the insurer said: “We are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the 18th and 19th century slave trade. This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period.It is time schoolchildren were taught properly about the slave trade“We will provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups.”Other companies named on the list that benefited directly or indirectly from the slave trade include the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, HSBC, and Lloyds Banking Group.The database was compiled by UCL\u0027s Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership, and contains information about every slave-owner in the British Caribbean, Mauritius or the Cape at the moment of abolition.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

They also expect the overall welfare of the UK of the population to be slightly lower as a result of the deal. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run, with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand (between 0.00 per cent and 0.01 per cent in scenario 1 and -0.01 per cent and 0.00 per cent in scenario 2), the document says.However the trade deal would be slightly more beneficial to New Zealand itself, the government found, noting that GDP in New Zealand is estimated to see economic growth of 0.14 per cent or 0.35 per cent as a result of this FTA in scenario 1 and 2, respectively.UK and EU agree to intensify trade talks as Brexit deadline loomsExtend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesWhile the government expects a trade deal to slightly increase productivity and gross value added, its modelling also warns that not all areas of the country would benefit.In Northern Ireland, output may decrease relative to the baseline, reflecting a higher concentration of the agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, the document says. Exports to New Zealand are expected to increase by between 3.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent under the deal. The government expects there to be a significant increase in imports of New Zealand lamb coming to Britain.Overall the government projects that a substantial deal will reduce the welfare of the population. The document says: Headline welfare changes are limited under scenario 1 and are estimated to decrease by 0.01 per cent in scenario 2.Despite the potential damage to the UK economy from the deal, negotiations were formally launched on Wednesday, alongside talks with Australia.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK economy shrank by 20 per cent in April alone on the back of the coronavirus crisis.The government also admitted in March that its flagship trade deal with Donald Trump\u0027s United States would boost UK GDP by 0.16 per cent. However, the government is keen to sign trade deals with other countries to illustrate the benefits of leaving the European Union\u0027s customs union, in which Britain could not sign its own agreements but benefits from collective deals negotiated by the EU. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: Today\u0027s launch of trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand is a historic moment for this county.When we left the EU we did so on the promise of trading more with friends and allies across the world. Deals with Australia and New Zealand are a powerful expression of our newfound independence and our intent to build a global Britain.

The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively low value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe. When the 47 per cent of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging on the balance then that is where the government\u0027s priority should lie.Speaking at the Commons international trade committee on Wednesday, Nick von Westenholz director of EU exit at the National Farmers\u0027 Union said: There is a huge market of 450m consumers on our doorstep in very close proximity so it will remain hugely important market for us. Absolutely we should look for trade opportunities elsewhere around the world in the years ahead but none of those even collectively will make up for the significant damage agriculture might experience if we have a very hard end of the transition period next year. Absolutely the EU negotiation would be our priority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China ‘should take a step back’ on Hong Kong, Dominic Raab says“What you’re seeing with the merger is that we want to bring our world-beating aid budget and development expertise we’ve got in DfID right to the beating heart of foreign policy decision making and give not just taxpayers benefit but that have the maximum impact they need at this crucial time,” he said. “So I do think we are learning lessons from the crisis and trying to turn that into the kind of innovation which will sharpen our cutting edge in terms of foreign policy.” Addressing the issue of statues in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the foreign secretary also told Radio 4’s Today programme that the UK should be careful not to “airbrush” its history, but should “update it”. “One thing I do accept is that people will think that we ought to keep updating our history, and make sure the symbols reflect the spirit and the values of the age,” he added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will be removed.The decision was praised by California assemblywoman Lorena Gonzales, who also serves as the head of the Latino Caucus.“It’s important that children today learn the difference between real heroes and fake ones,” Ms Gonzales tweeted.The announcement by the leadership comes after statues of Columbus have been taken down across the US, in response to protests around racial injustice.Monuments to Confederate officials have also been removed in numerous states in the past couple of weeks, and House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has called for 11 monuments to be removed from the US Capitol.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is a feature of messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal, but not Facebook Messenger or text messages.Messages, or calls, that are not end-to-end encrypted are less private than those which are.Both free and paid users of Zoom will need to go through a one-time process when making calls to verify their identity, such as confirming a phone number through text message, in order to get end-to-end encryption.Account administrators would be able to enable end-to-end encryption on any group calls, in order to allow phone lines or older conferences room phones to access the call.“Many leading companies perform similar steps on account creation to reduce the mass creation of abusive accounts.

And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

To do something of meaning, to do something that matters.Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.They added: We look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right.The non-profit aims to offer classes, lectures, seminars, conferences, workshops, and retreats on a iety of topics, run a mentoring scheme, or conduct and host events and exhibitions for cultural, sporting, health, mental health and entertainment purposes, as well as the potential to self-publish articles, magazines, books, music, podcasts, television shows, and computer software.According to reports this week, they have delayed their plans until at least next year, as they focus their efforts on the Black Lives Matter movement and fighting COVID-.Describing how a public launch is now off the cards, a source told the Daily : Whats absolutely clear is that they want to get it right and theres no point in rushing.They are settling into a new le, a new era.

Specic measures used included the number of tests carried out per million people, the number of cancer-related surgeries cancelled, and excess deaths per million people. Preexisting risk factors such as levels of obesity, the number of people aged above , and the number of international arrivals were also taken into account. The most signicant reason for the UKs low score was its levels of excess deaths. The report singled out the countrys low levels of testing and a controversial decision to stop contact tracing in March as contributing factors. It added that the UKs position as an international travel hub, and the number of people passing through airports like Heathrow, could have played a part. The government has also been criticised for delaying the decision to lockdown until after the country was already seeing signicant spread of the virus. The UK has so far seen , deaths from the pandemic, signicantly more than any other country with a comparable population. Only Brazil and the US, whose populations are three and five times that of the UK respectively, have seen more deaths.In spite of its high death toll, the US performed well in the rankings once its initial risk factors were taken into account. In contrast to Britain, other poorly-performing countries like Spain and Italy were hit early on in the pandemic and had little time to prepare, the report said. It also said that the UKs centralised healthcare system meant the government had a wealth of public health data that should have aided its response.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An estimated one in five adults and one in six children dont get enough vitamin D - a problem that its feared could be being exacerbated by the lockdown. One study by Anglia Ruskin University found that European countries in which vitamin D deficiency is prevalent have seen elevated death tolls since the start of the pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, part of the Department of Health, has now announced a rapid evidence review looking at the trend, thereported. The results of the review are set to be published in the coming weeks. The Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which advises Public Health England and other government organisations on nutrition, will also complete a report. Heightened vulnerability caused by a lack of vitamin D could be part of the reason that both the elderly and certain ethnic minority groups have seen higher fatality rates from the virus.Melanin, the pigment that makes a persons skin darker, lowers the skins ability to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. The bodys ability to produce the vitamin also diminishes as a person gets older.  In April, Public Health England advised Brits to begin taking vitamin D supplements to help maintain bone and muscle health during the lockdown.Earlier this month, the Scottish government also recommended that anyone from an ethnic group with darker skin should begin taking the supplement. Officials are said to be discussing whether the supplement could be prescribed in hospitals to help mitigate the impact of any second wave.Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University, currently leading a study into the vulnerability to coronavirus of people with dferent lestyles, told the \" href\"https:www.the world  jun  uk-ministers-order-urgent-vitamin-d-coronavirus-review\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\" that the benefits of vitamin D could be considerable. Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections, he said.

What I originally thought was hideous, I am now looking forward to opening them soon.“Not in situ yet, but ideal for the more vulnerable guests. We will be taking bookings very soon.”Tourism body Visit Lancashire praised the move, saying the pub was “making the absolute best of a bad situation”. It is one of many creative ideas landlords have come up with to ensure their pubs can reopen without breaking the rules.The Strawberry Special in Draycott, Somerset, has installed perspex screens across the bar and set up hand sanitiser stations.It is also changing the layout of the tables to facilitate social distancing.Customers at Greene King pubs will enter and leave via a one-way system with markers on the floor telling you which way to go. A singing and shouting ban could also come into place when pubs finally reopen to help stop the spread of coronavirus.And boozers could be forced to switch loud music off so customers dont have to shout or talk loudly, which sprays the virus further.Pubs are hoping to reopen on July  but this has not yet been confirmed. Without a firm nod, many businesses say they will have to cut jobs or even close for good.Many have been offering takeaway pints to stay afloat while they wait for the go ahead.The Government is considering relaxing the two metre social distancing rule to make it easier for pubs, bars and restaurants to reopen. A reduction to just one metre would be in line with World Health Organization recommendations.The controversial rule appears to have already been relaxed in the workplace.Official government guidance told firms they must only follow it “where possible”, giving employers wriggle room.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Foreign Secretary also bizarrely claimed the gesture against police violence was from the Game of Thrones TV series during a live radio interview. And he said: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. The comments by the UKaposs chief diplomat - who is Boris Johnsonaposs deputy - risk sparking a fresh row over the governmentaposs response to Black Lives Matter protests.  Kneeling in protest for black people was popularised as a gesture in  by former San Francisco ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He knelt in protest against police brutality during the national anthem, prompting a furore over civil rights in the US. Kaepernick later said: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” But asked by TalkRadio todayhe would take a knee, Mr Raab said: I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement. Iaposve got to say on this taking a knee thing, I donapost know, maybe itaposs got a broader history but seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones, feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel dferently about it so itaposs a matter of personal choice. Asked againheaposd do it he said: [I] take the knee for two people - the Queen, and the missus when I asked her to marry me. It is not clear why Mr Raab thought the gesture was from Game of Thrones - although the show does include people kneeling in subjugation to a new ruler.  Twitter users accused Mr Raab of being ignorant and said his comments were absolutely disgraceful... white privilege in Ultra HD. TV host Piers Morgan tweeted: Unbelievable.. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab thinks taking the knee is from Game of Thrones. This Government continues to shame us to the world. Labour MP Diane Abbott said: “Taking the knee began in  with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. “They were protesting police brutality and racism. “But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!! Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: The fact our Foreign Secretary, who is also now going to be in charge of our aid budget, is totally ignorant about a global movement against racism is as shocking as it is concerning.  SNP MP Stephen Flynn tweeted a ‘face palm’ emoji adding: “He says he ‘understands’ but then goes on to say that he thinks take the knee comes from Game of Thrones. “How can the actual Foreign Secretary not know about Colin Kaepernick ” "},{"url":null,"title":"give schools resources need reopen","story":"NewsFour vital demands Boris Johnson must meet so our children can go back to schoolEXCLUSIVE: Experts, including those at Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, have called on Boris Johnson to fund and provide the resources to get kids back to schoolShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsA Year  pupil doing her work - but when will schools be able to fully reopen  \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Thousands of youngsters, particularly those from disadvantaged families, face a ruined educationthey are not able tosafely in September.We urge the PM to find alternative class space, fund extra teachers, give poor kids free internet and help those who have fallen behind. Lib Dem Layla Moran said: “Schools need more resources. Mr Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles.” As millions of children face six months out of class, medical and educational chiefs are also urging the PM to give schools the resources they need to reopen this autumn. Union leaders, medical and education chiefs, backed by the Mirror’s campaign, are warning that the poorest and most vulnerable children will struggle to close the attainment gap. Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said top doctors have a “very real concern” for children’s health. More than , paediatricians have also signed an unprecedented open letter to the PM, calling for a clear plan for getting children back to school. Teachers’ leaders warned yesterday that England’s schools would not be able to fully reopen after the summer holidays under current distancing rules requiring just  pupils in a class. Today, the Mirror is calling for the Government to work with parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders to get children back into school. We want ministers to to find alternative spaces, such as church halls, community centres, sports venues and libraries to give schools the space they need to maintain social distancing. Heads should be given funding to hire extra staff, including supply and trainee teachers and –it’s safe for them – recently retired teachers. The poorest children should be given free internet and equipment to narrow the ide, so no child is left behind.  And we need a massive catch-up programme to run over the over the summer, and beyond, to help those who have missed out on education at home. Prof Viner said: “Children need their schools. Every child deserves to have an uninterrupted education. But teachers do so much more than teach and schools provide so much more than education. Schools are vital to the wellbeing of children, providing a range of services from vaccinations to mental health support. Schools are also where at-risk children are looked out for and supported. Schools are also where our children run around, play and laugh and argue with each other. They need toto that sort of a healthy normality as soon as possible.”  Lib Dem’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: “Making our High Streets Covid-secure is critical. But it seems the Prime Minister is more concerned about allowing betting shops to re-open than getting children safely back into school. “It shows where the Government’s priorities lie. Schools urgently need the resources for more space and staff so that more pupils cansafely. Boris Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles, work with teachers and experts to agree a plan and stop treating our schools like a political football.” Labour Leader Keir Starmer told the Mirror: “It was Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who said on June  we’re not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer. I have said repeatedly that I want schools to reopen as soon as possible. I’ve offered to work with the Prime Minister to address this issue.” Coronavirusandschools.org.uk is giving parents and carers educational advice from real teachers while the schools are closed. The website has been set up by the National Education Union who represent almost half a million teachers and support staff. It features video tips from teachers, QAs on exams and tests, learning at home and child wellbeing. Plus there are fun activities parents can do with their children to stimulate their brains and keep them learning.  Click here to check it out for advice, resources and useful links. Mr Starmer, who has sent his own children to school through the lockdown because his we works for the NHS, added: “This is a Government with a majority of , it has its responsibilities and it should be doing everything in its power to reopen schools as soon as possible. The PM wants all England’s children back in school from September, after six months of coronavirus disruption. But he has tried to sht the blame for the fact that many of those in the years that are eligible tohave not yet done so.  Government plans to bring in Years R,  and  are in chaos, and a third of England’s primary failed to do so by June . Proposals to bring back Years , ,  and  by the start of July had to be dropped after officials accepted there was not enough space to maintain social distancing. Distancing rules have left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons. Ministers have been urged to adopt more creative proposals, including taking a Nightingale approach – based on the temporary hospitals set up to treat Covid- patients – to schools by providing extra space in community centres and town halls.  They have also been told to make sure heads have enough funding to encourage recently retired and supply teachers back into the classroomit is safe for them to do so. Downing Street is planning to set out its “catch up” plans for the summer later this week, and further plans “within weeks” to get more children back into the classroom after the summer holidays. The PM’s official spokesman said: “The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. We’ll continue to encourage parents to have their kids back in school and I’m sure those numbers will continue to rise.” But Mr Johnson suggested that Labour and the trade unions were hampering efforts to reopen. He said: “The kids that can go to school, should go to school and wouldn’t it be a fine thingwe heard from all sides of the House that schools are safe to go to, rather than the wibble-wobble that we’ve heard from the Opposition ” But four education unions being quizzed by the Commons Education committee hit back, and demanded more clarity and action from the Government.  Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned MPs something would have to givethe Government wanted schools to open fully in September under current rules. “If the Government retains its social distancing rules, then they can’t [opne],” she said. “So that’s why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “[It’s] about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning.” Jon Richards, National Secretary at Unison, said “you have to have facilities set up” and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. Julie McCulloch, of the ASCL union, said: “If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. “That is by far the best solution. But we’re not able to do that at the moment within the Government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"home office interpreter laughed tried","story":"NewsHome Office interpreter laughed as I tried to recount being raped torture survivor claimsEXCLUSIVE: Harrowing testimonies in a report by charity Freedom from Torture says people fleeing persecution are treated like criminals in asylum interviews - with the charity saying lessons have not been learned from the Windrush scandalShareByDave Burke:,  JUN NewsThe Home Office is accused of treating torture survivors in an inhumane manner during asylum interviews\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The allegation comes from charity Freedom from Torture in a report published today but are denied by the Home Office, with a spokesman saying they do not recognise them.  Interpreters are not Home Office staff but employed on a contract basis.It is one of a harrowing series of accounts highlighted in the study, which alleges victims of torture are being sent back into the clutches of their abusers because of prejudice and poor information gathering. The study, by charity Freedom from Torture, warns there is an environment of disbelief, scepticism and suspicion at the Home Office - which means vulnerable asylum seekers fleeing persecution are being failed. The action group said inhumane treatment shows lessons have not been learned from the Windrush scandal. In one heartbreaking testimony, a rape survivor described a shocking exchange during her asylum interview, saying: There was a point when I was going to talk about rape and when I started to talk about it, the interpreter snickered and when I saw that, it stopped me in my tracks… It was like it was funny. I wasnapost joking. I couldnapost understand this behaviour. Describing the aggressive questioning they had endured, another said: I was crying out loud and shaking and literally lost myself in a room… Oh, my goodness gracious. So many questions. … I said, ‘Could you please stop talking about it  I can’t do that.’ He said, ‘No. I’m sorry. We have to ask you and you have to answer’. I was like a kid. Another incident saw a sobbing asylum seeker asked to say exactly how many times they had been beaten and raped, the report states. Freedom from Torture has called for a systematic overhaul of the asylum interview process, describing the treatment many applicants receive as inhumane. Following publication of the report, named aposBeyond Belief: How the Home Office fails survivors of torture at the asylum interviewapos, the charity said: More often than not torture survivors left the asylum interview feeling dehumanised, re-traumatised, and felt hopeless at getting a fair decision on their asylum claim.  According to the report, one torture survivor recounted: The caseworker didn’t even look at me at all. Not for a second. Not at all. He was treating me like a criminal. The charity said the high number of cases where asylum applications are rejected, only to be allowed on appeal demonstrate systematic failings. Its report concluded: A system that relies on the appeal process to correct its errors is inefficient, costly and inhumane. And the charity said: Home Office caseworkers who conduct interviews have a dficult job, dealing as they do with traumatic stories and vulnerable iniduals every day. There is no doubt, however, that the culture within the Home Office has created an environment of disbelief, scepticism and suspicion that has crept into the interview room.  Despite all the statements of regret from government ministers following exposure of the Windrush scandal, we are still waiting for the systemic overhaul that has been called for by so many of those with lived experience of the immigration process. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these allegations.We have a proud history of supporting asylum seekers and our caseworkers follow the latest Home Office guidance and receive extensive training before they are permitted to conduct asylum interviews."},{"url":null,"title":"patronising tory mp ordered apologise","story":"NewsPatronising Tory MP ordered to apologise for failing to declare directorshipsA standards report found Marcus Fysh made three breaches of the code of conduct for MPs - and took a patronising tone to the officials investigating himShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsTory MP Marcus Fysh has been ordered to apologise in Parliament \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Marcus Fysh, , was investigated over failing to declare the directorships on the Register of MPsapos Interests or reveal them to a select committee. The Commons Committee on Standards today found he made three breaches of the Code of Conduct for MPs. The watchdog said he was late to registering changes to three companies in which he had shareholdings should have registered his five unpaid directorships in  and should have declared his and his brother’s unpaid directorships to the International Trade and European Scrutiny committees when he joined them. In a damning judgement, the Committee said Mr Fysh did not act in bad faith - but there were aggravating factors once a probe began. The Committee said Mr Fysh took a deprecatory and, at points, patronising tone towards the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and raised unfounded questions about their objectivity. There were also unnecessary delays when he did not respond to requests in a timely manner - including missing four deadlines to reply. Mr Fysh accepted the conclusion about his shareholdings and apologised, but not the two conclusions about his directorships. That meant the matter was elevated from the lower-level Commissioner to MPs on the Commons Standards Committee. In total, the inquiry that began in October  took almost two years to complete.

Under a year-long scheme, they would offer one-to-one and small group lessons to pupils who have fallen behind after months out of school. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports the bolt-on learning will take the form of sessions at the end of the school day. That would mean while the school day wouldnapost be formally extended, many pupils would be kept at school for longer. That would come on top of the staggered arrival and finish times schools are already having to implement to maintain social distancing.  A Whitehall source told the newspaper: The best place for children to learn is in a school environment, so it makes sense to try and do catch-up work at school rather than trying to do it through home learning. There has rightly been a lot of focus on the impact on disadvantaged children but all children have missed out on their education so we need a catch-up programme that is open to everyone.

He addressed the French people from the city after the fall of France – and declared the war for his homeland was not over. De Gaulleaposs Appeal is widely considered to be the origin of the French Resistance to the German occupation during the Second World War.  Mr Macron is due to attend commemorations at Clarence House with Prince Charles, and will award London the Legion daposHonneur – Franceaposs highest accolade – for its role in sheltering de Gaulle during the conflict. Mr Johnson said four Frenchmen, Edgard Tupët-Thomé, aged , Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, , Hubert Germain also , and Pierre Simonet, , would be honoured by the UK. The veterans are being recognised for “services to the United Kingdom in the Second World War”, and they will be presented with their medals in the coming months. The quartet are the four surviving ‘Compagnons’ of the Order of Liberation and played a signicant role in paving the way for the Allies’ rapid advance through France following the D-Day invasion of Normandy in . The Prime Minister said: “Eighty years ago Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French Resistance, arrived in London knowing that the values of freedom, tolerance and democracy that Britain and France shared were under threat.  “He pledged that we would stand together to defend those values and protect our citizens from those bent on destroying us. “The four men we are honouring today – Pierre, Edgard, Daniel and Hubert – symbolise the enduring depth and strength of the friendship between our two countries. “They are heroes, and I am immensely proud that as a nation we are paying tribute to their courage and sacrice in defending us and the whole world from fascism. “The struggles we face today are dferent to those we confronted together  years ago. “But I have no doubt that – working side by side – the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead.” Following ceremonial events with the Prince of Wales, Mr Macron will head to No for talks with the PM. The leaders will view relics documenting de Gaulle’s time in London and his close partnership with Winston Churchill.  They will also watch a flypast by the Red Arrows and their French equivalent, La Patrouille de France. Unlike most foreign travellers arriving from abroad, Mr Macron will not have to self-isolate for  days after landing in the UK before being allowed out – despite Covid- rules. No said the premier and his officials would be spared quarantine because “the French delegation will fall within the exempted category of representatives of a foreign country or territory travelling to undertake business in the UK”.

Research by the Centre for Ageing Better suggests a fth of people in those age groups have seen their physical health deteriorate during lockdown, and over a third say their mental health has worsened. This Government has already decided to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now there are reports that the pension triple-lock is in its sights too.

The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

Questions such as aposWhere you going on holiday apos or aposWhat you up to this weekend apos are to be discouraged during hair washing. Instead,they get the go-ahead to reopen in early July, hairdressers are being asked to observe a apossilence ruleapos. The National Hair and Beauty Federationhas advised members to keep chat to a minimum to protect both staff and customers. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   It comes as the federation is urging the Government to publish full guidance as salons will need two weeks to redesign. In a letter to Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, NHBF has expressed disappointment that “despite a real sense of progress” no official guidance is yet available. One hairdressing group, meanwhile, has already told its staff not to talk to customers whilst theyaposre having their hair washed and head massaged. Contemporary Salons, which has shops throughout the North East and North Yorkshire will make sure all staff have PPE.  Customers will also take part in a aposvirtual consultationapos so theof appointment can be assessed. Alan Simpson, Managing Director, said salons would be looking at aposmaintenance appointmentsapos to begin with before making more complicated sessions available in the coming weeks. No formal decision has been made by the Prime Minister on when salons and barber shops will be allowed to reopen. The National Hair and Beauty Federationare advising members to talk to clients side by side looking into the mirror and to limit discussions. Their advice issued to barbers and walk-in salons is: Avoid face-to-face discussions with clients. Discussions about cut, colour and treatments should be made via the mirror while standing behind the client and kept to a minimum. You can lower the risk of infectionyou stand or sit side-to-side rather than facing people. Consider offering online consultations to reduce the appointment time. “This could be done before your salon or barbershop is fully open for business. This also gives you an opportunity to talk to clients about safety measures you’re taking to protect them and your team and to establishan allergy alert test is needed.Other tips include urging customers not to bring coats or jackets into salonsthe weather is good because the virus can stay on fabrics for days.And salons have been encouraged to put out a slotted container for tips. A spokesman for NHBF said: Salons are putting their own rules in place based on common sense and trying to limit contact with clients as much as possible.

While the exact impact the vitamin can have is not yet known, the Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition began studying the potential impacts last month. At the same time the National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceis conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D in the context of Covid-.Last month Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge found a crude relationship between vitamin D levels and high mortality rates.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. People in countries like Italy and Spain, where the elderly tend to avoid strong sunlight, were more likely die to die from the coronavirus than those in northern European countries, where cod liver oil and vitamin d supplements were more regularly consumed. Dr Lee Smith, Reader in Physical Activity and Public Health at Anglia Ruskin University, said: “We found a signicant crude relationship between average vitamin D levels and the number COVID- cases, and particularly COVID- mortality rates, per head of population across the  European countries. “Vitamin D has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by COVID-. “A previous study found that % of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes, were severely deficient in vitamin D.  We suggest it would be advisable to perform dedicated studies looking at vitamin D levels in COVID- patients with dferent degrees of disease severity.”  The UK does not fare well when it comes to vitamin D consumption however. One in five British adults and one in six children is lacking in vitamin D, thanks to poor diets, indoor lestyles and lack of sunshine. Experts have expressed fears that the lockdown and months of indoor living have cut levels even further. Some ethnic groups are at higher risk, because their skin is less able to produce the vitamin in response to sunlight, while the elderly are typically less efficient at vitamin D production.

Amid rising racial tensions in Bristol, two headstones marking the burial place of -year-old Scipio Africanus, who lived in the city in the th century, were smashed up and message was left reading: Put Colstonaposs statue back or things will really heat up. It comes after the statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston was toppled in the centre of the city earlier this month during Black Lives Matter protests, and a statue to Jamaican playwright and actor Alfred Fagon was attacked with bleach.A message scrawled in chalk near the Scipio Africanus grave  included a warning for Black Lives Matter demonstrators and the local council, the Bristol Post reports. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Written on flagstones near the grave, it read: Now look at what you made me do. Stop protesting. Leave Elliottaposs grave alone. Put Colstonaposs statue back or things will really heat up. Police have launched an investigation and are reviewing CCTV from the area. The Grade II-listed, brightly painted memorial to Scipio, who died in , is situated in St Maryaposs churchyard in Henbury, Bristol. The tomb is an early example of a memorial to a man born into slavery and who ended his le as a servant in an English aristocratic household, Historic England states on its website.  It is thought the reference to Elliottaposs grave is music hall star GH Elliott, who used to perform in blackface as the aposChocolate Coloured C**napos. The gravestones of Elliott and and fellow music hall singer Alice Banford, who also wore blackface, were inscribed with their offensive stage names, and both were removed from St Margaretaposs Church in Rottingdean, East Sussex, on Monday. Their removal was authorised by the Chancellor of Chichester Diocese. It came after the Archdeacon of Brighton and Lewe, Martin Lloyd Williams, said he wanted to remove the deeply offensive gravestones. Banfordaposs gravestone, previously located next to Elliottaposs, was engraved with the words C**n singer and dancer. The performers both died in . In Bristol, the councillor who represents the ward that is home to the slaveaposs desecrated grave is now appealing for anyone who witnessed the latest vandalism to contact the police.Sharing a photo of the desecrated spot on Facebook, Cllr Mark Weston said: Sadly late last night the listed grave of aposScipio Africanusapos in St Maryaposs Churchyard, Henbury was badly damaged.This looks like a retaliation attack for the recent events involving the Colston statue. I am deeply saddened by what is happening.We have seen war memorials defaced and statues vandalised and I have to wonder where this will end. Our history is not simple, and a personaposs actions are rarely clear cut. Our nationaposs past is an intricate web of greatness, atrocity, heroism and villainy. We have good people that do bad things, bad people that occasionally strive for redemption and everything in between. This confusion becomes especially evident as we apply the lens of modern morality to the actions of centuries past.  If anyone has any information on this latest vandalism then I would urge you to contact the police. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees has called for calm and urged people not to carry out tit for tat racially motivated attacks. He said: [Scipioaposs grave] is an iconic piece of Bristolaposs history and that has been smashed in two with a message left scrawled on the floor around that. We just donapost want to go down the route. We donapost want to go down this tit-for-tat invisible attacks on each other. Little is known about Scipio, who was servant to Charles Howard, the th Earl of Suffolk. Historians believe he was the son of an enslaved West African woman. He was given his name by the Earl or by a previous owner. It is thought he was named after the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, known for defeating the Carthaginian military leader Hannibal in the third century. Names of Roman origin were frequently chosen for enslaved people, Historic England states. Most of the available information about Scipio is inscribed on his tomb, according to Historic Englandaposs website. The headstone, which features black cherubs, states he was born in about  and died on December  . Howard had a large house in the Henbury area. It is thought that Scipio was a well-loved member of the household. It was rare for an enslaved person to have a formal grave within a churchyard - let alone such an ornate one.  An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: We have received a report of criminal damage to a monument at Henbury Parish Church. We believe the incident occurred between pm on Tuesday  June and am on Wednesday  June. Our investigation into what happened is at an early stage.Officers have been at the scene and have carried out house-to-house and CCTV enquiries.  Anyone with information is asked to call  and give reference number .” Demonstrators used roped to pull down the Colston statue, erected in , during protests in Bristol city centre on June . It was then rolled into Bristol Harbour near Peroaposs Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in the city - and retrieved by the council on June . The act sparked a debate over the future of statues and monuments which celebrate long-dead figures who were involved in the slave trade."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast met office","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Met Office warning extended as thunderstorms smash nationScotland could see highs of C but much of England and Wales can expect a fresh wave of thunderstorms and heavy downpours before even the warm humidity deserts Britain by the weekendShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video weather-thursday-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-forecast-met-office-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But while England and Wales batten down the hatches, areas of Scotland could see highs of C. The Met Office had also issued two yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms yesterday, covering a large portion of the country, before floods caused chaotic scenes. BBC forecaster Stav Danaos described the weather outlook as slow moving thunderstorms, torrential downpours, gusty winds and some flash flooding issues in places. He said Wednesday saw some spectacular lightning bolts, with rain continuing into the night for many, though all Brits experienced a warm and muggy lead into Thursday. The rain across the south should spread northwards and westwards all the while against some heavy bursts in it, but generally it should be dry for much of Scotland and Northern Ireland, he continued.Loch Rannoch could see the peak of the warmth on Thursday, with the Met Office predicting a high of C by the afternoon, while Norwichaposs expected C is the hottest England can hope for. Given some sunshine and bright spells across southern England [and] South Wales, more thunderstorms will break out into the afternoon, said Mr Danaos. Again, like the last few days, they could cause some problems.  Friday will see storms developing in central, northern and eastern areas and it could also be the last of the warm and humid air. The forecaster said the weekend will see a big change, feeling windier and fresher as an Atlantic low sweeps across our shores.

They will have travelled from Scotland and once across the Channel will continue their gruelling journey through France and into Spain and possibly beyond, into North Africa, where the animals can be slaughtered in unspeakable conditions. It will be the first shipment of livestock from the port since March . Lockdown put a temporary halt to this dreadful trade, sometimes in sheep and sometimes in calves so young that they have not been weaned.Back in , Boris Johnson called the practice barbaric and agreed with campaigners saying farm animals should be slaughtered in this country and then exported – “on the hook, not on the hoof”.Itaposs a view backed by many in his party, The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation tweeting this week: “Ban this miserable trade”. Few people, Conservative or otherwise, would disagreed. But instead of action we’ve had preication. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the Government was committed to ending the practice and is swinging into inaction by saying it will be “launching a public consultation in due course”.Worse, the Scottish Government is actively opposing a judicial review launched by Compassion in World Farming, which argues that journeys for calves of over eight hours with no food or water breaks are unlawful.“The Government has hinted strongly that it wants to end this trade but has done nothing,” said CIWF’s chief policy adviser Peter Stevenson. Thereaposs been no discernible action. “The Scottish Government says it wants to consult with stakeholders and wants the judicial review to be postponed. These calves are not being fed on the trucks or unloaded into facilities where they are being fed, so the Scottish Government should not be authorising these journeys of over eight hours. Lawyers on behalf of Defra as well as the Scottish Government have filed oppositions to our case. Itaposs an utterly hypocritical situation of a Government including the Prime Minister indicating pretty strongly to the public that theyaposd like to ban live exports, yet when a court case comes along saying that the export of calves is already illegal, they formally oppose it. “I am so disappointed and angry.”A Scottish Government spokesman would not comment on the judicial review while proceedings are ongoing but said it was “committed to consulting” on the issue. So, more talk, less action. Which sums up progress in Wales on another burning animal welfare issue, Lucy’s Law. This has already come into force in England where it is now illegal for puppies to be sold by shops and anyone  who is not the breeder, dealing a hammer blow to cruel commercial breeders who hide behind closed doors.Yet Wales, which is the epicentre of the mass commercial breeding of puppies in the UK, has still not acted.Next month it will be two years since I joined a rally at the Welsh Assembly in support of urgent change, but the optimism of that day, which saw a unanimous backing for Lucy’s Law, has been followed by disappointment and delay.Lesley Grfiths, Welsh minister for the Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, said last week that she wants new regulations to come into force “as quickly as possible”, while saying there should first be consultation with “key stakeholders” including, bizarrely, children. A Welsh Government spokesman said “work on new legislation to ban the third-party sale of puppies is under way”. Conservative member of the Welsh parliament, Andrew RT Davies, has called the delay a ­travesty, tweeting: “Pull your finger out Welsh Labour Government!”  Eileen Jones runs Friends of Animals Wales, which has long been rescuing dogs that are dumped by puppy farms when they become too sick to breed. “We are totally disillusioned by a process that seems to go nowhere,” she says. “Puppy farmers are reporting that business is booming as they meet purchasers at motorway service stations and car parks. The selling price of a puppy has rocketed and this has had a massive reduction on the numbers of ex-breeding stock being handed in. Whilst at the very beginning of the lockdown there was an increase in requests for us to take in dogs, once so many members of the public started doing online searches for puppy sales advertisements and the farmers started receiving hundreds of responses many of them have said they are hanging on to the breeding dogs because demand is so high. “If Lucy’s Law had been law in Wales it would have been much harder to sell them and offenders could have been fined. “How incredibly sad that not only have many puppy purchasers faced the heartbreak and financial repercussions of buying sick pups, the poor mothers who should have gained their freedom have been retained to churn out more litters. We are also gearing ourselves up for the expected tsunami  of unwanted older puppies when ownersto work and they have a dog that causes mayhem and is distressed at being left alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harrys archewell trademark application","story":"NewsMeghan and Harry’s Archewell trademark application rejected as plans are ‘too vague’The trademark - inspired by their sons name Archie - has fallen foul of the United States Patent and Trademark Office after it deemed the nature of the non-profits work as \"too vague\"ShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video meghan-markle-details-experience-racism-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news meghan-harrys-archewell-trademark-application-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The notice demands a number of changes which need to be made by the coupleaposs attorney by August - or the application will be thrown out. The notice reads: The wording aposproviding a website featuring content relating to philanthropy, monetary giving, volunteer and career opportunitiesapos in International Class  is also indefinite and over broad, and must be claried to specy the nature of the content provided.  The notice also states that Meghan and Harry have failed to cough up additional fees to process the application. To make matters worse the non-final office action was unsigned which meant that the application could not be veried. Despite this, their trademark can be held without being active until the amendments are made. Harry and Meghan are launching Archewell, a well-being empire that is named after their son Archie, which will reportedly run emotional support groups and a multi-media educational empire.  The couple said Archewell was created to do something of meaning, to do something that matters. The Duke and Duchess told the Daily : Like you, our focus is on supporting efforts to tackle the global Covid- pandemic but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how this came to be. Before SussexRoyal, came the idea of aposArcheapos - the Greek word meaning apossource of actionapos.  We connected to this concept for the charitable organisation we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our sonaposs name.  "},{"url":null,"title":"photographer stunned brides cancellation message","story":"NewsPhotographer stunned by brides cancellation message - and cheeky deposit demandA shocking exchange between a wedding photographer and bride-to-be about the Black Lives Matter movement has gone viral after it was shared on social mediaShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsShe was shocked by the message\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

One such person who has been vocal about the cause is photographer, Shakira Rochelle.Shakira has shared posts on Instagram and Facebook, writing: Shakira Rochelle Photography stands in solidarity with the black community.The black lives matter movement has my endless support. And while many applauded her for sharing these posts, there were some who didnapost exactly agree with the statement.The photographer was recently left stunned when a bride who had hired her services for her big day messaged to cancel the job, over the BLM post. The unnamed bride-to-be explained that sheaposd seen the post and would now be truly embarrassed to have Shakira working at her wedding.A screenshot of the message went viral after being shared on Twitter.It read: Hi Shakira, Iaposm sorry to say that we are requesting a refund on the deposit for our wedding. We have done a lot of talking and we cannot bring ourselves to support anyone who is so outspoken on matters that simply do not concern them as well as someone that does not believe that ALL lives matter.  We would be truly embarrassed to have you at our event and feel that you arenapost stable enough to complete the job we need from you. Please let me know when and how we can expect our refund and we are requesting to be relieved from our contract. Thanks.Shakira had the perfect response, informing the bride that she would be using their non-refundable deposit to make a donation to Black Lives Matter. She said: I am sorry to hear that. Unfortunately the contract you signed states that your deposit is non-refundable.  I will email you a cancellation agreement shortly that will require your signature to forfeit your date. She added: I wish you a le time of growth and I would like to thank you for your donation to Black Lives Matter.The messages were shared on Twitter by a user named Q who posts under @PINKdot_COM where they garnered over one million likes and thousands of retweets.The tweet was captioned: I love it here. Q later shared Shakiraaposs business details so people could support her work. Following some backlash, in which she was accused of attempting to aposprofitapos off the Black Lives Matter movement, Shakira shared a statement about the viral post on Facebook. She admitted sheaposd never intended for it to go viral. I was hoping to lay low until this frenzy blew over but today I woke up to something that hurt my soul. There is a photoshopped screenshot circulating stating that coming forward with this story was a business tactic to make a profit on the blm movement, she wrote.

So far sheaposs had numerous cosmetic procedures to her lips, cheeks, chin, and jawline, as well as an eyebrow lt, lt lip, two nose jobs, veneers and Botox. She wants a full head-to-toe transformation, and is willing to go to extreme s to get her dream appearance. She said: “Facial feminisation is one of my big procedures I have planned as I’m trans and have certain features on my face that I don’t like. Although I’ve been changing my appearance for a few years now, I know this is just the start for me!

She makes thousands of pounds each month by sharing saucy photos of herself online, specialising in financially degrading men.

She said: I started off escorting then quickly realised there is this whole world of findomand cash pigs and cash slaves.  My mind was blown and I’ve not looked back since. Just this morning I woke up to a text from a guy asking methere’s anything he’d like me to do today. I told him, ‘yes, start by emptying your bank account into mine and then I want you to write lines saying, I must obey goddess Sofia Lips’ and he sent me £ and is still writing lines. She had some very bizarre requests since starting the unusual role, and she claims that some men just ask to meet her at cashpoints. They enter their pin and allow her to withdraw however much money she likes. She said: Some men are very strange.

The mouse initially appeared very still, stuck between the blinds and the window of a parlour in Pescara, Abruzzo, east Italy. But suddenly it seems to burst into le and starts running, causing two terried women monitoring its movements to scream and run away. Local media said police along with the Service of Food and Nutrition performed a full inspection of the ice cream shop. Traces of rodent were found and the shop was temporarily closed.

His research revealed more than a dozen subterranean maritime facilities which the dictatorship can use to repair and refuel warships, as well as launch attacks, in safety and secrecy. The bases – one of which is less than a mile from a private Kim Jong-un residence – also offer a place to shelter from enemies, but Mr Bogle claims they have a crucial flaw.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     “Kim Jong-un has invested huge sums of money in modernising the country’s conventional forces and related facilities,” he said. “Improvements to their naval assets have already been seen across the country. “But all underground facilities have one giant weakness: their entrances. Destroy those and whatever is inside becomes useless.” Given North Korea’s attempts to develop submarine-launched nuclear missiles, the signicance of these bases could be enormouswar broke out, Mr Bogle said.“Unlike the US or UK, which only have a few submarine-related bases – none of them underground – the fact that North Korea has so many creates added challenges for any preemptive strike,” he said. “It would require a near simultaneous attack on all of the bases to confidently knock out their submarine capability. “Otherwise some vessels may escape and go on to threaten any adversarial forces in the area. “Additionally, North Korea intends to build a submarine fleet capable of firing nuclear weapons – submarine-launched ballistic missiles . “Knowing where those submarines are housed prior to any future attack would be paramount.” In images collected by Mr Bogle, several navy bases can be seen to have waterways leading from the sea and into tunnels. While the exact scale of the tunnels is unknowable, some of them appear to have two access points, allowing us to draw a line between the exit and entrance to reveal the tunnel’s potential size. “One cannot tell by looking at commercial satellite imagery how complicated their interiors are,” said Jacob.“Do they have multiple side channels and galleries, for example  “But it is likely that at least some of the larger bases contain more than a single, narrow tunnelway within its respective mountain.” It’s also possible that another submarine base at Changjon, close to the South Korean border, could be brought back into action. It was closed during a period of co-operation between North and South, but now the two are at odds again, with Kim Jong-un blowing up a shared building in the border town of Kaesong on Tuesday.“As relations have deteriorated, that baseaposs strategic and propaganda value has grown,” said Jacob. “North Korea has destroyed the liaison office in Kaesong and committed to moving their military back into these demilitarised areas. “So there is a chance that the underground submarine base at Changjon could see reactivation sooner than expected.” Mr Bogle, who has created a comprehensive map of North Korea from satellite images, said the bases “were constructed several decades ago”.  “We know that they at least meet the level of sophistication found in other similar bases around the world during the s and s,” he said. “And imagery suggests that some entrances may have blast doors for defence as well as a system of devices to detect the presence of enemy submarines trying to infiltrate the base harbour.” North Korean submarines are outdated, Mr Bogle added, but he believes they remain a real danger to neighbouring countries. “North Korean submarines certainly are not a direct threat to the US,” he said.

The two-year-old boy is believed to have contracted the virus after his mother, a nursery school teacher, took him to her classroom on June . He spent  minutes playing on a blanket belonging to a six-year-old female pupil, who later tested positive the day before he did. The Hebei Provincial Health Commission says the little boy tested positive on June  after showing symptoms including a mild fever. Officials said the girl was among four members of the same family to test positive on June . She, along with her mum, were infected by her dad and grandmother, both of whom work as suppliers at Xinfadi market in Beijingaposs Fengtai District, reports say. This comes amid a new outbreak in Beijing, with the two-old-boy from Anxin in Chinaaposs northern province of Hebei among  new cases.  Four children aged two to  and six adults have been infected and their cases are being linked to Beijing Xinfadi Agricultural Products Wholesale Market.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I am knackered because he is chirping away all night.#She added: “I was the first thing he saw when he came out of his egg so he thinks I am his mother.“Sometimesthey get too big for their shells it can cause problems with them breaking out of their shell, so I needed to give him a hand which was a little nerve-wracking because I didn’t want anything going wrong but it was successful.“The whole hatching process took about  minutes, it was really quick.“I am going to keep him as a pet because quails don’t grow that big, maybe to the size of a blackbird, and they are quite independent.“They live for about two or three years.“I can’t believe he actually hatched – I am off work just now and not going back any time soon so this was a really productive and nice thing to do during the quarantine.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

It seems that once again Old Cove has been overlooked.“We have little or no phone signal here and now we are being denied equal access to high speed internet.”Another said: “It’s a nightmare down here with almost non-existent phone signal and relatively poor speeds on the existing overhead lines.”The affected area of Cove – which lies closest to the suburb’s picturesque harbour – also includes the popular Cove Bay Hotel.Owner of the hotel Guy Craig said: “The speed of the internet matters greatly.“At any one time, we can have upwards of  people in the building between residents, people in the public bar, people in the restaurant and the staff. Everybody uses their phones more, everybody uses tablets more, and we are using more devices in the hotel as time goes on.“A lack of access to a faster internet wouldn’t be helpful. It would hinder me giving a better experience to my customers, and it would hinder me being able to upgrade to better and faster software in the future.”Councillor Alex Nicoll, who represents Cove, said: “I’m sure there’s lots of railways lines in the country going between communities, and both sides have connectivity.“The whole idea of CityFibre was to provide the city, and to miss out parts of the city for logistical reasons is very disappointing.“All the more so, at a time when we have a pandemic going and people are really having to rely ever more to work from home and use broadband and good internet and technology connections.”Allan McEwan, CityFibre’s city manager for Aberdeen, said: “We understand that demand is higher than ever for improved digital connectivity and we are working hard to bring our full fibre network within reach of most homes and businesses in Aberdeen, a project which represents £ million of private investment by CityFibre.“There are a number of challenges linked to achieving that goal and some areas, such as parts of Cove Bay, present build complexities which require further investigation to review possible solutions and feasibility.“Although the area is not in our short term programme of works, this does not mean a decision has been made to exclude it and we would encourage residents to register their interest at www.cityfibre register to ensure they are kept up to date on any developments.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.53620479-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.53620479-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.53620479-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.53620479-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"north east health board outlines re mobilisation plan for coronavirus","story":"North-east health bosses have released details of its re-mobilisation plan to tackle Covid-.NHS Grampian was previously running Operation Rainbow, its initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.However, now that the region is thought to be past its peak in cases, the health board has moved on from this operation and begun working following its re-mobilisation plan.The current version of the plan is proposed to be updated again at the end of July.The plan aims to ensure that the stepping-up of services is safe and clinically prioritised, and that it minimises harm to patients, public,  staff and other professionals who are working across Grampian.It intends to meet this measure through the test and trace programme brought in by the Scottish Government, continuing the use of community assessment hubs, supporting care provided closer to home through Operation Home First and using Total Triage and Near Me technology where possible.A number of actions are currently being carried out across hospitals and other healthcare settings in the north-east.At Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the plan outlines the current working position, where staff will continue to care for the most acute Covid- and non-covid patients.There will be  general beds retained for covid patients, and an additional assessment ward. Twelve ICU beds will be kept for coronavirus patients, with a total capacity of  beds with extra available areas.Emergency and unscheduled care and protected services will be kept, and theatre capacity will be re-mobilised to allow patients requiring urgent and cancer surgeries to take place.Albyn Hospital is also to help with additional theatre capacity, and the health board is working with the Golden Jubilee Hospital and other areas to increase out of area capacity.Woodend Hospital will provide minor trauma surgical interventions, and will also continue to provide critical services such as stroke, neuro and ortho rehabilitations.A total of  new domestic staff have joined NHS Grampian, and  existing staff have increased their contracts to help out, with touch surface cleaning increasing in some areas to every  minutes.A statement from NHS Grampian said: #We are aware there will be many other efforts and changes being made across Grampian.#We are very proud of and would like to thank all health and social care staff who have been working tirelessly to adapt and flex to what has been required of them during this changing time.#During the months ahead we will continue to work closely together, learning from what has worked well and building on the progress and successes we have had.#We hope all staff will input to this journey, to make sure the services we provide are the best they can be for those who receive them, and those who work in them.#More technological-based services are being utilised where possible, such as mental health and learning disability services being offered via telephone or Near Me sessions for those who require ongoing contact.The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesdepartment also using Near Me technology, however most young people continue to be seen on site.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e4a1ef5569158.70183496-scaled-e1586848041250-832x564.jpg ","title":"north east steam railway hails victory after reaching funding goal","story":"A north-east steam railway has reached a major milestone after meeting its funding goal for a new bridge.The Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society plans to extend its line to run into Banchory # but a new bridge over the Burn of Bennie is needed for it to do so.Now the next stage of the project can go ahead after an application for funding was approved.Volunteers at the trust # which formed  years ago and operates steam and diesel services on part of the old Royal Deeside line # have been awarded funding from the Barrack Charitable Trust and Viridor Credit.Combined with money raised through the railway#s operations, they have raised the £, required for the bridge through the #Going West# appeal.Fergus McGhie, one of the society#s volunteers and the project lead for the Bennie bridge, said: #This is a major step for us and is the last signicant obstacle in the way of us taking the railway all the way into Banchory.#The new bridge will essentially provide a new route for walkers, cyclists and horse riders using the Deeside Way. We can#t lay track on the existing bridge # which was built in  # until we have done that.#To get the funding, we had to show evidence of signicant support from the community and we have got that. Andrew Bowie MP, Alexander Burnett MSP and Banchory Lodge, as well as many others, have all been extremely supportive and wrote letters in support of our applications for funding.#We have been so well-supported and we have a lot of people to be grateful to.#Much of the funding will be used for concrete abutments to support the new bridge, which are being construced by Aberdeen construction firm Chap.To complete the railway#s extension into Banchory, the society expects to require around £, which would pay for track and ballast.Volunteers were congratulated on the success of the appeal in a letter from West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Mr Bowie.He wrote: “I wish to congratulate you all at the Royal Deeside Railway Preservation Society on the success of your #Going West# appeal. I am pleased to hear that you will now be able to complete the construction of the new Bridge of Bennie.“This will bring you one step closer to achieving your goal of extending the Royal Deeside Railway all the way to Banchory.“It is always good to hear of the real dference that passionate and committed groups, like yourselves, can make for the benefit of their local community.“I wish you all the very best of luck and I look forward to seeing the finished product.”The society hopes to open the new bridge later this year.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 8 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsJock Munro posted: #I fail to see how two men in the front seat of a minibus or van can stay two metres apart.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school. The extra transmission risk from a deep-cleaned environment like a school must surely be negligible. The risks of not going to school ndash mental health, obesity, domestic abuse and the like ndash are almost certainly greater than the risk of Covid.:Coronavirus: Push to prescribe vitamin D to people at highest risk from Covid in bid to curb second wave of virusParents say, rightly, that the two metre rule is not enforced in hospitals. It manestly isnrsquot in supermarkets, parks and public transport either. So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed. He would be proud to see the nationrsquos youth gathering around their screens.

It seems invidious to talk of them as a universally frail category perhaps they are better described as having reached a point when there is much less road ahead than in the rear view mirror. Yet, regardless of physical condition, by this stage spiritual sustenance and solace become more pressing and meaningful. Equally comforting is the companionship and consolation of a like-minded community.Brought up as I was in a devout Church of Scotland family, I saw the importance for older members of the routine, ritual and contact weekly services offered. Remembering some of our church-going friends, people of inspiring kindness and integrity, it is deeply upsetting to think that it is iniduals like them, to whom the church owes its very existence, who are being sidelined and devalued. The idea of banishing the elderly, of consigning them to a Zoom link or a virtual coffee morning until the virus has fled, is cruel. Therersquos no other word for it.

For months, the -plus have been living in near isolation and confinement, bombarded with terrying news and statistics, and unable to see family or friends. Imprisoned as they have been at home, for them the church represents a calm, still centre during the storm. Many will have been longing to get back into their place of worship, but will now be worried they are not entirely welcome. It doesnrsquot get much more hurtful than that.As well as being harsh, the Kirkrsquos attitude is also short-sighted. Dwindling as its resources are, it relies heavily on bequests. For some parishioners, as they approach old age it is important to know they will continue to contribute to the Church of Scotlandrsquos work, long after they have gone. Their legacies are priceless, not to say essential, but they should not be taken for granted.

Of course nobody should fall ill because of attending a Sunday service, butsafety procedures are followed, it will be no more dangerous ndash arguably less so ndash than any other venture or visit.In showing such caution and cowardice, the Kirk has forgotten the principles on which it was founded: it is a Christian duty to tend the sick, befriend the lonely, and to nurture every believerrsquos spirit. This latest salvo smacks more of health and safety or fear of litigation than le-giving care and compassion.

So we want to make these things easier.ldquoNow the really important thing Irsquove got to stress is wersquove got to still be very careful, because although numbers of cases of the virus and thankfully numbers of people dying or getting very ill with it are declining quite rapidly, it hasnrsquot gone away. Itrsquos still out there.ldquoWe see in other countries right now ndash China is dealing with a new outbreak, some parts of America are seeing cases going up again.ldquoSo itrsquos still a big danger and that means wersquove still got to be careful and take things step by step, which actually it gets harder for me to persuade people of that the more we see levels of the infection reduce, but actually it continues to be really important that we donrsquot get reckless and take too many steps too quickly that then allows it to spread again.During the Capital Scotland radio show Ms Sturgeon was also asked how she looks after her own mental and emotional wellbeing.She said: ldquoItrsquos been dficult I guess over the last wee while because I have been so busy trying to deal with this day by day but Irsquove got a great husband at home who, you know, helps to look after me and make sure Irsquom not getting too stressed out about things.ldquoAnd I suppose, every now and again, Irsquove just tried to take a step back and try to focus on the positives, which during a time like this is not easy to do but there have been positives out of this.ldquoI think the sense of collective and community spirit that we found over the past three months has been really inspiring.ldquoWersquove all done the right thing not just for ourselves but for each other and I hope as we come out of the crisis and get back to normal, we donrsquot lose all of that, that we actually remember that, you know, whether itrsquos enjoying spending a bit more time with immediate family in your own household, or just getting off the treadmill a little bit for some people, that we just remember what really matters in le.

Three years ago teachers were awarded a three-year pay deal, which gave them. per cent each year for three years, not \"a  per cent pay hike\" last year, and this after some years of pay freeze.Ruth Mackay, Kelso.Read More: Letters: Seeds of ision were sown long before the rise of the SNPI AM disappointed with the lack of clarity from the Education Secretary around the reopening of schools and the failure to ensure the young people are given the opportunity toto school with confidence.One of the suggestions is that some pupils attend on Monday and Tuesday with the other half attending on Thursday and Friday to permit deep cleans on Wednesday.Why would we waste the valuable resource of a full day Wednesday for cleaning  I am not denying cleaning is essential to reduce risk of virus transmission, but why can this not be carried out with a back sht after the teaching day ends The young people are the future and decisions cannot be left to inidual schools but must be a priority of the Government at this anxious time. Whether there is a financial cost or not, it should in no way be a barrier to making the best use of the schools and resources available to provide dedicated direct teaching time.Alison Tait, Ayr."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amOrkney Islands Council#s recycling centres at Hatston and Garson will be accepting heavy corrugated cardboard # as well as garden waste # from Tuesday, June .

Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent.

We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing. To ensure we have cleared the backlog, we intend to continue with the four-week cycle again.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day – but remember to do this weekly. You should remove the caddies inside # and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as we will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis – again on your usual collection day.This means that the council will collect:• Glass # week commencing June .• Plastic # bottles week commencing June .• Metals and tins # week commencing July .• Paper card # week commencing July .Councillor Drever added: “We want to thank households for their cooperation and patience whilst we continue to clear the backlog of recyclables that folk have been storing during the pandemic.”Just a reminder that paper and card is being collected this week . This should be contained in a single green bin or box. Corrugated cardboard should not be included – either in the bin or left alongside.It is hoped that corrugated cardboard can be accepted from next week at the recycling centres at Hatston and Garson, along with garden waste.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

Sinn Fein spent £, during this period, with the Conservatives spending the second highest amount locally with £,.The Alliance Party spent £,, SDLP £, and the DUP spent considerably less than their political rivals Sinn Fein, with only £, spent.Aontu spent £, People Before Profit Alliance spent £ and the Green Party spent just £ during this period.The DUP suffered a bruising general election, losing two MPs in Nigel Doddsand Emma Little-Pengelly . Mr Dodds lost his seat to Sinn Fein#s John Finucane while Little-Pengelly was defeated by the SDLP#s Claire Hanna. The general election saw Nationalist MPs outnumber unionists at Westminster for the first time. The DUP took eight seats, with Sinn Fein taking seven, the SDLP two and the Alliance Party one. Cahir Hughes, Head of Electoral Commission Northern Ireland, said: “This is the first publication of spending information relating to last year’s general election, an important part of the transparency which is essential to our democratic process. It is vital that voters are able to see clearly and accurately how money is spent on influencing them at elections.“For future elections, we have recommended that the law be changed so that parties and campaigners have to provide voters with more detail about how they spend their money at elections. This sits alongside other recommended changes to improve transparency and to address public concerns about who has produced and paid for the political campaign material they see online.”Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Obviously many people will be nervous, butyou can spend, do - it might save a job or two. Most of Northern Ireland#s often-criticised large public sector still have employment, as do others in IT, agriculture, etc, he said.So the advice is not to be reckless, but economies only grow and jobs are saved by spending. Soyou can, do. Maybe then we can keep less people on furlough from ending up unemployed.Speaking at an online seminar of the Association of Chartered Certied Accountants, Mr Gibson said: It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most. This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.He told the Belfastthat the public understandably felt powerless in the face of large-scale redundancies, including , jobs lost between aeroplane seat maker Thompson Aero and aerospace giant Bombardier. But he added: We can#t go out and buy aeroplane seats or wings, but what we can do is make those little decisions to support those restaurants, shops and cafes that might close without our support.The money you hand over to that person on the other side of the till could make the dference to whether or not that person still has that job in the future.He added putting up with queues in order to support businesses was the right thing to do. Maybe you look at the coffee shop or ice-cream shop and think you can#t be bothered queuing, he said. But that decision could be a dference between that coffee shop staying open or not. It sounds dramatic, but it#s true.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA.” “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. googletag.cmd.push SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added:“This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, googletag.cmd.push Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”  CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A new m footway and cycleway has been constructed between the Ford Road junction on Mayogall Road in Clady. The project, along with m of resurfacing work, marks the completion of the project at an estimated cost of pound,. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake congratulated DFI Roads Service on the completion of the project. He said: “The newly created footway will make it much safer for all road and footway users including school children attending the local schools, pedestrians and motorists alike. googletag.cmd.push “With the popularity of cycling ever increasing the widening of the footway to include cycle-paths are a much-welcomed addition. “The junction of the Ford Road has been greatly improved with the removal of high verges at the entrance greatly improving visibility for those entering and exiting this junction. “I wish to thank Tracy Bratton DFI Roads Service and FP Mc Cann contractors for their cooperation in having this signicant road safety project delivered. The residents of Clady and surrounding area are very appreciative of these improvements, completed to a high standard that improves safety for motorists, walkers and cyclists alike.” Work has also been completed in the nearby area of Glenone, with safety chevrons restored on the Portglenone to Bellaghy Road. googletag.cmd.push Carntogher councillor Martin Kearney welcomed the development but condemned vandalism to road signage in the area. “A number of traffic accidents here in recent times have caused considerable concern to local road users,” he said. “Previous markers had been demolished as well with vehicles often ending up in the nearby fields. I am pleased to report the Department of Infrastructure has replaced these chevrons. “However, it is disappointing to note that when the local community were abiding by the advice to lockdown others were vandalising the nearby Ballynease Rd bilingual sign which has been there for over  years. Thankfully the Council have replaced that also.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This programme celebrates everyone, from our young children to our students, and the adults out there as well – its never too late to learn! Our current situation can be overwhelming and frustrating at times, and this festival offers the perfect solution, by picking up new skills and information, and by utilising technology in a way that we may never have needed before.” More details about the festival are available on the councils website.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

in Craigavon.The £ million development has been known as South Lake LeisureCentre but DUP party group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter feels this proposal is a fitting way to honour both the jewel in the council’s crown and the centenaryof Northern Ireland.“Our country celebrates a great milestone on the May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom,” said Cllr Baxter.“Given the current economic situation, as a party we have discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary.“At Council’s next monthly meeting we will propose that Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon at the south lake as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.“No official name had ever been discussed until this week so we feel it’s very timely.“This is an iconic building within our borough and indeed will be the most modern centre within Northern Ireland, we all look forward to the grand opening which will be a very welcome investment to the area.”The centre had been due to open in August of this year but this has been delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
