Say you can\u0027t help them and give them the number of the Foreign Ministry.\u0027His comments, first reported in Israeli media, were confirmed by officials who attended the meeting.They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed Cabinet proceedings.Israel, one of the few countries that has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine, may be able to insulate itself from the international pressure as long as it continues to mediate between the warring sides.Joining the sanctions would risk drawing Russian ire and jeopardize Israel\u0027s unique role.Ksenia Svetlova, an international-affairs expert and former Israeli lawmaker born in Russia, said Israel would hold out from taking a stance as long as possible.\u0027It depends on what kind of pressure they will exercise against Israel,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not voluntarily, certainly.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Fourth Covid jabs rolled WEEK amid rising admissions cases","story":"Share this article The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended fourth doses to the most vulnerable age groups this spring, telling ministers they should be dished out around six months after their last vaccine. A wider booster programme is due this autumn.  JCVI advisers originally recommended third doses on September 14, with over-75s, care home residents and patients with serious underlying health conditions first in the queue. While BA.2 is not thought to have evolved to be more severe, scientists say it has rapidly outstripped the original Omicron because it is the significantly more infectious. Professor Adrian Esterman, a leading epidemiologist in Australia and former WHO official, claimed the subvariant has a basic reproduction number (R0) of around 12, meaning if left to spread unchecked every infected person would pass it to a dozen others. It would make the sub-strain five times more infectious than the original Wuhan virus and one of the most contagious diseases known to science.  Explaining his methodology, Professor Esterman said: \u0027The basic reproduction number (R0) for BA.1 is about 8.2, making R0 for BA.2 about 12. \u0027This makes it pretty close to measles, the most contagious disease we know about.\u0027 The R0 number is the average number of people each BA.2 patient would infect, if there was no immunity in a population or behavioural changes. But most scientists say there is no reason to be concerned over the variant because it is just as mild as the original Omicron.In Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon has opted to keep compulsory face masks until April, officials are predicting that the BA.2 outbreak could peak in the next couple of weeks.Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, of the University of Edinburgh, said keeping the requirement for face coverings is in line with dealing with the surge and is a \u0027relatively easily-achieved measure\u0027.Masks on public transport, restaurants and other indoor settings were slated to be downgraded from a legal requirement to advice on March 21. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that with the \u0027current spike\u0027 in cases, ministers had agreed it was \u0027prudent\u0027 for this measure to remain in place and the legal requirement will be reviewed again in two weeks\u0027 time.  Asked whether it was prudent to keep the requirement for face coverings, Dr Tait Burkard told BBC Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland programme: \u0027It is indeed kind of line with what we are seeing with the new sub-variant of Omicron which is a very big spike in cases, in fact we have the most cases in the population at this point than ever before in the pandemic.\u0027It\u0027s also realistic to look at this from about a two-week perspective because what we are seeing in the numbers is that we could probably peak this week or the week thereafter in terms of cases, and we would actually see an easing and a clear indication before lifting face masks, and that\u0027s kind of our last barrier to go, and also our last reminder to go.\u0027And at the same time it is a relatively easily-achieved measure that has less impact on the economy. Whilst it might deter some people from going out, it might incentivise others for going out. I think there\u0027s a difficult balance to take there.\u0027There were 1,996 people in Scottish hospitals on Monday with recently confirmed Covid, up 191 on the previous day, with 33 in intensive care, up six.That is higher than the Omicron peak of 1,571 which was recorded in January this year, with more patients in hospital than at any time since January 27 last year when the total was 2,016.Dr Tait Burkard, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh\u0027s Roslin Institute and an expert on coronaviruses, said that while masks help reduce virus levels in public places, they are less effective against Omicron and BA.2.She suggested that vulnerable people should be advised to upgrade their masks to FFP2 or N95 masks for more protection.The academic said: \u0027The impacts that the mask wearing makes without many of the other restrictions in place is small, or it\u0027s smaller than it ever was before.\u0027One (reason) is that unfortunately with Omicron the kind of less protective masks, the simple surgical masks, the thin ones that you just ring round your ears, the fabric ones, they\u0027re not as protective as they were against the previous variants, just because we need to inhale less of the virus to get infected, so both time of exposure needed to get infected is less, but they still help reducing virus level in public places, and especially for vulnerable people that can make the difference.\u0027But there should be also the advice that for vulnerable people it might be a good moment, or probably a very pertinent moment, to upgrade masks to so-called FFP2 or N95 masks, the thicker ones that fit very closely around your face to protect yourself more than others.\u0027Fourth round of Covid vaccinations could start next week after slow rollout criticised"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris kicks visit Saudi Arabia Abu Dhabi","story":"Share this article   Prince Mohammed bin Salman has largely been shunned by the West after US intelligence alleged he ordered the murder of Mr Khashoggi at the kingdom\u0027s consulate in Istanbul, something the Saudi ruler denies.One person who did embrace him, however, was the Russian president, with the prince and Mr Putin sharing a high-five and a laugh at a G20 summit in the month after Mr Khashoggi\u0027s death.Mr Johnson, who will be deputised at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions on Wednesday by Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, has argued he needs to \u0027build the widest possible coalition\u0027 to address Mr Putin\u0027s attack on Ukraine.The Prime Minister is expected to discuss the importance of allies increasing the diplomatic and economic pressure on the Kremlin while mitigating the global fallout from the war.Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs Parliament\u0027s Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Government to ensure that \u0027in seeking to lessen our dependence upon one source of oil and gas, we do not end up creating a source dependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime\u0027.Mr Johnson, who travelled overnight before starting the trip in the UAE on Wednesday morning, is being joined by investment minister Lord Grimstone."},{"url":null,"title":"People avoiding driving work taking kids school soaring fuel prices","story":"Share this articleOil theft on the rise in rural areas as energy costs soar"},{"url":null,"title":"Liz Truss suggests Chelseas Roman Abramovich Putin cronies NEVER welcome UK","story":"Share this article She said the UK was working with allies \u0027in the G7 and beyond\u0027 to ensure oligarchs have \u0027nowhere where it is legitimate for them to live their lifestyles, have their yachts or have their planes\u0027.Last night it was reported that ownership of an investment company linked to Mr Abramovich was transferred to one of the 55-year-old billionaire\u0027s closest allies the day that Russia invaded Ukraine.The Wall Street Journal said that Norma Investments Ltd -

File photograph: The Professor Philip Nolan has played down a rise in Covid cases, saying it may be part of an “exit wave”. The former head of National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) modelling told reporters in Washington there were no plans to bring the group together to discuss the spike. Earlier Taoiseach Micheal Martin said the Government is “concerned” about the increase in cases of Covid-19, but said there were no new measures currently being considered by the Government.“We are concerned with the increase in Covid cases,” Mr Martin told reporters in Washington DC. But he said that the “advice so far is that the impact in terms of illness is not severe”. He urged people to get the booster dose of the Covid vaccine. Mr Martin said that about 50 per cent of cases were being admitted to hospital for other reasons, but were testing positive for Covid subsequently.However, Mr Martin said that ICU numbers were not rising at the moment. “We’ve been in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer and the Minister for Health on this and we’ll keep it under watching review.”He said people should wear masks “where appropriate”, citing retail and public transport as well as “large indoor gatherings”. He said that people should “enjoy St Patricks Day” but they should “take basic precautions”.Emergency departmentsIn a briefing on Wednesday the Health Service Executive (HSE) said more than 4,000 healthcare workers are off work due to Covid as hospitals experience unprecedented demand from emergency patients.The numbers attending hospital emergency departments (EDs) have been at near-record levels for the past three weeks, the HSE said .Attendances at EDs last week were the second highest on record, just behind the figures for the previous week, and over 28,000 both weeks, officials told a media briefing.The increase is driven by increased attendance by older people, up one-quarter on the same week in 2020 and 2021. Only half of over-75s are being dealt with in EDs within the target time of nine hours.Hospitals in Galway and Kilkenny, along with St Vincents and the Mater in Dublin, are under the heaviest pressure, officials said, but smaller hospitals such as Bantry and South Tipperary are also very busy.HSE chief executive Paul Reid urged people to “get back to basics” around public health measures over the St Patrick’s Day holiday, and pointed out that mask-wearing is still recommended “in the appropriate settings”.He likened the coming bank holidays to a “double weekend” in terms of pressure on the health service, but officials said they were supportive of the Government decision to make this Friday a bank holiday in recognition of the efforts of workers during the pandemic.Covid-19 patient numbers in hospital have risen 32 per cent in a week and 72 per cent in the last two weeks, according to the HSE.Mr Reid said the 1,082 patients with Covid-19 in hospital on Wednesday - the highest figure in over a year - were impacting heavily on the hospital system.However, the level of sickness doctors are seeing is not as high as before and of those in hospital with the virus, 48 per cent came in with other illnesses and were later diagnosed with Covid-19, he pointed out.He urged people to get vaccinated or boosted if they haven’t already done so, to stay at home if they have symptoms and to wear a mask where advised.The high circulation of Covid-19 has also been felt in nursing homes, where 300 have outbreaks and 96 new outbreaks were notified in the last week.The proportion of over-65s among those in hospital has risen to 73 per cent, from 51 per cent previously.Un- or under-vaccinated people are still disproportionately represented in hospital, where 35 per cent of patients with Covid-19 have not completed a vaccination course, and in ICU, where the figure is 37 per cent.Of the estimated 566 patients who are currently in hospital because of Covid-19, only 44 per cent have received a booster.The BA.2 subvariant of Omicron accounts for 90 per cent of cases at present, up from 70 per cent in late February, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said.There was evidence of re-infection among people who previously had the Delta variant and, to a lesser extent, OmicronBA.1 cases, he said.Officials said 4,102 healthcare staff are currently off work due to Covid-19 and 540 are off work in nursing homes.Asked whether people should wear a mask over the St Patrick’s Day festivities in light of the increase levels of infection, Dr Henry advised that people should exercise their own judgement but that “the wiser thing might be to wear one” in congested settings.As for what will happen over the coming while, Dr Henry said there was a “great deal of uncertainty”.PressureThe Mater hospital in Dublin appealed to the public on Wednesday to aboid its emergency department due to the “extreme pressure” on services.The hospital says the pressure is the result of large numbers contracting Covid-19, high presentations at the emergency department and high levels of staff absence due to the virus.Non-urgent patients who are attending the emergency department are experiencing lengthy waiting times.Public health officials have expressed concern over the rise in case numbers and hospitalisation, but have so far held back from calling for a re-introduction of mask mandates or other restrictions.Meanwhile, a total of 183 outbreaks were notified last week, up 55 on the previous week, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.The biggest increase was in residential institutions, with 55 outbreaks last week compared to 34 the week before. Most of these - 35 - were in centres for disabilities.OutbreaksThere were 30 outbreaks in hospitals, up two, and 45 in nursing homes, up eight. The biggest hospital outbreak involved 13 case and the biggest in a nursing home, 24.All 15 school outbreaks notified last week occurred in special education.There were 10 outbreaks in the Traveller community, and three among prisoners and prison staff, one of which involved 23 cases.The HPSC said 24 Covid-19 were notified to it last week, with an average age of 82 years.Cases are now rising across Europe and, in some, hospital numbers are also increasing.In China, case numbers have reached a two-year high and millions of people have been locked down as the country struggles to contain Omicron variant outbreaks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"scrutiny tightens on coalition as public set for more energy price hikes","story":"Price hikes will doubtlessly bring more scrutiny on carbon tax increases due in May – and while the Green Party will not tolerate any deviation from that path, it may emerge as a bone of contention at budget time.

It noted that Class A drugs were found on the site at the time.“On their last day of school, 81 Year 13 students left their inidual boarding houses at 2.30am,” the report said. “Having disabled locks and alarms, they took a pre-planned route, carefully avoiding CCTV cameras, to an agreed destination.“These unsupervised students consumed alcohol that had been brought on to site in secret. One student was found unconscious and alone in an orchard. Another student was hospitalised because of excess alcohol consumption.”Inspectors noted that the school’s staff were “alert to the possibility” of end-of-term celebrations, but were “not sufficiently vigilant” in preventing them from going ahead.Teachers told Ofsted that students were frustrated that they were not allowed to have a graduation party because of Covid restrictions.“Since this incident, leaders have started to use sniffer dogs and thermal imaging cameras to prevent any recurrences,” inspectors said.It was one in a series of incidents which led to the school being branded “inadequate” for safeguarding by Ofsted. Although it was marked as “good” in all other areas, the safeguarding rating means that the school has failed independent school standards and has been ordered to submit an action plan to the Department for Education by the end of the month.The boarding school, which is known as the “Catholic Eton”, is based within the grounds of Ampleforth Abbey. The main school building adjoins the abbey.Inspectors also expressed concern that an earlier agreement which gave the headmaster a veto over which monks could reside in the abbey was no longer in place.“This means that there is now little that leaders can do if the abbot decides to admit monks of concern onto the Ampleforth Abbey site,” the report said.“Monks of concern would include those who have been accused, and any found guilty of, child sexual abuse in the past and any who are under investigation currently.”The inspectors said that an “information-sharing protocol” was being negotiated between the school and the abbey. It states that safeguarding information should be shared between the abbey and the school “but it does not include a headteacher’s veto”, Ofsted said.The Ofsted report noted that parents are “overwhelmingly positive” about the school and that pupils “achieve well” academically.A spokesman for Ampleforth College said it was “deeply disappointed” by the report, which it believes contains “substantive factual inaccuracies” about its safeguarding arrangements.It said the school leavers’ party was reported to the authorities the same day and that it “immediately undertook an exercise to learn lessons”.The spokesman said it is “simply incorrect” that a student was missing for an hour and was unconscious in an orchard. The spokesman also said there was “no evidence” that the Class A drugs were actually consumed.The school said that students were disciplined “in a manner which reflected the seriousness of the incident”, adding that they implemented additional security measures afterwards.The spokesman added that the school and abbey are separate institutions, with the separation “monitored and controlled by CCTV, fences, risk assessments, a robust visitor policy and security personnel”. All monks have enhanced DBS clearance.A Department for Education spokesman said: “The best interests of Ampleforth’s pupils and school community have consistently been at the heart of decision-making.“Despite some improvement, the school has not delivered its commitment to meeting the independent school standards in full – as is required of independent schools at all times.“We have asked the school to prepare a new action plan by the end of March. We will consider whether any further enforcement action may be necessary in light of the school’s new plan.”More from News\u0026#39Is that Mummy?\u0026#39 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally reunited with family on British soilNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker arrives back in UK after six-year ordeal‘Mummy really is coming home’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to her family after £393m deal with IranPaul Pogba’s house burgled while he was playing for Manchester United against Atletico MadridMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dodo could brought back extinction successful genome sequence","story":"The entire genome of the dodo has been sequenced for the first time, raising hopes that the bird could be brought back from extinction. Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar that her group would soon publish the complete DNA of a specimen in the Natural History Museum of Copenhagen.The flightless 3ft-tall bird was wiped out in the 17th-century, just 100 years after it was discovered on the island of Mauritius.Not only was it hunted by humans, it also became prey for the dogs, cats and pigs brought with the sailors as they explored the islands of the Indian Ocean.Asked whether the dodo genome had been completely sequenced, Prof Shapiro said: “Yes, the dodo genome is entirely sequenced because we sequenced it. It’s not been published yet, but it does exist and we’re working on it right now.”“I tried for a long time to get DNA from a specimen that’s in Oxford. We got a tiny little bit of DNA…but that particular sample didn’t have sufficiently well-preserved DNA.”She said that the team had now found “fantastic specimen” in Denmark.“So we have a very high quality, high coverage, dodo genome which will soon be published,” she added, but warned that it still could be tricky to bring back the bird.“Mammals are simpler,” she said. “If I have a cell and it’s living in a dish in the lab and I edit it so that it has a bit of Dodo DNA, how do I then transform that cell into a whole living, breathing, actual animal?“The way we can do this is to clone it, the same approach that was used to create Dolly the Sheep, but we don\u0027t know how to do that with birds because of the intricacies of their reproductive pathways.“So there needs to be another approach for birds and this is one really fundamental technological hurdle in de-extinction. There are groups working on different approaches for doing that and I have little doubt that we are going to get there but it is an additional hurdle for birds that we don’t have for mammals.”The dodo takes its name from the Portuguese word for fool after sailors mocked it for its apparent lack of fear of armed hunters.It is closely related genetically to the Nicobar pigeon, and it is likely scientists would edit pigeon DNA to include Dodo DNA if they wanted to bring back the species.Mike Benton, Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Bristol, said it would be preferable to bring back a dodo, rather than an animal from further back in time, because it could survive in today’s environment.However, he said it may not completely resemble the extinct bird.“The dodo is a popular bird and it’s one you can make a case for bringing back,” he said. “If you bring T-Rex back to life maybe that wouldn\u0027t be the popular thing as it would run riot and cause havoc.“But bringing back something that wasn’t so ancient would be much more feasible. The dodo has a known habitat that is readily available.“In terms of engineering the dodo, you would face all the problems that people have faced and the reality of generating of a whole new species, whether you could inject parts of that dodo DNA into a modern pigeon and somehow generate a dodo, it would probably not look anything quite like what we would expect a dodo to look like.”World-renowned geneticist Prof George Church and his team at Harvard University have been working for the past two years on recreating the DNA blueprint of the mammoth.He also said it was easier to engineer a mammal than to bring back a bird like the dodo.“Probably the easiest thing right now is to engineer a mammal,” he said. “But even if you can just bring some of the DNA back, those genes can be used in a whole variety of ways, for example restoring ersity to a species.“It means we are not limited to the last herd, we can go all over the world and backward in time and get ersity, and reach for inidual parts of the plants of animals.”More from News\u0026#39Is that Mummy?\u0026#39 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally reunited with family on British soilAs it happened: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrives back in UK after six-year ordeal‘Mummy really is coming home’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to her family after £393m deal with IranPaul Pogba’s house burgled while he was playing for Manchester United against Atletico MadridMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"had extraordinary generosity house refugee","story":"We do have a spare room, but it’s tiny.

The risk of connective tissue diseases was increased by 15 per cent, IBS by 20 per cent and rheumatoid arthritis by around 40 per cent.The team defined high pollution as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 above 20 micrograms per m3) or larger particles (PM10 above 30 micrograms per m3) - the equivalent of a busy inner-city road in Britain.PM2.5 pollution comes primarily from vehicle exhausts, power plants factories and burning wood, while PM10 is larger particles, which can come from smoke, dust and dirt from construction.“Iniduals chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution might be at risk of developing autoimmune diseases,” the authors concluded in the study published in the British Medical Journal.“The biological rationale supporting our results is strong.”Information on air quality was obtained from 617 monitoring stations in 110 Italian provinces. Medical records showed around 12 per cent of people had an autoimmune condition in the study. Around six per cent of people in Britain suffer from autoimmunity.The average long-term exposure between 2013 and 2019 was found to be 16 micrograms per m3 for PM2.5 and 25 micrograms per m3 for PM10.Although the study is observational, and the link cannot be proven, it is thought that emissions can cause the immune system to misfire, prompting inflammation through the body, tissue damage and eventually an autoimmune disease, where the body attacks itself.Air pollution has already been linked to immune system abnormalities, while smoking, which shares some toxins with fossil fuel emissions, doubles the risk of rheumatoid arthritis.Pollution has also been linked to other conditions including sight loss, dementia, depression, lung disease and heart problems.Commenting on the research, Prof Felicity Gavins, the director of The Centre for Inflammation Research and Translational Medicine, at Brunel University London, said: “This study further supports the mounting evidence suggesting a link between air pollution exposure and autoimmune diseases.“We know that autoimmune diseases are characterised by uncontrolled activation and dysregulation of the immune system.“Whether air pollution exposure specifically causes autoimmune diseases remains controversial, although there is no doubt that there is a link.”More from News\u0026#39Is that Mummy?\u0026#39 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally reunited with family on British soilNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker arrives back in UK after six-year ordeal‘Mummy really is coming home’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to her family after £393m deal with IranPaul Pogba’s house burgled while he was playing for Manchester United against Atletico MadridMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mummy really coming home nazanin zaghari ratcliffe returns family","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returned to the UK overnight after the Government paid off a debt of almost £400 million, in a move that paves the way for a nuclear deal with Iran.As the six-year detention of the British-Iranian national finally came to an end, Gabriella, her seven-year-old daughter, was told: “This time mummy really is coming home.”The 43-year-old and Anoosheh Ashoori, a fellow dual-national detainee, were allowed to leave Tehran as soon as the Ministry of Defence handed over cash for a tanks deal dating back to 1979.Those involved in the negotiations said the deal was agreed because both sides believed it would “smooth nuclear negotiations between the West and Iran”.A nuclear deal would result in the lifting of sanctions, which will allow Iranian oil back on the global market amid the energy crisis caused by sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.The Government-chartered aircraft carrying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire just after 1am.Just after they touched down on British soil, Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, said she was delighted they were home.She tweeted: Delighted that Nazanin and Anoosheh have landed safely in the UK and are reunited with their families and loved ones.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release came on the same day Boris Johnson travelled to the Middle East in an attempt to secure new oil production deals.On Wednesday, Iran’s foreign minister said a nuclear deal that would allow the UK to buy Iranian oil was “very close”, at the same time as MPs and families of the British-Iranian detainees celebrated their imminent return.Tulip Siddiq, MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, paid tribute to Richard Ratcliffe’s “relentless campaigning” for the release of his wife. Turning to the Commons public gallery, where Mr Ratcliffe and Gabriella were watching the debate, his constituency MP added: “Can I say to Gabriella, this time Mummy really is coming home.”After the plane carrying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was on its way to the UK, her husband said: “The first thing she wanted was for me to make her a cup of tea.” He also said he would tidy the house ready for her arrival.Gabriella, who was with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe when she was arrested in 2016 and spent three years living with her grandparents in Tehran, told The  that the first thing that she wanted to do with her mother was to “go to the toy shop”.Mr Ratcliffe said that their daughter, who can now play the piano, was looking forward to “showing her Mummy the things she can do now that she couldn’t before”.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori, a 68-year-old from Lewisham, south-east London, who was detained after being accused of spying for Israel in 2017, landed at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning.When asked what he would say to his wife, Mr Ratcliffe said: “Hello! I remember the first time I spoke to her when she was first taken ... and I said the only thing that matters, and that’s ‘I miss you, and I love you’.“Probably at this point I’ll say ‘welcome home’ and ‘we’ll be OK’ because she has the fear, you know, what it’s like to come back and to adjust.”Speaking during a visit to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the Prime Minister said he was “thrilled” that the Ratcliffe family would be reunited, adding: “I am glad that after a great deal of UK diplomacy we have been able to get her out, get her back to her family.”The Government paid £393.8 million before the dual national citizens could leave Iran.The money has been ringfenced for humanitarian purposes in order to circumvent the sanctions in force against the Iranian regime.Ms Truss said Oman had been “instrumental” in brokering the release. She was keen to separate the payment of the “legitimate debt” with the release of the prisoners, but sources confirmed that the plane could only take off once the transaction had been made.A senior Omani figure, who asked to remain anonymous, said the UK paid the money it owed Iran to Oman’s central bank because “Iran put it as a condition” of the release.“Iran has agreed to release the two prisoners because they believe it will lead to the successful conclusion of the nuclear talks that will lift sanctions against them,” he said. “Both Oman and the UK believe that their release will help to ensure smooth nuclear negotiations between the West and Iran.”The Government has insisted that the release was linked to talks to revive the 2015 deal in which Iran agreed not to pursue nuclear weapons in return for which sanctions would be lifted.Iranian officials have also tried to separate the issues, but have signalled that on the side-lines of the nuclear talks in Vienna they have also been discussing a possible prisoner exchange with the US.Whitehall sources said that urgency in the talks were connected to the situation in Ukraine and Ms Truss told the Commons that now “two of the major issues facing the UK and Iran had been resolved, officials are “currently working on” the nuclear deal.It came as Mr Johnson appeared not to win any oil commitments from Saudi Arabia. The Prime Minister was unable to go further than saying that there was “an interest for Saudi Arabia, for all oil-producing and exporting countries, in making sure that the global economy is not damaged by the current spikes”.In the midst of the celebrations, Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, who had failed to secure the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe during his time in office, admitted that the Government “took too long” to get her home.Saying that he was “pinching himself” over the news, Mr Hunt told LBC: “I don’t think Nazanin will be home today if it wasn’t for her husband, Richard, and Richard did one incredible thing as a human being.“The Foreign Office told him to keep quiet about this and he ignored that advice. They said it would be easier to negotiate privately with the Iranians.“He said: ‘No, I want the world to know about Nazanin.’ And in doing that, what he did was he told the world about hostage-taking and what that means is that now Nazanin is coming home, and Anoosheh.”   After landing back home, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori smiled and chatted as they walked from the aircraft into a reception building at the RAF Brize Norton airport.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe waved to the cameras, while Mr Ashoori, who was carrying a magazine, gave a salute.Mr Ashoori appeared to be taking photos with the pilots in the cockpit on the plane, as they waited to disembark.He could be seen posing with two men through the windows of the cockpit.Mr Ashoori made a peace sign to journalists as the pair walked side by side from the runway to a building at the air force base in Oxfordshire.Ms Truss, who was understood to be at the RAF base to welcome them both home, took time to tweet about a third British detainee, Morad Tahbaz, who has been released from prison on furlough but remains in Iran:Mr Ratcliffe and Gabriella were waiting at RAF Brize Norton for the Government-chartered flight, and were due to enjoy their family reunion in private.Looking forward to a new life, said Mr Ratcliffe.You can\u0027t get back the time that\u0027s gone.

In a world that is being torn apart by the bloody and senseless conflict in Ukraine, came word that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on her way home to the UK, along with another, less well-known, British-Iranian former prisoner, Anoosheh Ashoori. It was only a few days ago that Nazanin emailed me to say that she was weary and longing to be with her husband and daughter after spending six years detained in Iran. For the past year she and I have been able to talk via the internet as I attempted to encourage her to keep hope alive. I recollect my last words to her, spoken just a few days ago: “Be assured Nazanin, this ordeal will come to an end.” When I heard that she was at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport my thoughts went back to the time I was at that same airport bringing home several hostages. We passed through all the checks and were about to board when suddenly an official appeared and told us we could not leave. Thankfully, three days later, we were on the flight home, but I hoped and prayed that Nazanin would not suffer the same experience. It was six years ago that I first met her husband Richard, who suddenly found himself thrown into the midst of a major international dispute, after Nazanin was arrested at that same airport. It is difficult for anyone who has not had this experience to appreciate how hard this can be. Apart from the demanding task of caring for their young daughter, at first from afar (until 2019, Gabriella, who had been with her mother when she was arrested, lived with her maternal grandparents in Iran) and then at home, alone, he was faced with hard decisions. The reasons for Nazanin’s detention were not immediately clear. Should he remain silent and allow negotiations to take place through diplomatic channels or should he go public? Initially he kept in the background until finally he could contain himself no longer and began a public campaign for her release. At long last that campaign is now over.In front of television cameras today, Richard said the first thing Nazanin would be looking forward to would be a cup of tea – and that he had better tidy the house. My first night of freedom was spent at a military hospital in Cyprus. I was alone and did not sleep a wink my mind was racing and I had little idea of what I was about to face. For Nazanin to return to so-called ‘normal’ life after spending so many agonising years in captivity will be both joyful and difficult. I remember when I came home in 1991 after spending five years as a hostage in the Middle East. When I was captured, my son was a young teenager when I returned he was a young man and I hardly recognised him.Since those days communications have advanced and Nazanin has been able to see and speak with her daughter online. But even this is a mixed blessing, as the pain of separation can be made more acute by not being able to have actual face to face contact. One of the sound pieces of advice I was given when I was released was to take the experience of release as though I was coming up from the seabed – if you come up too quickly you will get the bends, which will kill you. If you take it gently it will be OK. It is not easy to follow this advice when one is subject to pressure from the media and for a period one becomes a major source of attraction. My advice to anyone who faces such an experience is to make one statement for all the media and then retire for a while. Many journalists have an appreciation for the pressures that are put on someone who is returning home after undergoing a major ordeal, but not all. When I came home I was given good advice to first make a statement to the press before meeting my family. It was said that if I met my wife and children first, then, given the emotions of the situation, it might be difficult to stand and deliver a statement. I agreed and drafted out some words to be given to the press on arrival. It hurt me deeply when some time later a journalist wrote: “What do you make of a man like Terry Waite who meets the press first before meeting his family?” I can’t say I have a very thick skin but at that time I was especially sensitive. Over the years I have learnt to deal with this sort of thing but I am acutely aware how vulnerable one is at such a moment.Without a doubt the past years have been acutely difficult for the Zaghari-Ratcliffe family. From obscurity they have been thrown into the public arena and they have faced this ordeal with great courage and determination. It has been a time of considerable suffering for all of them. Suffering is never easy to bear but it is my firm conviction that it need not destroy. It will always be painful but within the experience there are often the seeds of new opportunities. In my own case I would never have been able to give up a salaried occupation and give my time to the founding of Hostage International and other charities without having known what it is to reach the depths of despair. Having always had sympathy for those who suffer, captivity enabled me to have empathy. Sympathy is to feel sorry for others. Empathy is to know and to feel what it really is like for them.Over the past six years I have kept in close touch with Nazanin and have had occasional meetings with the wife of Anoosheh. We have passed through times when it seemed that all hope was lost but with the efforts of Richard and thousands of supporters, hope was kept alive.We can all rejoice that there is some good news from Iran today. Over the past 40 years I have got to know many Iranians, many of whom are gentle and intelligent people. We can only hope that the return of Nazanin to her family will herald the beginning of improved relationships with that great country. Welcome home Nazanin and Anoosheh. We share the joy of your family at your return.                   More from News\u0026#39Is that Mummy?\u0026#39 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally reunited with family on British soilNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker arrives back in UK after six-year ordeal‘Mummy really is coming home’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to her family after £393m deal with IranPaul Pogba’s house burgled while he was playing for Manchester United against Atletico MadridMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"want mummy take toy shop nazanin zaghari ratcliffes family jubilant","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s daughter, Gabriella, has said that the first thing she wants to do with her mother when she returns from Iran is to go toy shopping.Speaking to The  on Wednesday, Richard Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife’s release for six years alongside her family, said: “We’re happy jubilant.”Asking his daughter, who is now six, what the first thing she wanted to do when she saw her mother, Gabriella replied: “Go to the toy shop.”Her father added: “She’s packed a number of toys that she wants to show her mum and various craft things. She’s started to learn the piano. She wanted to show her mummy the things she can do now that she couldn’t before.”Mr Ratcliffe has been praised for his “total determination” to secure his wife’s release under two prime ministers and four foreign secretaries, which included a three-week hunger strike outside the Foreign Office late last year.Jeremy Hunt, who previously tried to secure Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release whilst head of the department, said that Mr Ratcliffe “never wavered throughout six years of hell” and was “the bravest person I met” during his time in the role.Now her release has been secured, Mr Ratcliffe said that the first things he would say to his wife in person would be “Welcome home,” and “We’ll be okay.”Recalling what he said to her the first time they spoke after she was jailed in Tehran in 2016, Mr Ratcliffe said: “I said the only thing that matters, and that’s ‘I miss you, and I love you’.”Now he said that as a family, they were looking forward to a “new life”.“I think it is going to be the beginning of a new life, a normal life, and hopefully a happy family,’’ he told broadcasters.He told The  that he will be making a Mother’s Day card with his daughter following his wife’s release.Three years ago on Mother’s Day, Mr Ratcliffe delivered a card and 155 bunches of flowers, one for every week his wife had been in prison, outside the Iranian embassy in London, while Gabriella was living in Iran.The time the family have been apart since then was described as a “long, hard slog” by Mr Ratcliffe.He said: “We’re both in our own way a bit battered and that won’t play out today, but it will manifest in different ways.“I’m not dwelling on that now, but it lurks at the back of your mind after six years apart: ‘how long will it take to really get back to normal?’”During the process of securing his wife’s release in recent days as part of a “highly complex” £400 million deal, Mr Ratcliffe was kept “out of the loop’’.He told broadcasters that the situation had been kept “behind closed doors”, adding: “So I don’t know what’s happened. I’ve seen briefings and so on.

Welcome home.”Mr Ashoori made a peace sign to journalists as the pair walked side by side from the runway to a building at the air force base in Oxfordshire.Looking forward to a new life, said Mr Ratcliffe.You can\u0027t get back the time that\u0027s gone. That\u0027s a fact. But we live in the future.Gabriella had already picked out the toys she wanted to show her mother.By 2.30am, the Ratcliffe family had left the airport to begin the next chapter in their lives, in a convoy of people carriers with tinted windows. Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guard arrested Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in April 2016 at Tehran Imam airport while she was on holiday with her then 22-month-old daughter to visit her parents.Her captors claimed she was a British spy - a charge she has always denied.She spent the first month in a windowless two-by-one-metre cell, illuminated by a single lightbulb that was never allowed to go out.Interrogators spent countless hours trying to illicit a confession, frequently threatening to take away her daughter Gabriella and send her back to London.The charges against her have never been publicly revealed.Ms Truss said Oman had been “instrumental” in brokering the release. She was keen to separate the payment of the “legitimate debt” with the release of the prisoners, but sources confirmed that the plane could only take off once the transaction had been made.More from NewsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe latest news: British aid worker arrives back in UK after six-year ordeal‘Mummy really is coming home’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to her family after £393m deal with IranPaul Pogba’s house burgled while he was playing for Manchester United against Atletico Madrid\u0026#39This is murder\u0026#39: Volodymyr Zelensky confronts Congress with graphic video of Ukraine’s destructionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"1 4 women unable help","story":"Exclusive:  in  of women unable to get help they needed from NHS staff during labourThe Care Quality Commissions maternity survey shows that % of women were either \"sometimes\" able to get prompt care - or not at all - while in labour last yearByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments Almost a quarter of women were unable to get help they needed from NHS staff while giving birth, a survey has revealed.The Care Quality Commissionaposs maternity survey shows that % of women were either sometimes able to get prompt care - or not at all - while in labour last year. This was up from % in . Some women did not get the postnatal care they wanted, with % of respondents wishing they could speak to or see a midwe more than they did, compared to % in . The watchdog also found % of women who needed it said that in the six weeks after the birth of their baby, they ‘definitely’ received help and advice from a midwe or health visitor about feeding their baby, down from % in . It comes after midwery leaders warned that worsening staffing shortages were hitting morale.  The Royal College of Midwivescalled on the Government last week to fix workforce issues, as a survey of its members last year found over halfof those considering leaving planned to go within the next year. Shadow Primary Care Minister Feryal Clark said: Women giving birth shouldn’t have to worry about whether they will be well looked after, safe and comfortable. After a decade of Conservative mismanagement, the NHS went into the pandemic with , fewer beds than in  and now it is losing more midwives than it is recruiting. It’s not just that the Tories didn’t fix the roof when the sun was shining, they dismantled the roof and removed the floorboards.The watchdog surveyed more than , women who gave birth in English hospitals during February  as the country faced its third national lockdown.The CQC said results had declined in some areas, but added despite the pressures of the pandemic, the majority of women continued to report positive experiences of maternity care. The CQC recently found that midwives at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are worried about being “too exhausted to keep patients safe,” and that the trust does not have enough staff to keep women and babies safe. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “All women should feel supported during childbirth and receive the best quality maternity care. “We want the NHS to be the safest place in the world to give birth, which is why we’re aiming to hire , more midwives with a £ million recruitment drive.“More widely, we are driving women’s health to the top of the agenda through our upcoming Women’s Health Strategy and our dedicated Maternity Disparities Taskforce is examining how the government can continue to improve maternity care.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSCare Quality CommissionHospitalsGiving birth\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The YouGov poll also found eight in  people would like the Government to debate the issue before the next election in .It comes as peers tonight debated whether Parliament should be given dedicated time to consider assisted dying laws. If passed, Lord Forsyth’s amendment to the Health and Care Bill would require No to present a draft Assisted Dying Bill to Parliament within a year. The former Conservative Scottish Secretary changed his mind on assisted dying after his father, dying of bladder cancer in , criticised him for opposing previous Bills.  He and campaigners have been calling for a full Parliamentary debate on the topic, with a petition nearing , signatures. A recent Private Member’s Bill, brought by Baroness Meacher to legalise assisted dying for the terminally ill, passed second reading. However, it is now feared it will not progress beyond Committee stage. Campaigners believe it is unlikely enough time will be allocated to debate almost  tabled amendments. Opponents of assisted dying believe it may lead to vulnerable people feeling pressure to end their lives early out of fear of being a care burden. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean said: “My amendment is absolutely not about the merits of the case for legalising assisted dying. “It is about ensuring this Parliament is given the opportunity to properly debate this issue.” In Scotland, an Assisted Dying Bill proposal has recently been the subject of a consultation. Responses are being analysed before legislation is drafted and scrutinised by a Parliament Committee.

So when Caroline was diagnosed with MND  years later, they knew what was coming. David revealed the toll it took watching his sister, , slip away in .

Writing for the Mirror, David, of Bromley, Kent, said: “I visited her shortly before she died.  “As I sat by her bed I seriously considered putting a pillow over her face to end her agony. “ButI’d done so, I could have been charged with murder. If this country had a safe assisted dying law, she could have gone at a time of her choosing.” Supporting Lord Forsyth’s amendment, David said: “Dignity in Dying has launched a petition calling on the Government to make time to debate this crucial human rights issue. “I urge you to sign the petition so no terminally ill person has to face a death like my mother and sister.

But Deputy PM Dominic Raab failed to answer the question - instead angrily branding her claims “sheer nonsense”. Mr Johnson himself has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed.  But writing on his paywalled Substack blog, Mr Cummings said he had been in the room when Cabinet Office officials informed Mr Johnson about the concerns. I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead, he wrote. He was very cross and as he does when cross he blustered nonsense. ‘This is just … You’re just … [pause] ANTI-RUSSIAN!’ Mr Cummings went on to claim Mr Johnson had done his usual trick when I told him not to do something dumb and got a stooge to cut a deal with someone in the Cabinet Office. He added: There was a handful of people in the room who were part of this discussion at least two of who would agree with my version in court. I’m confident in predicting nobody would swear under oath the PM is telling the truth — including the PM!At PMQs, Mr Raab said: “All iniduals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of what their contribution is to society. “That includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime. “Peerages are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commissionfor matters of probity and frankly she should know better.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyJohnsonsEvgeny LebedevBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The coalition warns soaring inflation will force the poorest to pay £ a month extra for energy and £ a month extra for food this spring and summer. Yet despite unveiling gloom-laden inflation projections in next Wednesday’s Spring Statement, the Chancellor will raise benefits by just .%.That is £. a month on Universal Credit and comes after a £-a-week cut in October.The gulf will leave Universal Credit claimants £ worse off next year and drag , more people into poverty, the charities calculated.It comes after shock research by the Resolution Foundation last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after Russia ’s Ukraine invasion.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this is accurate, and fear inflation could go even higher - even hitting %. That would smash the .% peak last hit in .  Fty-nine charities including the Child Poverty Action Group , Citizens Advice, Save the Children and Oxfam, issued a joint statement to MPs today. It said: “The soaring costs of essentials will hurt low-income families, whose budgets are already at breaking point, most.” It added: “A second cut to benefits in six months is unthinkable. “The government should increase benefits by at least % in April to match inflation, and ensure support for housing costs increases in line with rents. “All those struggling, including families affected by the benefit cap, must feel the impact.”  The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost. Allies of the Chancellor believe boosting benefits would force him to raise public sector pay, pensions and other help too. Officials are also resisting any bid to give more help for energy bills before this Aprilaposs rise, instead waiting for another rise in October. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”. They added: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” A Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £ billion this financial year and next to help.

The strategy was developed in response to the controversial race review published last year. Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsThe Government agrees with the controversial race reviewaposs finding that institutional racism does not exist in the UK, it has emerged in a new strategy published this evening.Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch echoed conclusions made by Dr Tony Sewell in the landmark race report that Britain is no longer rigged against ethnic minorities.In a -page report titled aposInclusive Britain: the government’s response to the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparitiesapos Ms Badenoch boasted: Weaposre already one of the fairest countries in the world. Ms Badenoch dismissed the notion that ethnic minorities face barriers to opportunities because of their race, because a huge proportion of white people from deprived backgrounds continue to be left behind by society. Within the report published on Wednesday night, the Government set out plans to level up opportunities across the country.  The Mirror understands officials aim to tackle barriers to opportunities from a holistic perspective, addressing the issues people of all racial backgrounds face, rather than focusing on ethnic minority groups. The report states: “This government wants to address that deficit of trust both by levelling up where opportunities are genuinely lacking and countering the pessimism that often prevails in debates about race in the UK.” Ms Badenoch outlined  actions to tackle racial disparities, boost opportunity and promote fairness. Among its commitments were plans to trial using an opt-in legal advice service for ethnic minorities in police custody for the rest of this year. The Government aims to assess“better advice” will lead to “improved outcomes” for ethnic minorities after they are arrested. The report also plans to develop a national framework for how police powers such as stop and search are scrutinised.Ms Badenoch said: The apos Inclusive Britainapos Action Plan sets out how we are going to tackle the racial and ethnic disparities that persist in the UK.I strongly believe that Britain is the fairest and most open-minded country in the world, but there is more we can do to foster inclusion and enable everyone to reach their full potential. “The causes behind racial disparities are complex and often misunderstood. Our new strategy is about action, not rhetoric and will help create a country where a person’s race, social or ethnic background is no barrier to achieving their ambitions.”  Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities added: “Central to Levelling Up is equality – giving everyone the same access to a great education, a well-paid job and a good standard of living – regardless of their background.“The Inclusive Britain Action Plan is fundamental to our ambitions, helping us tackle the root-causes of racial disparities and ensure equality of opportunity for all.” It comes almost a year after the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said Britain should be a model for other countries and said structural racism does not exist in the UK. The race report Commission was ordered by No in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests triggered across the world after George Floyd’s horric death. It claimed “most of the disparities we examined… often do not have their origins in racism”. Ms Badenoch slammed critics who found the race review cynical PR, gaslighting and an insult. She said in the report: “Some of the report’s conclusions were relatively uncontroversial. Others challenged the lazy consensus.” Shadow Women and Equalities Minister Taiwo Owatemi said: “Itaposs disgraceful that we’ve had to wait almost a year for the Government’s response – and worse still that it agrees with the original report’s denial of structural racism. “Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives have once again failed to deliver meaningful action. In doing so, they have let down Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities.” The report comes after Mr Sewell lost his honorary degree from Nottingham University because of the race report he led. As the race review was published, Dr Sewell said that although there was “anecdotal evidence” of racism in the UK, the use of the term “institutional racism” needed to be reviewed.

Fellow Brit Anousheh Ashouri, who was detained in , has also been freed and the pair are expected to arrive at home later tonight. Morad Tahbaz, an American-Iranian national, who also holds British citizenship, remains in Iran but he has been released on furlough from prison.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and Anoosheh Ashoori willto the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough.They will be reunited with their families later today. We will continue to work to secure Moradaposs departure from Iran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on trumped up national security charges in  after a holiday to introduce her young daughter Gabriella to her parents. Her husband Richard, who lives with six-year-old Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned tirelessly for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year. Mr Ashouri, a retired engineer, was arrested in  on spying charges after travelling out to visit his mother. Conservationist Morad Tabaz was detained by the authorities in .The news comes after efforts by five British Foreign Secretaries tried to secure their release, including Boris Johnson who was widely criticised for telling a Commons committee in  that she was teaching journalism in the country. Her family have always denied the claim.Ms Truss and Foreign Office officials have been engaged in intensive behind-the-scenes talks to secure their release and officials finally found a way to settle a -year-debt.  Hereaposs how the deal was done. Negotiations have been underway for a long time over securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and other British nationals in Iran. Talks are understood to have intensied over the past six months, with help from the authorities in Oman. The pair are due to touch down in the Gulf state before ing to the UK later today. Alongside these talks, the UK has also settled a £ million debt to Iran which has proved a stumbling block to the release of British dual nationals. The -year row centres on Britainaposs sale of tanks to the Shah of Iran in the s. But the UK refused to send the tanks after the Iranian revolution, when the Shah was overthrown. Britain has today paid the debt, which appears to have been a signicant moment in the release of the detainees.  Officials have been working around the clock to find ways to pay the debt while complying the international sanctions imposed on Iran. The Foreign Office finally agreed that the funds can solely be used for humanitarian purposes. Ms Truss said it had been done in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. The top Tory is said to have made securing their release and resolving the debt her top priorities when she took over as Foreign Secretary in September. After meeting all the families, she held talks with her Iranian counterpart in New York and tasked officials to hold talks in Tehran over October and November.  Omani ministers acted as mediators to help free the prisoners, with Ms Truss meeting the Omani Foreign Minister at Chevening in December. Negotiators travelled out to Omanaposs capital Muscat, last month to finalise the terms of their release. Ms Truss spoke twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion Talks have been ongoing for some time over the fate of the Brits in Iran but it is understood that the repayment of the debt got the deal over the line. However Mr Tabaz is still being kept in Iran on furlough from prison and there are other dual nationals who have not been freed.

The TUC said its study indicated that the cost of childcare was putting huge pressure on family budgets. One in seven of , workers surveyed said the costs take up more than half of their pay. Black and minority ethnic and disabled working parents were most likely to spend more of their wages on childcare bills because they were more likely to be in low paid jobs. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady said: Parents are spending a massive chunk of their pay packets on childcare bills, while their wages stagnate. This is putting huge pressure on family budgets. We desperately need a plan to get wages rising across the economy or too many families will have to choose between turning their heating on or putting food on the table.  Every worker in Britain should be paid a wage they can live on, that goes up with the cost of living, and the government must commit to a boost in childcare funding to ensure decent affordable childcare for everyone. The TUC called for an urgent cash boost for the sector to give childcare workers better wages, and a long-term funding settlement to make sure childcare is affordable and available for families. Helen Hayes, shadow minister for children and early years, said: Good quality childcare and early education is essential for children to thrive and for parents to pursue a career, but it is wholly unaffordable for far too many families.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: “It is widely accepted that high quality early years education can make a lasting dference to a child’s le. “The current levels of free childcare access for working families are not sufficient and there is evidence it may be contributing to the recent widening in the attainment gap. “As part of the solution, government should make the entitlement for  hours of funded childcare and early education universal so that every child has the very best start in le regardless of their background or their family’s circumstances.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Helen HayesPaul WhitemanFrances OGradyTrades Union CongressEducationNurseriesChildcareThe economy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse - and in a bombshell development, the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. Boris Johnson said: “We’re taking steps to mitigate that to help people with the cost of living.” Yet Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to be strongly resisting bids to cut fuel duty, give more help for bills, or raise benefits or pensions by the same amount as inflation.So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know. When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. But the Chancellor is set to appear on Sunday morning TV this weekend to give a preview. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. Soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, reducing the amount he claims he can spend. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest.Will there be help with energy bills Rishi Sunak is reluctant to offer extra help on energy bills - despite soaring prices and mounting pressure from MPs and charities. Previously he announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, speculated that ministers might raise the £ repayable bills discount in October, or put back the start of repayments, currently April .But Mr Sunak has rejected Labour’s calls to cut VAT on energy bills or impose a windfall tax. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Millions of people are worried sick about soaring bills. Meanwhile, BP have said theyaposve got more cash than they know what to do with, and have compared their record profits from inflated prices to a cash machine.” A long-term energy supply planBoris Johnson will set out a long-term energy supply plan for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But it’s not directly connected to the Spring Statement and could be published on a dferent day next week.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Despite gloom-laden inflation predictions, Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed. These are both real-terms cuts that will leave the poorest struggling more.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does. Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge. Will fuel duty be cut Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . Despite environmental fears, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being pressed to go even further and actually cut it. One idea from a Tory MP is to give a % cut to vital fuel users, such as haulage firms. But it’s understood the Chancellor resists this idea, because it would not make a huge dference to the overall cost of a tank. Not compared to the huge rises coming from inflation and the war in Ukraine, anyway.Will National Insurance and other tax rises be cancelled National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street say the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling. But some Tories still hold out hope. One said: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. Meanwhile more than  MPs have backed a bid from left-wing MP Richard Burgon to replace the hike with a wealth tax on the richest %. He says the same amount of income could be raised with a .% tax on wealth above £m. There are other tax squeezes - the Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. And the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain.

A YouGov poll of , UC recipients for the Trussell Trust foodbank network found two in five people were forced into debt just to eat and pay bills. With more than . million people claiming the benefit, it suggests .m could have skipped food or only eaten once in  hours. Some % of those on the Government’s flagship welfare payment needed to visit a foodbank at least once since the start of December. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter The research comes as the charity braces for a fresh surge in demand next month when the energy price rise hits, National Insurance hike bites and council tax rises.  Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Right now, the cost of living is forcing hundreds of thousands of families across the country into a downward spiral of debt just to get by. “People are telling us theyaposre going days with minimal food, are having to endure the cold to save money and are being forced to turn to foodbanks with devastating effects on people’s mental health. “Social security should be protecting people from debt and foodbanks, not pushing them towards it.”  Inflation is running at .% and is tipped to leap further when latest figures are revealed. Experts believe it could hit % - yet benefits are due to rise by just .% from April , meaning claimants will suffer big real-terms cuts. Ms Revie urged the Government to hike benefits by at least the current inflation level when Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivers his Spring Statement mini-Budget on Wednesday. She said: “We are calling on the UK Government to bring benefits in line with the forecast rate of inflation as a bare minimum in the upcoming Spring Statement, to prevent thousands more people being forced into debt and through the doors of foodbanks. “Longer term, it is vital we strengthen our social security system so it protects us all from harm and invest in local crisis support so no one needs to use a foodbank to get by.”  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: Twelve years of Tory economic failure has landed families with a devastating cost of living crisis of rocketing energy bills, price rises, punishing tax increase and the second severe cut to Universal Credit within six months. “It means people - often in work - turning to foodbanks and weighed down with crushing debts. “In recent weeks Iaposve heard from families at foodbanks of the impossible choices they are making between heating and eating with, for example, one woman saying she canapost afford to keep the electricity bills to keep her fridge on.  The coming increase to NICs must be halted and ministers should impose a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to bring down energy bills for families struggling to get by. A Government spokesman said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £billion this financial year and next to help.  “This includes putting an average of £, more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to Universal Credit, freezing fuel duties to keep costs down and helping households with their energy bills through our £.bn Energy Bills Rebate. “We’re also boosting the minimum wage by more than £, a year for full-time workers and our £million Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON YougovTrussell TrustSpring StatementJonathan AshworthTaxCouncil taxEnergy billsMinimum wagePrice risesSave moneyPoliticsDebtFood banksInflationBenefitsUniversal Credit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old from Sutton, London, first won her Hampstead and Kilburn seat with a huge voter turnout of .% in . In her first address to the Commons she praised Britain for being a save haven to refugees and asylum seekers. My constituency elected the daughter of a political asylum seeker. Nineteen members of her family had been assassinated at home. My mother came to Britain because this [the UK] was a safe haven for her.

And can I say to Gabriella , this time mummy really is coming home.”  She later added: Can I thank all the MPs on behalf of Richard Ratclfe who texted me just before I stood up, to say thank you across the chamber. Because whichever side of the House you were in, you worked hard, everyone worked hard, to make sure that Nazanin was released.”Foreign Secretary Liz Truss thanked Ms Siddiq for her campaigning.Ms Truss also told MPs: It was only when we heard that the wheels were up in Tehran that we really knew it was happening. I was just extremely concerned to make sure that Nazanin and Anoosheh had really been able to leave Iran, and I’m so delighted that we are going to be able to welcome them home today, and the family is going to be able to welcome them home today.

The insects got into planes run by BA and Virgin when flights were reduced in the pandemic, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found after a probe into three incidents at the airport last June.A BA Airbus A- abandoned take-off after the captain’s speed reading showed as less than the co-pilot’s. An inspection found the pitot probe was blocked with a “solid soil-type material”. The next day a BA A parked in a bay nearby had a series of error messages on its flight display, caused by similar blockages, and the problem also forced a BA  to abandon take-off. The AAIB found eight planes in all were affected and sent samples to the Natural History Museum for analysis.  Wall mason wasps were found incubating in a BA Airbus  and there was an infestation of the hairy-toothed small leafcutter bee in a Virgin Airbus A The AAIB report said insect blockages were “not a new hazard, but one likely exacerbated due to the unusually low operational tempo in the pandemic”.

The -year-old hairdresser initially thought the alpaca was a large dog until the car stopped at a red light and she got a clearer view. Video shows the curious alpaca looking around outside with its head poking out, while the car had stopped. Its long dark brown neck pokes through the gap in the window as its head towers above the roof of the vehicle.  Just as the car begins to move off, the mammal retracts its neck back inside but still appears to be having a good gander out of the window. Kirsty posted the bizarre sighting on TikTok on Saturday, writing: “Meanwhile in Airdrie.” The video has since collected over , views and more than , likes. Hundreds of viewers left comments after being left in stitches by the clip. One person said: “To be fair, thataposs not the weirdest thing Iaposve seen in Airdrie or Coatbridge.” Another said: “Whataposs the highway code say about this one ” One shocked local commented: “When you think youaposve seen everything in Airdrie.” One user claimed the same alpaca paid visit to a local school that day . She said: “It was in my daughteraposs high school this afternoon, they brought it to Coatbridge High for a visit.” Alpacas are distinguishable apart from llamas by their signicantly shorter ears. They also tend to be much smaller than llamas whilst also having much shorter blunter faces than that of the more elongated llama.

You canapost get back the time that is gone, thataposs a fact, he said in response to being asked about how the family planned to make up for the six years apart.

And there will be bumps, no doubt, and all the normal squabbles we had before but, yeah, I think weaposre really looking forward to seeing her. Mr Ratclfe described his we as pretty agitated in the run-up to getting on a plane out of Iran but said she had been grinning since boarding the plane, on which she is headed to the Gulf state of Oman before travelling on a second flight to Britain.

Though he was less than impressed, Paul didnapost have time toto the store to lodge a complaint - and ended up having to skip lunch. Speaking to Hull Live about the ordeal, Paul said: When I received the pasty I saw it was an unusual shape and I thought, aposthis is strangeapos. On my way back to work, I bit into it and realised that it had no filling in it at all. I was quite deflated. I paid £. for a shell - a very disappointing shell.  I showed my friends and they all laughed at me. I was quite annoyed in the end as I didnapost have time to go back, so I ended up without any lunch. You just wonder, aposhow did that get out on the shelf apos Paul said: Iaposll still go back to Greggs because itaposs my favourite, but Iaposll have to check the weight of my pasty next time before I leave. They can trick me once, but they wonapost trick me twice! A Greggs spokesperson said: “Oh crumbs! We certainly didn’t intend for our Beef and Vegetable Pasty to be given to this customer without the tasty filling. “We’d love the customer to get in touch with us through our customer care team so we can put it right for them.  Just weeks ago, a similar incident sparked fury from chocolate fans. Angry KitKat customers sank their teeth into the confectionary classic only to find no wafer inside - just a solid choc bar. KitKats are traditionally a chocolate-coated biscuit bar with three layers of wafer biscuit inside. But it is not just the original bar showing up waferless - the brandaposs aposChunkyapos and flavoured ranges are too. One angry chocoholic Bronwyn Openshaw said: Iaposm actually quite upset because it doesnapost taste nice without the wafer. Tracy Bennett was equally unhappy and fumed: If I didnapost want wafer, I wouldnapost have bought a KitKat. Not happy. Yvonne Donnelly added: Gutted I got a KitKat with no wafers inside, just orange chocolate. Bels Reed even joked that the lack of wafer made her manager cry. Yet Logan Bradley bucked the trend and said: I just bit into a Kit Kat that didnapost have a wafer in it and honestly it made my whole day.

Everyone involved in the strip search of a -year-old black schoolgirl needs to be sacked – immediately.That includes politan Police officers who carried out this utterly inappropriate act, and the staff at the school who called them in the first place and allowed this to happen. None of them should be in a position of authority over anyone, let alone children, again. The child was suspected of carrying cannabis. Let’s be clear, she wasn’t seen smoking or even in possession of the drug. Her “crime”, as far as the school and the police were concerned, was to allegedly smell of it. And that was enough for the full force of the law to descend on her.  Instead of calling her parents or another appropriate adult, the staff rang the police. The child was taken to the medical room of the school in Hackney, East London, and stripped-searched by two female officers while the teachers waited outside. The details of the intimate search are too graphic to go into. The girl was on her period and during the ordeal she was forced to take off her sanitary pad as officers searched for drugs. They didn’t find any. A child safeguarding review concluded this week the incident was unjustied and racism was “likely” to have been a factor. The review found it was highly likely there was “adultication bias”, where adults see black children as being older than they are and don’t treat them in age-appropriate ways. As a mother, and a mother of black children, it breaks my heart to think what this poor young girl went through. You’d think this type of treatment is reserved for terrorist suspects or highly dangerous criminals, not a child at school. She was treated this way because she is black. Her parents have spoken of the profound impact this ordeal has had on their daughter. She went from being “happy-go-lucky to a timid recluse”. Time and time again we see public authorities fail black children. And then they wonder why black communities have so little faith in them. The police have apologised. Standard procedure which means nothing. And the incident is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. What we really need is action, to see heads roll and compensation for the girl and her family. I hope the young victim is getting all the support and care she needs to heal and live le to the full. She shouldn’t suffer for something that wasn’t her fault. If she does, that will be an even bigger failure.

The Queen replied: Very well.

But by simply switching off the engine while waiting in queues motorists could save hundreds of pounds, reported BirminghamLive. Motoring experts have said that cutting the engine while stationary could mean drivers end up spending £ less on petrol per year - and it is recommended by the Highway Code. By using this simple trick where the ignition is switched off as well, motorists will also be doing less damage to the environment.  The advice comes as drivers continue to be clobbered by record fuel prices as petrol reaches an average of £. per litre. MotorEasy founder and CEO Duncan McClure Fisher said: “One thing many people do that is entirely unnecessary is to leave their engine idling. This can be done first thing in the morning to ‘warm it up’ or when stuck in traffic. Even dropping off something at a friend’s house can see people leave the motor running instead of turning off the ignition. “While this might seem very innocent, research has shown an idling engine can burn through three to four pence of fuel a minute.  If you are doing  minutes of warming up, five days a week, and spending another  minutes per week stuck in traffic – that adds up to a very handy £ a year that’s being wasted.” Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts has increased by  pence in the past month. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: With the spring statement just a week away, drivers will be looking to the chancellor to end their misery by cutting duty or VAT. One thingaposs for sure: simply reiterating that fuel duty has been frozen at  pence a litre simply isnapost going to cut it.

Harley and Harry were conceived through IVF and were born at just  weeks and five days.Parents Jade and Steve Crane had been warned by doctors it could be a miscarriage as the tiny tots were so young, telling them to “prepare to say goodbye”.But when they were born they showed signs of le so the team burst into action.Now, after  days of intensive care, the brother and sister have been allowed to go home, the Liverpool Echo reports.Former mental health nurse Jade said: Iaposm so proud of my babies - theyaposre little fighters. “Theyaposre doing absolutely amazing. Theyaposre doing all the things that we were told they wouldnapost do - theyaposre crying, theyaposre surviving.  The doctors were saying the babies wouldnapost survive at this gestation. I was still two weeks away from what the UK classes as viable and the babies were given a zero per cent chance of survival. “It was only because I was at a teaching hospital and that the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically.”The couple underwent eight cycles of IVF over  years as they tried to start their family, tragically suffering three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy before the twins’ arrival.Jade discovered she had an overactive immune system, causing her body to reject the pregnancies before the couple moved from a fertility clinic in Nottingham to one on Harley Street in London.Jade was prescribed several types of medication in order to combat her immune system problems. Jade added: On our eighth cycle of IVF, we had two embryos transferred which both worked and we ended up with boy and girl twins. “I couldnapost let myself believe it, I was so fearful of a miscarriage or something going wrong. I was still in disbelief when we got to  weeks, and I hadnapost even hit my third trimester when I went into labour so we hadnapost bought anything. “The few bits of clothes that I did buy made me think that I better keep the tags on just in case - you just donapost want to let yourself believe. The couple checked in at Queens Medical Hospital in Nottingham on October  when Jade leaked fluid at home for several days at  weeks.  The babies were not considered to be viable and the poor mum believed she would lose her precious twins. She added: The doctor kept saying it was a miscarriage but I said it couldnapost be because I could feel the babies moving. I knew they were ok but was being told they wouldnapost survive at this gestation. It was only because the babies were born with signs of le that they chose to intervene medically. They were alive, moving around, and they cried. Their little cries sounded like a tiny kitten.” The tiny children were finally allowed home on Monday- just two weeks after their initial due date. Steve added: The absolutely stunning doctors, nurses and surgeons have all been part of the making of this moment. “Itaposs hard to say goodbye to them but I hope I never see them again.

The British-Iranian mum-of-one, who had her passport ed yesterday after six years in a hell hole prison outside of Tehran, will be reunited with her daughter and husband later tonight.She can be seen with a massive smile, a yellow dress and a blue headscarf draped around her shoulders while sitting on the UK-charter flight that is expected to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Her local MP Tulip Siddiq tweeted: Nazanin’s plane took off from Oman just over half an hour ago and she’s due to arrive in the UK this evening. Here she is on the plane - the final step in what has been a six year long ordeal. The -year-old was initially taken to Oman, the Gulf state reportedly involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations to secure her release.Her husband Richard Ratclfe said he was “deeply grateful” for her release and that he and their daughter Gabriella were “looking forward to a new le”. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe has been detained in the Middle East for nearly six years after being arrested while taking her daughter to see her family. She was accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denied. Labouraposs Tulip Siddiq, the familyaposs local MP, confirmed the news in tweet: Nazanin is at the airport in Tehran and on her way home. I came into politics to make a dference, and right now I’m feeling like I have.  Siddiq earlier said she had been told from husband Richard Ratclfe that Nazanin is at the airport in Tehran but “still under the authority of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard”. He told her “they can smell freedom, they just haven’t grasped it yet” The familyaposs lawyer Hojjat Kermani said she had been freed alongside Anousheh Ashoori, following talks between London and Tehran over a £million debt between the UK and Iranian governments. Both of them are on their way to the airport in Tehran to leave Iran, Kermani said.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and Anoosheh Ashoori willto the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough. They will be reunited with their families later today.A statement from Truss continued: Their release is the result of years of hard work and dedication by our brilliant diplomats, and intensive efforts over the past six months. I pay tribute to my predecessors and the Prime Minister, who have all worked hard to resolve this issue. We have the deepest admiration for the resolve, courage and determination Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad, and their families, have shown. They have faced hardship that no family should ever experience and this is a moment of great relief. In parallel, we have also settled the IMS debt, as we said we would.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

David Bailey was working with Her Majesty back in , and just like with every other job, he wanted to help her feel as comfortable as possible.So, the famous snapper began reeling off a few jokes, namely about the impressive jewellery she was wearing at the time, but as he slipped into photographer-cum-comedian mode, David accidentally forgot who he was talking to - just for a second. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Speaking to The , David explained that mid-joke, he accidentally ended up calling the Queen by a slightly inappropriate pet name, when he referred to her as girl.The photographer was making light of the incredibly expensive jewels she was wearing, and jokingly asking herthey were real, when the mishap took place. David recalled: I said: aposI bet that cost a few bob, girlapos. It just came out. I call everyone aposgirlapos. Royal protocol means that members of the public should first address the Queen as aposYour Majesty,apos before going on to say aposMaaposam.apos There certainly doesnapost seem to be any reference to aposgirlapos in the royal handbook.

Speaking about her experience, Abbey said: I got admitted for the kidney infection because I needed an intravenous drip and they kept me in for some more tests. But on one of the rounds of testing there was a bit of miscommunication - but it worked in my favour. The doctors asked meit hurt anywhere and I said it hurt to breathe, but I was referring to my kidney - he thought I meant my chest. They sent for further CT scans on my chest and found the aneurysmon my heart. I was there for  days, my mouth was full of ulcers and I had a lump under my armpit, which turned out to be an aneurysm as well.  Itaposs such a rare disease, normally no one would think about it being that. It was my second kidney infection in such a short period of time so I think that was a bit of a red flag. Boyfriend Jack Bates, , admitted he thinks without the shock diagnosis his girlfriend wouldnapost have made it to Christmas. The electrician has since decided to raise money for Dr Bergaposs research department with a three peaks challenge. He added: Her condition is a lot to take in some days, having to take some time off work to look after her, but it’s scary. The fundraiser is something I’d been wanting to do for a while, to try and raise money for Dr Berg’s research department and Behcetaposs UK as well. Without Dr Berg’s diagnosis in November , Christmas  would have been Abbey’s last. After receiving her diagnosis Abbey was placed on chemotherapy and steroid treatments to prevent the inflammation and will need heart surgery on a mm split which is leaking fluid. The -year-old hopes to be a mum one day and in an attempt to prevent the disease affecting her fertility she is having injections in an attempt to save her eggs. She added: I didn’t realise how serious it was, which was a good thing, but also when they came in to say I had to start chemotherapy and might not be able to have children, it was quite scary. I just thought I had a kidney infection but then they started talking about heart surgery and all this, it’s still strange now.  If I didn’t go in, they thought I was going to die, so it’s a good thing that I got a diagnosis. I’m not religious or anything like that but I do think someone was looking out for me, to go in with a kidney infection and come out with this. I had to leave my job because they said I couldn’t work for  weeks, which is almost a whole year, what was I supposed to do  I think also having an additional barrier of maybe not having children, I meant to be in the prime of my le. She admitted to feeling relieved to know the reason for her symptoms. Abbey added: To finally know what was causing my symptoms, I didn’t want to be in pain all the time, it was such a nice feeling to know that I wasn’t making it up. It was a relief, but it’s a shame that the treatment is so intense. It is for le and it is intense. I struggle to even walk my dog because of my chest pain. I had to get an ambulance last week because I honestly thought my aneurysm had ruptured, and I’ve never been so scared in my le. I really thought that it had ruptured and I was  and dead. It was so scary. Behcetaposs is an incurable form of vasculitis with ying symptoms, and with little research surrounding the illness, it is dficult to receive a diagnosis.

Details of the methods used on Baluchi - which date back to  - were revealed in documents declassied on Thursday. The report shows that the CIA went well beyond their usual techniques in Baluchiaposs case, and would strip him naked with trainees queuing up to smash his head into a wall. . Officers at the site - known as the Salt Pit and dubbed the darkness by prisoners - tested torture methods without approval from chiefs at the intelligence agency, the documents show. Baluchi remains in custody at the CIAaposs infamous Guantanamo Bay site and is one of five set to face a military court for his alleged involvement in financing the   terrorism plot.  The case itself has been on hold for over  years because lawyers have argued the testimony gathered under torture should not be allowed in court. The report is largely redacted, but there are several passages detailing the type of abuse he was subjected to. Officers at Cobalt, where prisoners were so broken they are said to have voluntarily put themselves on the water-boarding rack, used Baluchi as a living doll to demonstrate unapproved torture techniques to other agents.  The report details how officers used a technique known as Wailing to terrorise Baluchi. He would be naked when interrogators-in-training would line up to repeatedly slam his head into a wall made of plywood while he was restrained with a towel.The report explains: “The interrogators would grab the ends of the towel in front of and below the detainee’s face and shove [Mr Baluchi] backwards into the wall, never letting go of the towel.Baluchi has spoken before about his ordeal, with it only now being officially confirmed in the CIAaposs declassied papers. The horrors were made public as part of a legal challenge for Baluchi to be checked over by an independent physician.CAGE, an NGO campaigning for rule of law and end to the injustices of the War on Terror published an interview with the suspect on their website. In it, Baluchi said: “After US government agents shaved my head, they smashed my head against the wall repeatedly. It continued until I lost count at each session. “As my head was being hit each time I would see sparks of lights in my eyes. As the intensity of the sparks were increasing as a result of repeated hitting. All of a sudden I felt a strong jolt of electricity in my head then I couldn’t see anything and everything went dark and I passed out.”  “The US government had both my hands tied together by tight handcuffs for about  days straight,” he added. “They had to cut the handcuffs by bolt cutters because the handcuffs got so rusted that wouldn’t open with keys.” Baluchi was  in  when he was taken from Karachi in Pakistan and into US custody in what his lawyers claim was an extra-judicial arrest. The black site where the torture took place has reportedly been destroyed.

The extravagant gender reveal has sparked debate online though, as while some believe itaposs the best reveal theyaposve ever seen, others think the couple put too much into what could have been a more subdued affair. One person said: That was amazing. Best reveal I’ve ever seen. But another disagreed, writing: Youaposre doing way too much and taking way too long. I got bored halfway through! So pretentious, someone  posted. While a fourth had nothing but kind words to say, stating: This is the BEST ever reveal I have ever seen! Congratulations on your baby girl.

While some owners seek inspiration from their favourite books, television shows and movies, others opt for a name with a more apospersonal meaningapos behind it.But one dog owner has begun to question whether she was in the wrong after naming her dog in honour of her late mum. Having been branded as disrespectful by her close friends and family, the -year-old has taken to Reddit to explain her unusual situation.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. She said: My husband and I recently rescued a new dog and named her Penelope in honour of my mother who passed away last year. My family has said they think that is very weird and disrespectful. They saidI wanted to honour her, I should have taken my motheraposs cat when she passed instead of asking my brother to. Questioning why her dogaposs name has caused such a commotion within her family, the woman has been seeking the opinions of other dog owners. One user said: You are allowed to name your dog whatever you want. Your family is allowed to be uncomfortable with you naming a dog after their recently dead family member.  In agreement, another added: It’s not weird or disrespectful. My dad named two dogs, at separate times, after his late brother. People find comfort in it and your family is a bit weird for being so upset about it. However, others sided with the womanaposs family agreeing it is strange to name a pet after a late loved one. One user said: I wouldn’t want to connect my late mother and your dog either. You can and have named your dog whatever you want but claiming a name that matters to other people then includes the feelings of other people. Another user added:It is kinda odd but thataposs alright I guess. Everyone grieves dferently.

I probably would’ve assumed it was just a balloon or something. “But the fact that it appeared to be completely still was what prompted me to record it.”He continued: “I still have no idea what it could’ve been. “If you use your imagination a bit, it almost appears humanoid, maybe even angelic. I wish I had a phone with a really good zoom to be honest. “I’d be interested to hear what an expert would have to say. “Realistically, it’s probably a trick of the light, but it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” Sharing his footage online, Matthew soon discovered that he wasn’t alone in what he saw. “The most intriguing responses were the couple of people who claimed to have seen something very similar,” he said. “One person said they’d seen it that very same morning where in Scotland.” Mr Gowans kept his eyes on the mysterious presence for a couple of minutes, before looking away for a few seconds to check some of the footage he’d recorded. By the time he’d lted his eyes again, it was gone. “I’m disappointed I didn’t keep an eye on it for longer,” he said. And while some viewers have offered totally ordinary explanations for what he saw, its true nature remains a mystery.  Matthew said: “There were some definitive claims made about it, but the range of those claims proves it’s not cut and dry.“One person said it’s obviously a cloud, one person said it’s obviously a weather balloon, one person said it’s obviously a plane, and so forth.“Personally I don’t think it’s any of those things.” And when it comes to the extraterrestrial, Mr Gowans takes a nuanced view. He said: “Certainly there’s other intelligent le in space. People that believe otherwise sort of baffle me. I mean, the sheer size of the universe… “But, given that sheer size, I think the chances that aliens have made it all the way to Earth – or even been made aware of us – are slim. “There’s so many sightings these days, though, and that NASA investigation a while back was interesting – so many Navy pilots have recounted seemingly credible encounters.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaUFOs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jordan Mapes posted the picture of the cups online, where they sat alongside a note that explained how people could choose the cup that was right for them.The cups each had words printed on the front including strategy, articial intelligence, innovation, and leadership, and attendees were told to pick a cup based on what they wanted to talk to others about. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Alongside the cups, a note read: Pick a cup based on what you would like to discuss most. This will help everyone to network with like-minded people.Jordan, who posts on Twitter under the username @jordanmapes, then kicked off a debate around the idea of the cups, as she said she would simply not drink coffeeit meant she had to socialise at the same time.Many others took a similar stance, with thousands replying to the tweet to share their distaste for mingling at business meetings - especially when itaposs forced through the use of coffee cups. One person said: I would drink it from my cupped hands rather than go through this torture.  While another added: Nightmares from my days in marketing. And a third said: Strategy is literally my job and even I wouldnapost want this. Others jokingly shared what they would write on their own cups instead, with answers including dinosaurs, Fight Club, and memes. Someone tweeted: This is why I carry a Sharpie with me at all times. Iaposd have to put aposLeave me the f**k aloneapos. As someone  added: Just bring a sharpie with you, cross out whatever it says on your preferred colour of cup, and write aposcatsapos instead. But some were in favour of the idea, as one person pointed out the cups could actually be useful in the right setting, providing everyone involved actually wants to socialise. They said: I actually kinda like the idea, assuming that this is happening at some kind of conference or event where people came specically to discuss this kind of thing, as opposed to the cups being handed out to random people in the street or something. And another agreed, writing: This is dumb but % a genius event idea. Theyaposre always looking for ways to start conversations. Evenitaposs stupid it still works because people can laugh about it and still talk.

And for Rachel Jenkins, her decision to try out the £ bags offered on the app by Morrisons came with a hilarious surprise, as she opened her bag to find no less than  broccolis. Rachel, , from West London, said she chose to give the app a go after seeing it advertised online but was left bemused when instead of the iety of fruit, vegetables, meat, deli, cheese, and dairy that are on offer in the mystery bags, she instead got lumped with almost three dozen of the same green veg. The carer purchased the bag for £. on February  and picked it up later that evening, where she opened it to find  packets of double broccoli, along with one box of grapes, strawberries, and parsley. Rachel explained: I was shocked at how much broccoli they had given me!

Challenges like the terrain, and transport issues have severely hampered Moscow’s ability to advance across what is the biggest European country by landmass. On top of that, an inability to secure control of the sky has “drastically limited” their ability to utilise jets and limited their options further. On top of that, the military acumen of the Ukrainian forces and the tactics they have used have exploited Russian weakness and inflicted “heavy losses” on Putin’s invading forces.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here In a statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain.“They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres.“The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia ’s advance.“Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options.  “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This comes as one of Putinaposs closest allies has admitted Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine have not gone to plan. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russiaaposs national guard and apart of Putinaposs security council, said progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like, Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guardaposs website. But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us.  Zolotov has been at Putinaposs side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last  years in charge of his personal security. His comments, made at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, have reflected reports from Western intelligence and mark a departure from official Kremlin lines so far. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, Russia has lost four major generals and nearly a dozen high-ranking officers. It has sustained heavier casualties than Ukraine, and lost more tanks than Germany has in its army.  It was reported, Russia initially planned a ‘lightning invasion’ that would have seen Putin’s forces sweep the country and take Kyiv in a matter of days. However, now the Kremlin finds itself in protracted warfare against Ukraine’s forces and negotiating with the government it hoped to oust. Russia’s invasion has reportedly been plagued with issues such as low morale and supply issues. A number of videos have circulated on social media, showing Russian vehicles running out of fuel. Russia has maintained the invasion is going to plan, but reports from US intelligence officials have said they have been asking China for military equipment since the beginning of the invasion.  After initial failures to conquer Ukraineaposs cities, Russia has turned to relentless shelling and bombing of civilian targets. The deadly invasion has led to thousands of deaths and has led to over three million refugees having fled from their homes since February . The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said, that as of March , ,, Ukrainians had left their homes.  Over half of these, ,,, have entered into Poland, the main destination of refugees so far, but it is not known how many intend to stay here, or move in to other countries. Despite its size, Moldova has taken in , people, the most per capita of any nation. Over , Ukrainians, largely from the country’s eastern regions, have fled into Russia.

The photo taken by Alisa Teptiuk, , travelled the internet leaving behind many questions and concerns. Belfast Live has exclusively shared the real story behind that incredible image, taken on a mobile phone by an exhausted we and mum as her family fled Ukraine for their lives.We tracked down Alisa to her temporary home in Poland where she explained how the snap of her beloved dog riding on her husbandaposs shoulder became world famous in an instant.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News BulletinhereUntil last month Alisa and husband Dmytro had lived in Kyiv with their two daughters and their German Shepherd. Le was settled and happy, the children were at school, the dog spent her days between walks and snoozes and the family’s grandparents doted on everyone. Now Alisa, her children and their dog are in exile in Warsaw where they are safe and close to her mother and sister. But Alisa’s beloved father is dead, still in a morgue in Kyiv awaiting burial, and her husband is back in Ukraine trying to take care of his parents and defend their home. With the Russian bombardment now hitting their hometown hard, Alisa is living in abject fear while trying to keep her feelings under wraps in front of her daughters - but she has one steady comfort, her dog Pulya.Follow all the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blogAlisa told DogsLive : “She is a comfort to all of us. She’s old but always the same, loving and gentle. We couldn’t leave her behind. Pulya is family. She is a German Shepherd aged  and a half, she is old and grey after a letime with us. We bought her on the first day of my maternity leave when she was almost four months old.“That day I began to train with her. She has been through the happiest and saddest moments of le with us. She understands us and loves us and we love her very much and will do everything to look after her and keep her safe. No one could convince us that Pulya could be left behind. It was not possible, we didn’t even think about it.Today she is alive and doing well, she stands as a symbol of love, devotion, determination, she represents our family, the lives we had, the lives weaposve left behind. Pulya is our one constant in all of this madness.”Pulya, whose name translates from Ukrainian to English as Bullet, travelled with her family of nine plus Alisa’s mother’s dog Kolt, aged four, in a small car for  miles heading to the safety of Poland.Alisa said: “It was my idea to go to the border but it was very painful to leave our home. My father died unexpectedly on February . He was just  and Dmytro and I tried everything to have him buried, but he’s still in the morgue because war broke out on February , the day after he died. “People were leaving Kyiv while my husband Dmytro and I were trying to sort out funeral documents at places all over the city in order to bury Dad. “We went from morgue to funeral agency to prosecutor’s office to registry office to morgue to funeral agency. The sirens were sounding all over the place and tanks were driving around the city. We had collected almost all the documents, booked a restaurant for a commemoration service and then discovered the registry office had been evacuated which left us without the one final document we needed.“In the end the crematorium refused to accept anyone. So my poor dad is still in the morgue. I hope that when I come back he’ll still be there. I will give him the best funeral I can. “It was heartbreaking but we had to go. We packed five adults, four children and our two dogs into a Peugeot  car and we drove out of Kyiv. We filled every bit of space, my mother, myself and my sister, our two husbands, the four children and two big dogs Pulya and Kolt. We drove for  hours to a village about  miles from Kyiv and then we stopped.” As the family drove on towards Poland the traffic grew heavier, and then they hit gridlock and faced the possibility of a three to five day journey inching to the border. Alisa said they felt like sitting ducks. Alisa explained: “We decided to leave the village later shortly after we arrived because it was just too dangerous to sit still, even there. As we got closer to the border there were a lot of cars queuing and we were told it would take the next three, or may five days to get to the border by car. We didnapost want to sit in a queue without shelter, open to the air, open to attack.  “So we decided to walk the last  miles. We left at am. It was minus seven degrees. It was a hard trip around mountains and rivers. Our kids were crying because it was so cold. I wanted to cry too, I could feel the tears travelling to my eyes but I couldn’t allow myself to cry, I couldn’t give up. It had been my idea to go to the border, we were almost there and we just had to keep going.” It was during that last stretch walking on the road that Alisa took the now famous photo of Pulya. She said: “Pulya was fantastic. She walked a lot of the way but she’s old and she needed to stop to rest and then she struggled to get back on her feet and she was getting slower and more tired.  “I stopped cars to beg for help but everyone refused. They told us to leave the dogs, to save our family. They didn’t understand, our dogs are our family too, Pulya comes too. “Pulya is no less family than anyone . She has been through everything with us, good times, happy days, hard times, sadness and now war and exile. And Kolt is the same. He’s my mum’s dog and all she has left of her former le, he is her comfort. “So we walked on and when Pulya got tired Dmytro lted her onto his shoulder and he carried her. I took a photo without thinking about it too much. I suppose I just wanted to capture the moment. But now I know how special it is. It shows the world our love and devotion. Weaposre just an ordinary family who love each other. Pulya was  kg when we started the walk. Sheaposs  kilos now. When she could walk no more Dmytro lted her. She was so calm. I think she understood we needed to keep moving and she needed to let us help her.Sheaposs a beautul dog. She reacted calmly to being lted, she didn’t struggle. You have to remember she knows we’re her family too and she completely trusts us. “We made it to the border, all  of the family including the dogs and we rested for a few hours. We could see rows of red tents and a big crowd. A woman asked me to take her -year-old daughter - someone was waiting for her in Poland. I agreed of course. “The decision to leave our home and the journey to Poland was hard physically and psychologically and we could see a lot of people around us needing help and medicine. “We rested in a tent for about seven hours together, the dogs and the five children. We were exhausted, sad and our feet were wet but we’d made it. We were safe.Before the war Alisa, , worked as a computer specialist for a German company helping develop Python, one of the worldaposs most popular programming languages that has been used to create everything from Netflix ’s recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Her husband Dmytro, , worked as a fibre optic network installation engineer and was just about to start new high level qualications.Today work is just a memory for the couple and they donapost know what the future holds living more than  miles apart despite the success of their journey together to exile. Stepping onto Polish soil heralded a bittersweet victory because just hours later Dmytro and his brother-in-law had to turn around and make their way back to Ukraine. Alisa said: “We took our first steps into Poland and showed our passes and that was when I realised that weaposd be OK, that we were in a safe place. For a moment everything felt fine. “Our dogs passed their health checks and were allowed to come in with us but my husband and brother-in-law couldn’t cross the border because of their age and the mobilisation order. They had to go back home. “Right now I’m in limbo. I want my husband here with us but for now I must find a safe place to stay with my children. Weaposve not decided whether to stay here in Poland or go to Germany like many of my work colleagues. “It was so hard to leave my home, to leave Ukraine. First I lost my dad, and now I’ve left my husband there. Dmytro is such a big part of me, my best friend, companion, adviser. Our deep love is what gives me strength now. “Everything had to be left in Kyiv, our home, our gadgets, everything, but these are just things. The only important things I left behind in Ukraine are my dad’s body and my husband and I am very worried about him, constantly thinking about him.

The video, taken in a wooded area dotted with tall trees by someone walking through the forest, is thought to show Moscowaposs tanks fired upon by Ukrianian anti- armour teams armed with NLAW missiles.Gunfire can be heard from the distance, and the person filming pauses and steps back behind a tree as the gunshots get louder. A bright explosion can be seen in the distance before plumes of smoke waft up into the trees.As the cameraperson pans across the scene, the ground appears to shake from another violent explosion. Two more explosions occur concurrently and the camera zooms in on two spots in the near distance, where there appear to be both flames and smoke. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin hereThe video continues to pan to the right, where a tanker can be seen making its way down a path into the forest. Russia has reportedly crossed the river, as the battle for Kyiv gets underway. The Ukrainian military today said it had stopped Russiaaposs attempt to cross the waterway in the town of Moshchun. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraineaposs interior ministry, said his forces also stopped the attack in Irpin. The night was quite dficult, but in general we can say that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kyiv,” he said.  Fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv, today, as fears rise that a full-scale assault on the Ukrainian capital could be on the horizon. There are fears Putin could launch similar airstrikes as he did on the city of Mariupol and Kharkiv. In Mariupol, a maternity hospital was hit and killed three, including a six-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, today said his heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people, who he said needed urgent help.  Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the capital has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault. He said in televised remarks: Every street, every house is being fortied, the territorial defence is joining. Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in unorm with machine guns in their hands. Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away.If Putinaposs troops encircle Kyiv, they could shell it as they have done to Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials say Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian control. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su- attack jets and two Russian helicopters over the past  days. It comes as chilling photos from Mariupol showed corpses being discarded in mass grave sites as the death toll in the city grows. This week it was revealed more than , people have died in the port city, formerly the home of nearly half a million people, since the start of the Russian invasion. Described by rescuers as a humanitarian crisis, authorities have ordered workers to dig  metre long trenches as morgues are at breaking point. In tragic scenes, they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in an old carpet- are pushed into the makesht mass graves. Forty bodies were dumped in the trench in the cemetery on Tuesday, followed by  more on Wednesday. They were said to be both civilians and soldiers Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Russia Ukraine warRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shocking claims by America accused the soldiers of shooting people as they queued for bread in the embattled northern city of Chernihiv. It was originally reported that ten people had died but the death toll has since risen. There are growing fears the faltering Russian advance, beset by shocking troop and equipment losses, has led to soldiers picking out innocent civilians. Even before midday yesterdaythree bombers were shot down as it emerged , Russian troops had died in just  days of fighting. Within hours a Russian helicopter was blown out of the sky. US embassy officials tweeted: “Today, Russian forces shot dead and killed ten people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. “Such horric attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere  It came hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin was officially declared a war criminal by the US Senate as it called for an investigation into his despot regime. On day  of Moscow’s barbaric invasion footage emerged of a group of Russians executing a civilian man who was was surrendering. The March  film has only just emerged and shows a silver car driving on the E expressway west of Kyiv. As he approaches Kyiv the driver sees a Russian tank and a group of soldiers. He gets out of the car with his hands up before they gun him down, executing him. They then grab his dead body and drag him into trees nearby. A woman and a child also travelling in the car were taken captive. Putin’s invasion force is losing almost a battalion of troops every two days as Ukraine puts up a ferocious defence of its cities.  Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog As well as huge troop losses Moscow has suffered  tanks blown up and yesterday the three bombers were blown out of the skies by midday - two above Odesa and one flying above Chernihiv. The shooting down of three SU- bombers means Vladimir Putin’s military has now lost  warplanes to Ukraine’s devastating air defences. As many as  armoured vehicles have been blasted and  of Russia’s helicopters have been destroyed. The Russian Ka- military helicopter was shot down near Mykolaiv yesterday. Ukraine says Putin’s military has lost around % of its operational capability - based on a combination of the appalling troop toll and loss of war machinery. But Russian commanders will reinforce numbers by releasing early cadets studying in higher military educational institutions to send them to the Ukraine frontline. Overnight on Wednesday Kyiv special forces had counter-attacked against Russian troops, driving them back  miles west of the capital.  Plummeting morale among Russian troops has led to hundreds being captured or surrendering to Ukraine’s troops. More than , have been captured. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency intercepted phone calls from one of Moscow’s troops complaining he and his comrades has no more food, water, fuel or ammunition. Putin’s bloody invasion has been battered by logistical problems - its armoured columns cut off from supply lines as Ukraine’s forces ambushed fuel and supply trucks. A massive security clamp down and curfew throughout Kyiv has limited the ability of Russian spies and Spetsnaz commandos to trigger sabotage attacks. One Russian agent was detained in Kyiv after being seized with pictures he had taken on his phone of critical infrastructure targets. It is believed Kyiv officials had ordered the special operation to protect a vital supply route into the city from western Ukraine. Kyiv regional leader, Oleksiy Kuleba, said Russian forces had intensied fighting in the suburbs and a highway leading west, and across the capital region, “kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing”. But despite Russia’s losses Ukraine is still reeling from horric suffering of its civilians, who continue to be killed in cold blood by Putin’s military. And the relentless shelling continued, with smoke rising from Kyiv from multiple artillery strikes leaving residential apartment blocks burning. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky went before the US Congress via video and, invoking Pearl Harbour and  , pleaded with America for more weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia, saying: “We need you right now.” In the eastern Kharkiv alone as many as  have died, although that figure is likely to double and the horric toll on children is rising. Ukraine’s second city, just  miles from the Russian border, suffered over  artillery shells overnight until Wednesday morning. By day  of Putin’s barbaric war Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said  children have now been killed with many more than  injured. Thousands of civilians have been killed and the State Prosecutor’s office is working round the clock to collate details of alleged war crimes by Russian forces. Air-raid sirens sounded throughout eastern and central cities, including Kyiv, which was again hit by a number of suspected cruise missiles. A huge fire burned in Mariupol from near-constant Russian bombing - as America was understood to be preparing to transfer a new anti-aircraft missile system to Ukraine. More than , civlians were able to flee Mariupol in the biggest evacuation yet from the besieged port. They fled in , vehicles of which  have reached relative safety. The Red Cross has helped evacuate civilians from besieged areas and has delivered  tonnes of aid, including medical supplies, blankets, water and more than , body bags. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Local officials say missile strikes and shelling have killed more than , people. Bodies have been buried in trenches, and more corpses lie in the streets and in a hospital basement. With humanitarian aid unable to get in amid the constant bombardment, people burn scraps of furniture to warm their hands and cook the little food still available. In Ivano Frankivsk in the west sirens blared in the early hours of Wednesday, although the city through which many frontline supplies are transported was not hit. Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has completely or partially destroyed , infrastructure facilities in Ukraine, said Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky. Among them -  objects of transport infrastructure and  objects of le support of the population, such as electric substations and gas pipelines. A staggering  educational institutions and  health care institutions were also destroyed.Ukraine’s Health Ministry said  ambulance has been fired upon by Russian troops since the start of the invasion and  hospitals have been hit by shells - seven of them demolished.

First-time dog owners can become paranoid over the strangest of things - such as whether their has taken too many or too few toilet trips that day. But according to a vet, most owners have been making a huge mistake with their dogs, which could be the reason for their training or behavioural issues.Taking to Reddit, one vet has explained the common mistake owners make when welcoming a new puppy into their home. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. They said: Not letting your dogs around other dogs until they have all their vaccines.Their socialisation window closes about  weeks, meaning it is pretty much closedyou wait until  weeks. This causes a lot of dogs to go nuts and freak out whenever they see something they didnapost see during that period. While urging owners to socialise their new puppies in a safe environments, they warned them against taking their dog to a park or open space commonly used by dog walkers. They need to be around other dogs and other people in controlled situations - puppy socialisation classes, friends houses, they added. Make sure the dogs they are around are healthy, vaccinated, and good with puppies and let them have positive experiences with other dogs and people. Obviously never get behind on their vaccines while youaposre doing this. To accustom a puppy to dferent people and aposunknownapos objects, the vet says owners should introduce them to their tall friends, friends of dferent races and friends with beards, hats and sunglasses.  They added: Pull out the broom, an umbrella, an iron board while giving them treats and having fun the whole time. Try to let them walk on slick floors, bricks and carpet so they wonapost have fears of those things - and always happy. Every happy, positive interaction with something makes them less afraid. Every lack of exposure, or negative interaction, makes them more afraid. Your dog is your friend, not your slave. Your goal is not to make him do exactly whatever you want no matter what. Itaposs to make him have good manners, but also let him have his own preferences, too. Youaposre not training him like heaposs in the circus to do a bunch of stuff for your amusement. Youaposre teaching him how to move safely in the world, which means not doing something - biting, urinating in the house, jumping uncontrollably - that will be a threat to his le some day.More dogs are surrendered and euthanized for behaviour reasons than any other reason. When asked how an owner can socialise an older dog who missed this step during their puppyhood, the vet advised the aposclassical conditioningapos technique. The vet added: Most training relies on operant conditioning, which is the aposwhen you do desired action X, I give you a rewardapos. Classical conditioning does not rely on a given action or cue, so itaposs less intuitive. Youaposll often hear lies like aposIf theyaposre scared, donapost give them a treat, youaposll reward the fear.apos This is not true, especially when it comes to emotional responses in dogs.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

He agreed to a further meeting with the directors of Dunbar Community Development and Heritage Trustin February. Cllr Hampshire has not responded to email requests.Cllr Hampshire states “the woodland area is in pretty poor condition and there has never been any management take place”. DCWG has never had any role or responsibility for that part of Lochend Wood. It is in the privately owned  hectares at Hallhill West and North. DCWG have successfully managed a separate  hectares of Lochend Wood since .As Cllr Hampshire describes, drainage ditches have collapsed at his proposed site. It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups. This location would create a perfect storm of risk.His vision – a ‘community cafe’, open  till  – would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install basic services to the site. How could this be sustainable  Even the Bleachingfield Centre cafe, with the library on site, close to the town centre and the primary school, was not viable. He suggests young people could watch television at the hub. Why not Bleachingfield or the Hallhill Centre  Why waste precious resources Great new facilities – The Space at DunBear Park – are planned.

Tens of thousands of civilians are being killed and driven from their homes. We see the confused elderly, the frightened children, and the anxious parents nightly on our televisions. And while Ms Blythman talks of \"finding a settlement that Putin might accept\" we know exactly what Vladimir Putin might accept – he couldn’t have been clearer.Putin is not the kind of negotiator familiar from the classic business deal scenario in which I ask for a £, you offer £ and we settle for £ plus or minus a pound or two. For all the speculation about his mental health, he has been utterly consistent from the very outset. He wants Donetsk, Lukhansk, and Crimea to be ceded to Russia he wants Ukraine disarmed and permanently barred from joining either the EU or Nato. And we can be utterly confident that any Ukrainian citizens who express dissent in a future \"Ukraine\" will be labelled \"Nazis\" and treated in the same way that Putin critics like Navalny are treated in Russia. In other words, he wants Ukraine to cease to exist as a normal sovereign nation. In the meantime he pursues a policy of relentless bombing of Ukrainian cities, reducing thriving cities of the size of Edinburgh and Glasgow and larger to rubble. Sanctions will not stop this. So what does \"stand with Ukraine\" meanwe are not prepared to confront Putin more directly The technicalities of no-fly zones or other options are for the experts. But whatever the means, it is surely time for Putin to be convinced that there is a point, a \"red line\", at which the West will deploy its overwhelming force. I’ve long been sceptical of the line that we have Nato to thank for keeping the peace in Europe. Yet it is precisely Nato in its present structure that has stopped us preventing war. And, yes, I know where that possibly leads – but with each day that passes it’s becoming clearer that Putin himself is pushing for the escalation and internationalisation of the conflict. I fear that this will happen, whether we like it or not. If that is so, the question is only whether we are to be acting on the basis of our own choices or merely reacting to him – regrettably, the story thus far.George Pattison , St Monans, Fe.THE WORLD NEEDS RESOLUTE ACTIONTHE parallels between - and the last few years tell us that we face something far more sinister than a little local dficulty over Ukraine. For years Hitler and Mussolini amassed arms while Britain complacently allowed its armed forces to dwindle. They preached the right to space and the freedom to take it by force. They held in contempt the rule of law and their promises were lies, as Poland found. The point is, her fall was just the start of an obscene trajectory, and so is the current situation.An evil gospel has awful power, and Vladimir Putin’s newspeak is no less chilling for being delivered at conversational volume. Right now he is slaughtering the innocent but the trajectory includes chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and the destruction of Ukraine’s people as only step one. We should be under no illusions.Bullies don’t need non-retaliation, they need control. The world needs resolute, overwhelming actionwe are not to descend into something much worse than currently fills our screens. As a mere first step,Nato could impose a non-fly zone over non-Nato Bosnia, it can do so over Ukraine. If President Putin can be given a dignied way out, so much the better but the lives of the innocent come first.Pascal’s words stand. \"Justice without force is a myth, because there are always bad men force without justice stands convicted of itself. We must therefore put together justice and force, and so dispose things that whatever is just is mighty, and whatever is mighty is just.\"C Peter White, Torrance.* WHY are we sanctioning Russia and certain of its citizens when we have no dispute with that country We are doing more damage to ourselves than to anyone , particularly on the financial and energy fronts.Russia can sell all its energy to China, and it can bank where. Having turned the City of London into the world’s foremost facilitator and clearer of international money, we are now undoing that with our virtue-signalling action.Can Britain really afford to indulge itself for the sake of demonstrating an opinion that will alter nothing and cost us a lot Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.* AFTER last year’s award to the respected Russian journalist, Dmitri Muratov, the  Nobel Peace Prize surely belongs to Marina Ovsyannikova, for her courageous demonstration on Monday night’s Russian state TV “News” programme.John Birkett, St Andrews.SCOTLAND WILL JOIN WITH EUROPEI NOTE with interest three letters today , two from unionists Alex Gallagher, with his often-repeated too wee, too poor, no currency, no EU trope, and another from Bill Brown and his no-ferries, strength of the Union mantra. Does Mr Brown ever look south of the Border at the ious public projects which have foundered and cost billionsin overruns, HS and Crossrail to name just two  And one wonders what arguments Councillor Gallacher would usehe ever looked around him at the smallnations who are thriving mightily, somehow, without all the benefits of being attached umbilically to Westminster and England how on earth do they manage Thank goodness for Alasdair Galloway then with his explanation of why unionists desire to avoid a vote at all costs by gerrymandering and manipulation, he correctly describes their motivation: fear.Ironically though, I am in agreement with Mr Brown and Councillor Gallacher on one thing: now is not the time for a referendum. We are about to experience a period of instability and social stress that we have not experienced in my  years of le, much of it down to the policies of successive Tory and right-wing Labour governments, namely de-industrialisation, austerity, and the catastrophic pursuit of the wealth that Russias oligarchs have stolen from their people.As Mr Galloway suggests, such upheaval is usually followed by political and social realignment. Here are a couple of predictions: after Vladimir Putin is defeated the need for a United Europe will be clearer. We will see a European defence force established as part of Nato, quite quickly followed by moves to a United States of Europe. The UK will be isolated as an anachronism in a world of super states, and Scotland will take the opportunity to join with Europe as part of that process. If all of that takes  years or more then so be it, I just hope I live to see it.If I were a unionist I would take the SNP at its word and force a referendum through now it might well be their last best chance.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHY WE NEED A SUPERMAJORITYI AM constantly disappointed and dismayed when advocates for any particular cause become so committed to their goals that they fail to accept obvious truths. Alasdair Gallowayonce again fails to accept the fundamental dference between a major, possibly once in a letime, constitutional vote and a General Election. Surely even he can see that Brexit, inconceivable had a supermajority been required, has been something less than an outstanding success. There are several good reasons why a majority signicantly greater than % + is needed when seeking major long-term constitutional change.I know committed supporters of Scottish independence who share these views and would not relish victorynot wholeheartedly endorsed by the Scottish public.Jim Meikle, Killearn.Read more: Face facts over indy and start tackling real problems"},{"url":null,"title":"top-sportsbooks-online-usa-sports-betting-sites-2022","story":"Similarly, every player is dferent with distinct needs, from live betting options to competitive odds for their favourite sports and leagues.Therefore, we are conducting an in-depth analysis of the most credible sportsbooks online, rating them on a iety of criteria, so that you can choose which one is best for you.Let’s take a look.Best Online Sportsbooks .

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

To her utter surprise, at the end of the questioning, and there were some scare tactics in there, she was given her British passport back.“Bearing in mind she hasn’t seen her British passport since the rd of April . But just as she was about to leave the door, they said to her, ‘don’t book your own flight, we will sort out the flights for you’.“So after that, I had an idea that she would be coming back, but it’s always touch and go with these things – we’ve had so many  dawns, I didn’t know for sure.“But the minute she was at the airport, I had a message from Richard Ratclfe saying Nazanin is at the airport and to her surprise Anoosheh was there as well, who was the other detainee,British citizen.

Women living in rural areas across the UK are also much more likely than men to seek help with %, saying they would talk to someonethey were struggling .i The findings come as Samaritans launches a new phase of its Real People, Real Stories campaign, supported by NFU Mutual Charitable Trust, which aims to reach men in rural communities who are struggling to cope to prevent them reaching crisis point. In the UK and Ireland, men are three to four times more likely to die by suicide than women.Over three quarters of people in Northern Ireland living in rural areasalso said there was at least one barrier that would stop them reaching out for support eventhey were struggling. Lack of privacySamaritans discovered the top three barriers are concern over lack of privacy , not knowing who to turn toand stigma around mental health .As evidence suggests that suicide rates are higher in rural areas compared to urban areasiii and rural-based occupations, such as those in agriculture, have also been shown to have an increased risk of suicide, the UK’s leading suicide prevention charity is raising awareness amongst men in these environments to let them know they do not need to face things alone. Nigel, a Samaritan volunteer in Northern Ireland who is a farmer said: “The farming communities tend to have less contact with the outside world, they are isolated, feel undervalued and have many financial issues. Many are working full time in jobs and trying to farm at the same time.“From my experience farming communities are less likely to seek help as they don’t want other people to know about their problems, there is a real fear of being judged. As a farmer myself I get a lot from volunteering with Samaritans, I can be there for people when they need someone.”Real People, Real StoriesSpeaking about the Charity’s Real People, Real Stories campaign, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, Mental Health Champion for Northern Ireland said: “People who live in rural areas can feel disconnected and isolated, and this can lead to suicidal pain. “There is so much stigma surrounding mental health and it can be hard to find the words to say that we are struggling. It is important that we all understand and speak about our feelings, and that people who are suffering reach out for support. “Suicidal thoughts are a sign that something about our lives needs to change and this campaign shows us the benefits of reaching out for help and reminds us that change is possible”. Marie Nesbitt Samaritans Ballymena Branch Manager commented: “Samaritans is here for anyone struggling to cope, no matter who you are or where you are. “Mental health challenges and suicide are complex, going beyond simply where you live or what profession you are in but these can be factors. The increased risk factors for those living in rural and agricultural settings such as poor access to services, isolation and persistent loneliness mean it’s essential for us to do more to reach people in these environments. “We hope this new Real People, Real Stories campaign will raise awareness of the support that’s out there and encourage more people to seek help early on, so that we can continue the drive to reduce suicide rates across NI.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4519110.jpg--.jpg?1647425130000\n","title":"win an opportunity to meet professor brian cox","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is delighted to be working in partnership with Well North Enterprisesand Professor Brian Cox CBE to bring the prestigious Science Summer School to Northern Ireland in November  at The Braid Arts Centre, Ballymena.Through collaboration with headline sponsor Ryobi Aluminium Casting and key sponsors Almac Group, IPC Mouldings, Michelin Development, Northern Regional College, Randox Laboratories and Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies the event will aim to inspire young people to become the next generation of scientists with an inspirational programme that mixes the best of STEAMthrough a series of TED-style talks, seminars, discussions and hands-on workshops.The Science Summer School is not a stand-alone event but is a catalyst for a collaborative vision for the borough to nurture future talent and as part of the event we are asking pupils to ‘Activate your Curiosity’ by creating an original t-shirt design that reflects one of three themes: Activate your Curiosity First Attempts or The Universe.There are fantastic prizes on offer - the winning t-shirt will be printed and the designer will have the opportunity to meet Professor Brian Cox CBE in November .The best ideas will also be included in the Gallery of First Attempts exhibition in the Mid-Antrim Museum at The Braid in conjunction with this exciting event.The competition is open to all schools in the borough from Key Stage  through to Key Stage  and to enter students must attend a school in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area.

In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May.

In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaTop VideosPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlaySt Patrick#s Day: #Make or break# year for Holylands as celebrationsafter two yearsLatest EnvironmentMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedLatestSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe – timeline from arrest in Iran to arriving back in UKLizzo says she has ‘made it’ after appearing in Disney cartoon seriesElon Musk to resign from the Endeavour board of directorsKanye West’s Instagram account locked for violating  bullying policies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I’ve got lots of family and friends coming over — the north coast is going to be packed out with English people over that weekend.”The ceremony will take place in the grounds of the th century venue near Loughguile, with the reception in the castle itself.It’s going to be a “pretty sizeable” affair, with  guests during the day and “loads more” in the evening.“There’ll be an interesting blend of guests, from surfing friends and media to people we play football with,” she said.The bride, groom and their guests are all staying in Ballycastle,  miles away. “I love waking up and seeing the sea,” Emma said.“We’re all going to go for a walk on the beach the next day and hang out.“People are coming for three or four days so we’re going to spend time together on the north coast before and after and I’ll get to show people the real Northern Ireland.”The photographer is award-winning Ballymoney man Kris Dickson, who was always Emma’s first — or rather only — choice.“It was obviously meant to be because when I spoke to Kris it just happened that that date was the only Saturday he had free between now and Christmas,” she said.Emma will have four bridesmaids — two best friends from England and two cousins. The newlyweds will then head off on honeymoon to the Hawaiian islands for nearly three weeks on Monday, March .“It’s always been my dream to go there,” she said.“We’re going to surf as much as possible, and in between that we’re probably going to climb a few mountains or volcanos.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEmma with future stepson Jonah FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEmma with future stepson JonahAarondoesn’t have Emma’s  years’ surfing experience, but he’s “doing really well” learning all about wipeouts, leggies and cutbacks.He proposed to her on terra firma, at the top of Cave Hill.

It was really cold and dark and icy blue first of all and then the whole sky changed to gold and orange and purple as the sun peaked over the horizon.“While we were watching this incredible light show Aaron turned to me and popped the question.“He got down on one knee, with an incredibly beautul diamond ring.“It couldn’t have been more perfect.”Emma recently presented her first BBC’s Newsnight programme and are other working assignments she’d like to consider. “It would be great to cover American politics,” she said.The story in Europe is also going to be fascinating for years to come in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”Luckily, Aaron is ready to pack his bags and follow her to the ends of the earth. “I’m really lucky. We make a great team. He’s so supportive. “I know that’s not always easy,” she said.“He’s excited and up for whatever the future holds.”Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaTop VideosPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlaySt Patrick#s Day: #Make or break# year for Holylands as celebrationsafter two yearsLatest Northern IrelandSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceCheltenham : No fairytale ending for O’Leary and Tiger RollHope for hard-pressed families as cost of home heating oil begins to level outDaughter’s tribute to ‘hero dad’ as ex-Belfastphotographer Ian Trevithick is laid to restFamilies lap up Belfast’s free ‘Paddy’s Eve’ concertLatestBillie Eilish worried her Bond theme would ‘not be good enough’ for Daniel CraigNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe hugs and kisses daughter in emotional reunionSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe – timeline from arrest in Iran to arriving back in UKLizzo says she has ‘made it’ after appearing in Disney cartoon series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSt Patrick’s Day celebrations kicked off in musical style in Belfast on Wednesday night, with a free ‘Paddy’s Eve’ concert at Custom House Square.The event was hosted by BBC Radio Ulster presenter Lynette Fay and the Belfast comedian Paddy Raff. It featured an array of talents from across the island.Families were treated to stage highlights from the Duncairn Creative Collective, a brand new collaborative project that brings together more than  independent musicians from dferent backgrounds and genres.There were also memorable performances from the Irish duo Mick Flannery and Susan O’Neill, rising star Tolü Makay, Lisburn singer-songwriter Joshua Burnside and Armagh-born tin whistle and flute player Brian Finnegan.Belfast City Council estimated that around , people attended the free event. It is anticipating “a great turnout” for the main parade on Thursday, titled ‘We Are All Patrick’. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Starting at City Hall at pm, the colourful procession will travel along Donegall Place, into High Street, Bridge Street and Waring Street, before finishing on Donegall Street, close to Writers’ Square.This year’s parade — the first since  — has been created by Beat Carnival, and will feature a pageant of costume, music, dance, circus and theatrical performances.A giant Patrick will journey through the streets of Belfast with his hound Spioradand his huge cloak, elegantly patchwork-fashioned from expressions of people and groups throughout Belfast.The theme of this year’s parade is celebrating all iniduals and community organisations who will play their part in the city’s shared future, reminding us that ‘We are all Patrick, we are all Belfast’.Prior to this, runners participating in the Spar Craic K will leave Belfast City Hall at am before finishing at Ormeau Park in the south of the city.Police have advised road users to anticipate some traffic disruption and plan for potential delays in Belfast due to the high number of events. A traffic management system and signage will be in place, with motorists asked to follow any directions issued by the PSNI.The police also urged residents and visitors to “enjoy all that Belfast has to offer safely”.Chief Inspector Gavin Kirkpatrick warned that any “overindulgences in alcohol” that lead to antisocial or violent behaviour “will not be tolerated”.He said that, alongside colleagues from the council, universities and schools, police “have again been working hard to highlight that the Holyland area of south Belfast is a residential area, not a party or nightle destination”.The area is popular with students and has witnessed thousands of young people flocking to its streets on St Patrick’s Day for parties that sometimes result in criminality. Police have launched a crackdown on problem behaviour in the neighbourhood named Operation Exposure. Officers have asked parents and s to ensure they know where their children are and to warn them about “the impact of underage drinking”. Those intending to go out for a few drinks have been urged to leave their cars at home and use alternative means of transport, with the PSNI reminding motorists that “drink-driving laws will, as always, be robustly enforced during St Patrick’s Day and across the weekend”.Other St Patrick’s events will be in full flow across Northern Ireland on Thursday, with Derry city to host its Spring Carnival Parade, which aims to feature more than  participants. Foyleside Shopping Centre will be hosting a ‘Feel Lucky’ event from  to pm, featuring Irish dancing, traditional music, face painting, balloon modelling and more. Armagh city, where St Patrick built his great stone church in AD, making it the centre of the church in Ireland, will have its parade at .pm. It will be followed by a family fun afternoon, with free admission, in the Shambles Market until pm.In Tyrone, meanwhile, Strabane and Cookstown will be hosting their own parades, kicking off at pm and .pm respectively. Omagh’s town centre will host a programme of music and dance throughout the afternoon. Mid Ulster District Council will be having a free day of celebrations in Dungannon from pm to pm. In Fermanagh, Enniskillen town centre will be full of street entertainment, and the castle is hosting an exciting programme for families with food vendors and a craft fair.In Co Down, you can visit St Patrick’s grave at the cathedral in Downpatrick, followed by an array of free celebrations commencing at noon in the town’s St Patrick’s Square.Whatever happens, be prepared for a green and orange St Patrick’s Day, with rare ‘blood rain’ potentially falling on Northern Ireland on Thursday. It is currently sweeping across Europe, triggered by a huge Saharan dust storm.Blood rain happens when red-coloured sand or dust finds its way into clouds, giving the rain a red appearance as it falls.Satellite images published by the Met Office hint that the dust clouds could make their way from North Africa towards the island of Ireland. Pictures from Portugal, Germany and Spain have shown the sky glowing an orange colour because of the phenomenon.Related topicsSt. Patrick#s DayBelfast City CouncilPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On St. Patricks DayPSNI warn students ahead of St Patrick’s Day: ‘Think of others and stay away from the Holyland’St Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaSt Patrick’s Day: Everything you need to know about the weather forecast and travel arrangementsSt Patrick’s Day: Young people warned to avoid Holyland area as police launch crackdown PremiumReturn of St Patrick’s Day celebrations after three years set to boost NI’s economyMost ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaTop VideosPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlaySt Patrick#s Day: #Make or break# year for Holylands as celebrationsafter two yearsLatest Northern IrelandSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceCheltenham : No fairytale ending for O’Leary and Tiger RollHope for hard-pressed families as cost of home heating oil begins to level outDaughter’s tribute to ‘hero dad’ as ex-Belfastphotographer Ian Trevithick is laid to restNew Belfast City Council chief John Walsh will earn up to £k a yearLatestBillie Eilish worried her Bond theme would ‘not be good enough’ for Daniel CraigNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe hugs and kisses daughter in emotional reunionSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe – timeline from arrest in Iran to arriving back in UKLizzo says she has ‘made it’ after appearing in Disney cartoon series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestNorthern Ireland power station wants to ditch Russian coal — but Stormont says noA sit-in fish supper could climb to £ in Belfast, says restaurant ownerFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaTop VideosPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayPlayIncrease of ‘sexual shenanigans’ in Northern Ireland forestPlaySt Patrick#s Day: #Make or break# year for Holylands as celebrationsafter two yearsLatest Northern IrelandSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceCheltenham : No fairytale ending for O’Leary and Tiger RollHope for hard-pressed families as cost of home heating oil begins to level outDaughter’s tribute to ‘hero dad’ as ex-Belfastphotographer Ian Trevithick is laid to restFamilies lap up Belfast’s free ‘Paddy’s Eve’ concertLatestBillie Eilish worried her Bond theme would ‘not be good enough’ for Daniel CraigNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe hugs and kisses daughter in emotional reunionSt Patrick’s Day celebrationsafter two-year Covid absenceNazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe – timeline from arrest in Iran to arriving back in UKLizzo says she has ‘made it’ after appearing in Disney cartoon series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector.

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so. Bangor were able to scoretheir second of the day just before half-time with a deflection in a crowded circle.lsquoHinch started the third quarter with a quick push back and passed the ball up the pitch towards Bangorrsquos goal only to be met by a strong defence.Matthew Martin worked the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell and Adam Dodds allowing them to have some shots towards the Bangor goal.Hugo Melville, Ross Connolly and Ben Chadwick kept the pressure on Bangor players tackling when possible.Aaron Donnell continued to get his touch to send many balls wide of the lsquoHinch goal. Bangor scored their third goal from open play, although many of the lsquoHinch defence disputed the previous foul.

He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaPeople Mothers Day : What date is Mothers Day   Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterLestyle Jonny McCambridge: Parking problems – not in my back yard By The NewsroomCrime Sixth man arrested under Terrorism Act in Lyra McKee murder probe Gemma MurrayCrime Appeal for dashcam footage after collision between lorry and pedestrian Gemma MurrayCrime WATCH: PSNI arrest street preacher - Tatchell urges PPS to drop case Philip BradfieldNews Great news as large box creating obstruction for motorists on M is removed Gemma Murray News Laura was a bubbly girl with a great sense of humour and a heart of gold Gemma MurrayPeople When is Red Nose Day   Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterNews Covid- Travel Restrictions to be removed in Northern Ireland from March  Gemma MurrayPolitics Watch as Sinn Fein take part in tree planting ceremony for Queen’s Jubilee Graeme Cousins do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\" do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\"Consumer do it all’\" href\" business consumer a-good-business-leader-knows-you-dont-and-cant-do-it-all-\" A good business leader knows ‘you don’tdo it all’ Dr Scott KingConsumer Livestream funerals helps families say goodbye from anywhere in the world Claire CartmillPolitics Northern Ireland Protocol: Jamie Bryson in call for non-violent protest By The NewsroomPeople Homes for Ukraine Scheme Northern Ireland explained Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterCrime PSNI come under attack overnight at ongoing security alert Gemma Murray Jim Allister, Kate Hoey and Ben Habib arrive at the High Court in Belfast, where a judgment is expected in the challenge to the Northern Ireland Protocol.

It is little surprise that workers are concerned that their pay packets may not be sufficient in this time of soaring prices.One alarming aspect of this current monetary headache is that one of the traditional levers of control of inflation is rendered almost redundant at this time — rising interest rates. Only weeks ago a gradual such increase was expected, indeed assumed, to be happening over the coming months. But such a move would be so unpalatable as to be almost impossible in the context of burdened families grappling with devastating fuel bills.No-one wants lectures on pay restraint from Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, given that he earns £, a year. But it is not unreasonable to be concerned that across-the-board high pay rises could lead to a s-style spiral. High inflation, among other things, will decimate cash savings.There are urgent measures that can be done to help families such as scrapping VAT on energy billsand encouraging those who can work from home to do so, to save on their fuel expense.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Kymin in Beach Road is currently empty, but the Vale of Glamorgan council plans to run the building in a similar way to the Pier Pavilion, which it took over last year and refurbished.The Vale council previously let the Kymin to Penarth Town Council. But after a funding dispute, the lease ended and the Vale planned to sell off the building on a long lease, possibly as a restaurant or hotel.After a public backlash the council performed a U-turn last summer and dropped the plans. Now council bosses have suggested the building could be used for business meetings, open-air theatre, community fairs, weddings, and food festivals.Plans are already underway to host productions this summer of Peter Pan, Pirates of Penzance, and a Midsummer Night’s Dream. Council bosses welcomed the progress during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March .Cllr Kathyrn McCaffer, cabinet member for leisure, arts and culture, said the initial refurbishment work includes making the building safe and protected from wind and rain.She said: “We’re investing to make sure the building stays watertight and secure and is fit for purpose. We have a great relationship with a couple of local community groups who are already using the grounds of the Kymin, which is really encouraging.”Since the Pavilion reopened in April last year, after the council took it over, the building has brought in an extra £, income from the cafe, cinema screenings, weddings and art sales. The building has hosted events for Halloween, Christmas, arts and crafts, and carols.Cllr Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the council took the Pavilion on from the charity which used to run it “at the most challenging time” yet now the building is making money for the council.He said: “The previous organisation failed to make a financial success of operating the Pavilion and frankly ended in a bit of a mess. It defaulted back to us as the landlord, and it came to us at the most challenging time you could imagine for any business or organisation..remove“And yet we have managed to turn things around, despite all those restraints of lockdown, and we’re reporting what can only be described as a successful community facility—and one that has produced a financial surplus.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She is a member of GSD Dog Club of Wales Training Club and receives support from professional mentors.Luca, who also qualied for Crufts  but failed the last challenge, was unstoppable in this years event - winning the competition and being awarded a trophy.“It’s a long process to qualy for Crufts,” said husband Mr Heath.“This is the second time Luca has qualied and he nailed everything this year.“He came in first place and was asked to stay behind to do a demonstration in the ring – we are really happy.“It was a long day, but worthwhile.”The trio travelled from Wenvoe and stayed at a bed and breakfast ahead of the event so Luca could have his time to shine in the prestigious competition.“I was the most nervous watching the final exercise,” added Mr Heath.“Carolyn doesn’t look at the score as she doesn’t want the pressure so – although she knew she was doing well – she didn’t know that she was winning.”Although the trio had to head back to Wenvoe after the competition, Mr Heath had anticipated the day would go well so had a bottle ready – meaning Ms Heath could enjoy a celebratory bubbly on their travels.Due to Luca’s success in Crufts  he has automatically qualied for the event in .And –all goes as planned – it is hoped that Luca and his female friend Eva, will be welcoming puppies into the world later this year and that Eva will qualy for Crufts in a few years time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s the first thing I hear now.“In three days we play Middlesbrough in the cup, then we have the national break, and then I’ll think about a good answer. vw,vw,px, px\"Cesar Azpilicueta scored the winner “The fans are outside right now and it was brilliant to be with them.”.removeTuchel appeared as emotional and proud as he has been in his time as Cha boss, even including the Champions League and Club World Cup final victories.The German coach saluted Cha’s travelling supporters with a fist pump and a slap of his chest.Cha’s sale and Abramovich’s sanctions might have destabilised matters at the west London club, but Tuchel and his team continue to impress under the greatest of football stresses.Cha continue to lobby the Government over relaxations to the strict operating licence, with travel cost limits understood to have been raised specically for Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final trip to Middlesbrough.Gaffer x Skipper! 😁#LilChe pic hnDNouZeh— Cha FCMarch , Cha are still unable to sell new tickets for that trip to Boro, and the club issued and later withdrew a statement questioning the competition’s integrity amid those blocks.Tuchel admitted his relief that the Blues had withdrawn that statement, adding: “Let me put it like this, we love to play in front of spectators. And I don’t think that spectators for opponents should suffer from the consequences.“So I think the proposal was withdrawn and it was absolutely the right thing to do, because that was from our side and hopefully it was not meant like this.“It was not the very best idea to put it like this.

I want to pay particular tribute to her husband Richard.“It is fantastic that she will be able to come back, see her family, see her daughter Gabriella.”Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was detained on security charges by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at Imam Khomeini airport after a holiday visit to Iran, where she introduced her daughter Gabriella to her parents.Mr Ashoori was arrested in August  while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran.In the Commons, with Mr Ratclfe and Gabriella, seven, watching, Ms Truss set out details of their release.Pleased Morad Tahbaz has been released on furlough and is reunited with his family in Iran, but this is far from sufficient. We will continue to work intensively to secure his departure from Iran.— Liz TrussMarch , “It was only when we heard that the wheels were up in Tehran that we really knew it was happening,” she said.Tulip Siddiq, who is Mr Ratclfe’s MP, told ITV’s Peston programme about how Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe had been able to come home.She said: “She was contacted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in Iran over the weekend and asked to come in for questioning, and quite apprehensive – she messaged me before she went. To her utter surprise, at the end of the questioning, and there were some scare tactics in there, she was given her British passport back.“Bearing in mind she hasn’t seen her British passport since the rd of April . But just as she was about to leave the door, they said to her, ‘don’t book your own flight, we will sort out the flights for you’.“So after that, I had an idea that she would be coming back, but it’s always touch and go with these things – we’ve had so many  dawns, I didn’t know for sure.“But the minute she was at the airport, I had a message from Richard Ratclfe saying Nazanin is at the airport and to her surprise Anoosheh was there as well, who was the other detainee,British citizen. We didn’t think he was coming home, because he wasn’t under house arrest, he was actually in Evin prison.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe arrives home after six years detained in Iran article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I’m the elder brother of Columba McVeigh who was abducted and murdered in . He was  years old. His body has never found. “Columba’s remains lie somewhere in the Monaghan bogland where he was killed over  years ago. He was named as one of the so called Disappeared  years after his murder. Despite enormous efforts over that time by the The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains my brother is one of three people from that troubled past who has not been found. The other two missing persons are Joe Lynskey, who was abducted and murdered in  and Captain Robert Nairac, GC, who was abducted and murdered in .“During that passage of time from my brother’s disappearance until the revelation that he was murdered, my father and mother passed on never truly knowing the circumstances of their son’s disappearance and death. And most importantly to them, the ultimate indignity of Columba being denied a Christian burial. “Like many here tonight my family’s greatest pain over time has been the one of feeling helpless in the face of such an atrocity. We have been hurt and at times very angry too when reflecting of the injustice and brutality Inflicted on Columba. Perhaps not unlike how we all feel today at the brutal events in Ukraine. “But as iniduals and as a community our strength lies in dealing with that pain and the personal tragedies of that past.“That’s why I’m grateful to be present in this magnicent cathedral tonight and to stand with you who know what pain and hurt and loss is really about. This Lenten period is often referred to as the long walk towards Caly. I take comfort in walking with all of you present this evening. “Each year in spring the families of the disappeared attend a commemoration Mass in Armagh. We give thanks for those found and for the last missing three souls. Each year the families receive a candle to remember their loved ones for who have been found and those souls who are still missing. “This year I will be remembering two of the last remaining lost victims. My brother of course but also Captain Robert Nairac. In  while in Afghanistan filming a documentary on The Grenadier Guards, I spent some considerable time with several officers who fatherswho had served with Capt. Nairac, himself a Grenadier Officer. I resolved at that time to honour his memory. “I finally hope to bring the candle I was privileged to accepton behalf of the family of Capt. Nairac and place it in the Oratory of his former college at Ampleforth in England. “So just as tonight we remember all those who perished during our long conflict, we also remember the families and friends left behind to deal with the aftermath of these brutal events of the past. Tonight, in this place of prayer we honour our living and our deceased.” Shane Lavertywho was murdered on the Antrim road, Belfast by Provisional IRA terrorists in  commented: “I felt privileged to have been asked to do the first reading in this very poignant service. As I stepped up to the lectern, I bowed my head and quietly spoke the words “for Robert”.
