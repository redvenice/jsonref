Lol.\u0027The message was accompanied by a GIF of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson shooting their proton pack weapons at a ghost in the 1984 cult classic Ghostbusters.Anne Boleyn was the second, and the most controversial and influential, of Henry VIII\u0027s six wives.The king had his first marriage to the childless Catherine of Aragon annulled so he could marry Anne, and by doing so broke with the Roman Catholic Church and triggered the English Reformation.          Anne Boleyn, portrayed by Natalie Dormer in the Showtime series The Tudors, was executed by her husband Henry VIII in 1536, after their marriage sparked the English Refomration  Over the course of their tumultuous marriage, Anne gave birth to a daughter who would go on to become Queen Elizabeth I, but failed to produce a male heir.In 1536, Henry ordered Anne to be executed by decapitation after trying her for adultery and incest.Samantha, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is wheelchair-bound, has been feuding with Meghan since before the wedding, most often about her estrangement from their ailing 74-year-old father, Thomas Markle. Meghan, 34, and Harry, 37, are set to welcome their first child together sometime between April and May, which is when Samantha is planning to release her book, titled In The Shadows of The Duches, which, in the author\u0027s words, promises to uncover all of her sister\u0027s \u0027lies\u0027 and shed light on the rift in their family.In a tweet on Saturday, Samantha accused her sister of \u0027ghosting\u0027 their entire family.Samantha\u0027s barbed comments directed at Meghan come amid a litany of reports suggesting that the newly minted duchess and her royal husband have had a falling-out with Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge.           Samantha has accused Meghan of ghosting her father Thomas and their side of the familyIt was also suggested that the mom-to-be duchess was overly demanding with staff, and that her personal assistant quit after being reduced to tears. Last month, it was announced that Harry and Meghan were moving out of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate reside with their three children, and relocating to Windsor. Despite a steady drumbeat of stories painting a picture of a strained relationship between the two royal couples, last week it emerged that William, Harry and their wives will join the Queen and other members of the royal family at Sandringham for Christmas, in an apparent show of unity.  "},{"url":null,"title":"A look Bush family American political dynasty","story":"    George H.W.

There were nine flying saucers out in the desert near Area 51, he said – ‘flying discs’ being tested and flown and analyzed secretly by the US government. He’d seen them, this mystery man claimed not only that, he’d worked to reverse engineer the propulsion systems on aircraft that would have been ‘totally impossible’ for US officials to have created themselves.‘The propulsion system is a gravity propulsion system,’ the man – going by the pseudonym of ‘Dennis’ – told journalists in the studio. ‘The power source is an antimatter reactor. This technology does not exist at all.‘In fact, one of the reasons I’m coming forward with this information, it’s not only a crime against the American people it’s a crime against the scientific community, which I’ve been part of for some time, who are actively trying to duplicate these systems. Yet they are in existence now, basically, in the hands of the government.’And the government had gone to great lengths to keep him from talking, the ‘scientist’ claimed. He’d been warned that he’d be prosecuted for espionage even his life – and that of his wife – had been threatened, he claimed.‘Anything could happen I don’t know,’ said the man, sounding resigned. ‘I haven’t the slightest idea.’It wouldn’t be long before ‘Dennis’ was unmasked as Bob Lazar, an infamous name that continues to cause controversy and ripples in ufology communities around the world to this day. Type ‘Bob Lazar’ into Google, and almost every site, blog or thread mentioning him is niche, a playground for alien enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. There’s not a lot about him in the mainstream media, particularly 30 years later.But in November 1989, when he appeared again on television, this time unobscured, Lazar’s coke bottle-glasses and deadpan, bookish appearance became recognizable globally. His claims about working near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 – where he insisted he’d seen alien aircraft fitted with tiny seats and constructed with a then-undiscovered material called Element 115 – brought news crews from all over the country and the world, throngs of tourists hot on their heels.Scroll down for video           After his initial interview in May 1989, Lazar spoke on the record and on camera in November of the same year, revealing his identity to the world - subsequently unleashing huge waves of curiosity, support and criticism from various factions          Lazar stars in new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, which features drawings he made of alien spacecraft he claims to have worked on - such as the above picture - in addition to interviews with his friends and family          Lazar\u0027s explosive 1989 claims attracted the interest of media from around the world, he descended upon the Nevada desert - along with throngs of tourist which continue to make the journey to this day, nearly 30 years later          While Lazar, left, now enjoys a low-profile and rarely speaks about his alleged work, he agreed to participate in the new film - directed by Jeremy Corbell, right - because he says he still receives \u0027emails from people wondering what happened to me and what direction my life took since releasing the information years ago. In addition, I have heard and seen so many fabricated stories and ridiculous versions of my life and experiences that it actually became entertaining. It seemed like there needed to be something on the record – something current’Listening at home in 1989, as Lazar steadfastly stood by his literally out-of-this world claims, was a curious 13-year-old named Jeremy Corbell. While Lazar faded from the public eye as time wore on, Corbell remained riveted by what he’d heard – and now, nearly 30 years later, he has directed new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, about the controversial figure – re-investigating Lazar’s assertions and following the scientist to his quiet home in small-town Michigan.‘This concept that I heard on the radio was so transforming to me as a youth, as a kid at 13, that it weaponized my imagination,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com. ‘It weaponized my curiosity. It forced me to want to become an active participant in learning the truth about UFOs.’Filmmaker Corbell names as his mentor journalist George Knapp, who first introduced Lazar to the world and who has continued investigating extraterrestrial claims over the decades. Knapp features prominently in the documentary, and both he and Corbell exhibit similar personalities: animated but deliberate, drawn as much to unexplained phenomena as soundbites and flowery language. Corbell describes Lazar to DailyMail.com, varyingly, as ‘like the Elvis,’ ‘the Bigfoot,’ and ‘the Messiah’ of ufology.Lazar himself, however, displays the opposite demeanor. He’s matter-of-fact in the documentary his glasses, his haircut, and his deadpan delivery haven’t changed in the slightest since his 1989 TV spot – and neither has his insistence that he saw what he saw, he worked where he worked, and the US government was absolutely studying alien aircraft more than 30 years ago. (The government denied the existence of Area 51 until CIA documents were released five years ago which listed the location as an aerial test site - though not for extraterrestrial spacecraft.)‘It’s changed my life a lot,’ Lazar says in the film, referring to his alleged part in those studies and his decision to go public. ‘It’s probably changed every aspect of it … for the most part, negative. I mean, it’s really difficult to find positive aspects of that. I mean, I’m sure there are some here and there, but most of them were negative.’     A major industry has built up in Nevada around Area 51 and alleged alien research done there, with businesses latching onto the theme to attract traffic and the state even renaming a 92-mile stretch of State Route 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996 journalist George Knapp says in the film that, after Lazar made his claims in 1989, \u0027every major news organization in the world beat a path to Area 51\u0027            \u0027Tens of thousands of people started showing up out there to see whatever it was that was flying around in the desert they\u0027re still coming, all these years later,\u0027 Knapp says in the film            Lazar claims to have attended MIT and Caltech before working at Los Alamos National Laboratory and near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 neither school has any record of him attending. He counters: \u0027Do you think Los Alamos just hired me out of high school?\u0027          Phyllis Berliner, Lazar\u0027s mother, shares a story in the film about how her son outfitted a bicycle with \u0027a jet engine\u0027 as a boy she adds: \u0027You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe. There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be\u0027          While evidence was never uncovered to support many of Lazar\u0027s claims, his name was found listed in a 1982 Los Alamos phone directory and an article that pre-dated  his TV appearances listed him as a scientist with the national laboratory          Lazar now runs United Nuclear in small-town Michigan, which producers lasers and other scientific materials and equipment he leads a quiet life with his wife, Joy, who told filmmaker Cobell: \u0027I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years’‘That’s the important stuff. It almost seems like this is an intentional distraction. You need to pay attention to the bigger picture. If you really want to research all the other stuff, fine, go ahead and do it – but you really need to pay attention to what I’m saying, because I have better things to do than coming up with this.‘I don’t like being in the public eye I don’t have money for doing this – and, quite frankly, I could make up a better lie. But I have no motivation to lie this hasn’t helped me out.’Corbell, for his part, went to great lengths to verify some of Lazar’s claims. The ‘scientist’ had always described a security device which scanned the bones of employees’ hands at secret government locations the filmmaker found one on the internet, and Lazar reacts with a mixture of amazement and satisfaction when Corbell points it out on camera.Lazar had also described a man named Mike Thigpen who he said vetted him for government work Corbell says in the documentary that he tracked the man down to the East Coast, and Thigpen confirmed the information via phone. But Thigpen, Corbell says, declines to appear on camera ‘because he doesn’t want to put a dark shadow on the work he did before – but personally conveyed that was his job, that was exactly what he did in Vegas in 1989.’And various outside developments over the years have also given more weight to Lazar’s story, many claim. Fifteen years ago, an Element 115 was added to the periodic table – moscovium, a radioactive synthetic element first synthesized by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. On top of that, just last year the Department of Defense confirmed for the first time that it had financed a UFO program – after officials denied for decades that any such research had ever existed anywhere within the government.All of those developments – and likely the alleged verifications made by Corbell in his film – serve as a major boon for Lazar’s supporters. The documentary also interviews the people who know him best – his friend, his wife, a United Nuclear employee, even Lazar’s mother – in an effort to get to the heart of who Lazar really is and what he truly believes.Mysterious \u0027cigar-shaped\u0027 UFO spotted hovering in the sky...UFO investigation launched by Irish aviation officials after...Share this articleHis wife, a trim, sharply dressed blond Lazar met more than a decade after his 1989 fame, is ‘a godsend in his life they share great moral strength and fiber and values,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com.He continues: ‘Bob’s wife doesn’t care about UFOs she didn’t date Bob 18 years ago, get together with Bob … she didn’t even know about the UFOs. They don’t talk about UFOs. That’s not their life that’s not their relationship.‘However, she did tell me one thing. She said something about Bob she said, “I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years.\u0027And whatever academic credentials Lazar may or may not have, his mother, Phyllis Berliner, paints the picture of a child gifted with a scientific mind from a very young age. She describes in the film being awoken by a huge bang at 6 o’clock one Sunday morning when Lazar was a boy, after he outfitted his bicycle with ‘a jet engine.’She felt ‘scared out of my mind,’ Berliner says in the documentary. ‘I didn’t know what he was going to do next – was he going to blow up the house? Blow up the world?’She adds: ‘I want him to be happy. If vindication is what he wants, fine. But that’s up to him. You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe.‘There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be,’ she says.          Lazar looks as if he has barely aged since his explosive television appearance nearly 30 years ago his trademark coke bottle glasses and deadpan demeanor remain the same          In addition to the work he says he witnessed at Area 51, Lazar tells DailyMail.com: ‘I’m certain research continues involving the working of the alien craft and technology – somewhere in the USA, but I do have to wonder, what other projects government entities might be involved with along the same lines\u0027          Lazar claimed that he he\u0027d been threatened with prosecution for espionage and even death to scare him away from going public he tells DailyMail.com now: ‘At the risk of sounding paranoid, I do always have a suspicion that someone is monitoring me – it’s something that is difficult to get out of my mind’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Georgina Chapman Huma Abedin pictured rare outing NYC grabbing dinner","story":"    Sisters are doin\u0027 it for themselves: Georgina Chapman and Huma Abedin were pictured grabbing dinner in New York City on Sunday night (pair above)          Standin\u0027 on their own two feet: The pair were spotted dining at the Indian eatery Tamarind in Tribeca, just one black from the former offices of The Weinstein Company      The conscious liberation of the female state: Chapman has yet to finalize her orce from estranged husband Harvey Weinstein while Abedin and her jailed ex Anthony Weiner orced last year          Mothers, daughters and their daughters too: The two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same ageThe two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same age.Their sons do not attend the same school, but the women used to live just a mile apart from one another.Abedin also spent time in the Hamptons with Chapman back in 2014 and 2015 when her boss Hillary rented the mansion next door to the one that was owned by Weinstein.The mogul has since sold the mansion, along with all his other properties.Georgina Chapman DITCHES Huma Abedin after they share dinner...If looks could kill: Chris Watts stares daggers at wife...REVEALED: Shallow Grave where Chris Watts buried his wife...Share this articleAnd in a Vogue piece about Chapman earlier this year, Abedin was not shy to address the most well-known similarity between the women - their predatory husbands.Weinstein is facing possible criminal charges for the alleged rape and assault of multiple women while Weiner is serving time on charges that stem from his sexual exchanges with an underage minor online.The FBI learned of Weiner\u0027s unlawful actions after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that the disgraced politician had been exchanging sexually-charged messages with a 15-year-old high school student for close to three months.\u0027This particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me,\u0027 explained Abedin of their husbands\u0027 misconduct.\u0027People don’t feel sorry for us you don’t get that empathy.

I\u0027ve had it all my life.\u0027Christmas was not an extravagant affair when I was a child growing up in South Wales.\u0027In the late 1940s you\u0027d get a Christmas sock and inside it was a tangerine, nuts, some loose change and small presents. It was very simple but enjoyable.          The tree, which is thought to date back to 1937, sits in a painted pot and has a few sparse branches featuring the odd goose feather dyed green and a sprinkling of red berries\u0027On Christmas Day we had a chicken from the lady at the back of our house who bred them.\u0027I think we enjoyed Christmas more back then. Because we didn\u0027t have much, we valued what we did have.\u0027I was given a train set when I was 11 and I only parted with that eight years ago. It was still in mint condition with its original box.\u0027These days, some children get thousands of pounds spent on them and don\u0027t appreciate it because they\u0027re used to having so much.\u0027My father had to start work down the mine at the age of 13 because his mother had been widowed twice, there were four children to feed and the rent had to be paid. He worked in mining for 49 years.\u0027He retired at 62 and lived until he was 77. He was a lovely, strong man - my parents were what I call good folk. The village where I grew up had a strong community spirit. Money was scarce but we always had one good cooked meal a day.\u0027Now Steve, who has lived in Leicestershire for 51 years, is looking forward to Christmas 2018 - but without his family festive tree.He added: \u0027Let\u0027s hope it finds an exciting new home and puts a sparkle into Christmas for generations to come.\u0027Last Christmas, a similar tree - without any decorations - sold for £420 at Hansons and was bought by the American Christmas Tree Association.Department store Woolworths started selling some of the first mass-produced artificial trees in the 1920s.Piers Morgan believes Meghan Markle is \u0027acting her  way to top\u0027Cyclist argues with officer after refusing to remove his maskMichelle Obama talks about her memoirs at the Royal Festival HallDoctors battle to save sisters critically ill from anorexiaThis quick-thinking driver deals with car wash queue-jumperWilliam and Kate arrive in festive style at Kensington PalaceGovernment ministers found in contempt of ParliamentMan in video vanishes moments before a truck explodesCabinet members \u0027confident\u0027 Brexit deal will be voted throughAerial footage shows remains of Lockerbie plane in scrapyardTony Blair: Second referendum is only way to resolve Brexit"},{"url":null,"title":"Cressida Dick reveals 180 heavily armed gangs roam streets London","story":"Cressida Dick, the head of the Met Police, said that there are 180 gangs in the capital \u0027working hard\u0027 to recruit young children          Researchers have attempted to map the \u0027territories\u0027 of London\u0027s many competing gangsHowever, she insisted knife injuries among under 25s were starting to drop after police increased the use of stop and search powers and erted road police officers to troubled areas.Ms Dick said: \u0027I think we are beginning to see the tide turning in that we are putting more officers on the streets, we\u0027re doing more stop and search, we\u0027re seizing more knives, we\u0027re seizing more firearms, we\u0027re arresting more people for knife and gun crime.\u0027And we are begining to see, after three years of knife crime increasing and gun crime increasing, they are now not just levelling off, they are coming down.\u0027Wild West shoot-out in Wimbledon: Police hit man in exchange...Ex-Labour frontbench MP is accused of wasting police time...Share this articleThe Commissioner backed the use of \u0027tactical contact\u0027 by police, which has seen police drivers knocking into moped muggers who refuse to stop.During a phone-in on LBC radio, Ms Dick was also asked about Joshua Gardner, who attacked a motorist with a zombie knife in south London, but walked free from court on a suspended sentence.The Commissioner said police had referred the case to the Attorney General, who can bring appeals against sentences which are considered \u0027unduly lenient\u0027.

Hill-walkers Myrddyn Phillips (pictured) and Aled Williams have used sophisticated GPS technology to double check the length of the drop - and found it 19ft bigger than thought\u0027Some of the boulders are over 7ft high and finding the lowest point between Foel Penolau and its neighbouring higher hill was like finding a needle in a haystack.\u0027After a lot of work we were satisfied with our efforts and proceeded to visit the summit to gather further data from its two tops.\u0027The hill-walkers carried out the survey using sophisticated Trimble GeoXH 6000 equipment, which works in a similar way to a car\u0027s satellite navigation system as it collects data from orbiting satellites, making it capable of much more accuracy in both height and position.Mr Phillips, 57, from Welshpool, mid-Wales, added: \u0027Foel Penolau is one of the most impressive mountains in Wales as it has a sheer south face forming an almost impenetrable cliff, and it is this cliff that has deposited the large boulders at its col.          The hill-walkers carried out the survey using sophisticated Trimble GeoXH 6000 equipment, which works in a similar way to a car\u0027s satellite navigation system as it collects data from orbiting satellites, making it capable of much more accuracy in both height and position\u0027I spent many hours during the second survey taking seven further data sets that give a good height spread for the land making up the boulder field.\u0027It is quite a find as this is the first time since the Hewitts were published in 1992 that a hill has been reclassified a mountain because of its col.\u0027It is a stunning mountain and a very worthy addition to the mountain ranks..\u0027The list of Hewitts has been compiled by Britain\u0027s leading hill list author, Alan Dawson.

All of them are written in Leonardo’s mirror script and shine light on how ahead of his time he was.Before Gates, the Codex Leicester was owned by the American oil tycoon Armand Hammer, who purchased it in 1980. Before that it was in Britain, passed down through the Leicester family after Thomas Coke, later the Earl of Leicester, bought it on his grand tour of the European continent in 1719.About a third of the notebook has writings and drawings that relate to water, with Leonardo speculating on the outcomes when different-shaped objects are thrown into water.It also includes a discussion on submarine warfare in which he describes how it might be possible to extend the time a person can stay under water and how that might have possible military uses.The Codex Arundel is the world’s second-biggest compilation of Leonardo pages and features everything from treatises on mechanics and bird flight to drawings of underwater breathing apparatus, as well as riddles, prophecies and notes for himself.Andrea Clarke, the exhibition’s lead curator, said the notebooks showed just how dynamic a thinker Leonardo was and how he made a multitude of connections between phenomena and disciplines.It will be the first time the notebook has been seen in the UK since Gates bought it. A plan to loan it to the V\u0026ampA in 2006 foundered because of a disagreement over security arrangements.The library announced the exhibition as part of a 2019 programme that includes a show exploring Buddhism, opening in October, and an exhibition opening in April about the act of writing itself, which will feature exhibits including a wax tablet with the homework of an Egyptian child dating from 2AD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/810ffa04af6cbc3994b891113bb6b66f40756ac9/0_0_3543_2885/master/3543.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=73f8f0c43886820ad3a0ea0470f37f73 2020w","title":"mervyn king theresa may brexit deal mark carney","story":"Ex-Bank of England governor hits out at No 10, Treasury and his successor Mark CarneyMervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has launched a stinging attack on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, likening it to the appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s.In a sweeping attack on No 10, the Treasury and his successor, Mark Carney, the Brexit-supporting King said the political elite was allowing the UK to become a vassal state that would be forced to accept Brussels diktats. He described the deal negotiated by the government as “incompetence of a high order”.He said Britain’s ports were not ready for a shift to World Trade Organization rules for the country’s exports and imports with the EU.King, however, slammed May’s deal as “a muddled commitment to perpetual subordination from which the UK cannot withdraw without the agreement of the EU”.He added: “It simply beggars belief that a government could be hellbent on a deal that hands over £39bn while giving the EU both the right to impose laws on the UK indefinitely and a veto on ending this state of fiefdom.”The government, he said, should have prepared for the prospect of no deal in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 referendum.“Instead, the government pretended that everything could be postponed until an imaginary long-term deal could be negotiated. This was naive at best, and in the event has proven disastrous. And so Project Fear turned into Project Impossible. It is incompetence on a monumental scale,” he said, in a comment piece for Bloomberg.The Whitehall elite had been proved wrong during previous periods of uncertainty and been found to be wrong again with predictions of an economic downturn following the referendum in 2016, he said.King outlined “three episodes in modern history” when the British political class had failed. “In the 1930s, with appeasement in the 1970s, when the British economy was the ‘sick man’ of Europe and the government saw its role as managing decline and now, in the turmoil that has followed the Brexit referendum. In all three cases, the conventional wisdom of the day was wrong,” he said.The former governor criticised Carney and the Bank of England for its warnings last week that Britain would suffer an economic shock if it left the EU without a deal. King said the Bank had been “unnecessarily drawn in to this project”.Appearing before MPs on Tuesday, Carney defended Threadneedle Street’s record from critics who accused it of producing “dubious” and “highly speculative” forecasts of a deep recession following a no-deal Brexit.Carney said the scenarios, which were commissioned by parliament and set out by the BoE last week, were based on detailed work to ensure banks and other lenders were ready for Brexit, and were not off-the-cuff predictions.“There’s no exam crisis. We didn’t just stay up all night and write a letter to the Treasury committee,” Carney said at a hearing in parliament. “You asked for something that we had … and we gave it to you.”King, who was governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013, said he backed the comments of the Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, who described the Bank’s Brexit calculations, which also included a catastrophic loss of trade, investment and productivity, as “dubious”.Carney also said stress tests on the banks had shown they could withstand any Brexit shocks and allow people to sleep “soundly at night”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8e0bd7277d70b7f4b0ad113e8198b968cc6869d/0_55_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46ad66ba840053086146c87a23a57ed6","title":"thomas cook to slip out of ftse 250 index in quarterly review","story":"Aston Martin is slated to join index as Royal Mail drops out of blue-chip FTSE 100The travel company Thomas Cook is to drop out of the FTSE 250 after a sharp fall in the market value of the company.On the flip side, Aston Martin is poised to enter the index two months after the luxury carmaker made its debut on the London Stock Exchange.Index provider FTSE Russell will confirm the changes to its indices on Wednesday, after a quarterly review based on companies’ market value at the close of trading on Tuesday.In the FTSE 100 index, Royal Mail is expected to be the only firm to drop out.

Some of the Indian Empress’s senior crew have not left the vessel since it was abandoned and are owed up to $92,000 each in unpaid wages.The yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John’s baby grand piano, was sold to Maltese-registered firm Sea Beauty Yachting Limited for €35m (£31.2m) in September. It was renamed Neom and listed for private charter at a cost of £670,000-a-week.Danny McGowan, the international organiser of Nautilus, said: “We are glad that we were able to help our members in this way. It is so important that maritime professionals working onboard superyachts join Nautilus before they encounter this type of issue, as waiting until they have a problem normally means that it is too late.“If the shipowner had a relationship with Nautilus, we are sure that we could have resolved the issue without resorting to arresting and selling the vessel. Again, we issue our call to superyacht owners, managers and other potential strategic partners to work with us in order to try and prevent situations escalating as they did here.”Mallya, the self-proclaimed “King of the Good Times”, was arrested in London last year over allegations he supported the Force India Formula One team with money-laundered cash.Indian authorities are seeking his extradition to face trial in India.

Like picadors, they are entering the ring to soften up Theresa May’s deal, before parliament’s serious matadors get to work. They are poking and stabbing and drawing blood. The Commons has ordered the attorney general’s advice to be published in full, against the prime minister’s wishes, and this will be done immediately. At the same time, the European court of justice has declared that article 50 can be revoked within the next two years. Neither is seismic. Both further muddy the waters. But both are a sort of progress.The prime minister is foolish. The argument for not publishing the details of what staying in the custom union involves was trivial. Of course “advice is secret”, but it is no time for secrecy when the Brexit debate has been enveloped in mendacity for two years. The attorney general’s bombastic claim on Monday, that concealment was “in the national interest”, was unconvincing.There is clearly a major legal difficulty about the conduct of the transition period, and the famous backstop as it applies to Ireland. It has never made sense – and no leaver has succeeded in pretending the UK can leave the EU’s customs union without an agreement on the Irish border. As long as Northern Ireland is in the UK it is a cross we have to carry. No agreement, no leave. It is as plain as English. They live in cloud cuckoo land.Now Brexiters and remainers, hard and soft, can discuss legal realities rather than hysterical rumour. The advice, which is known to be unhelpful to May’s cause, does not serious damage her already battered cause. It merely restates what we know: that the only available deal remains the only available deal, and it was never going to be wholly palatable.That the government was found to be in contempt by 311 votes to 293 is more serious. It indicates major weakness in the loyalty department. It also indicates the poverty of advice available to Downing Street. The vote was surely predictable, and – since the loss is embarrassing – avoidable. Why not concede it in advance? Every Churchill needs his Alanbrooke. May is worryingly short of one.The European court of justice decision on article 50 is harder to read. It was sought by a band of remainers, eager to construct circumstances in which a second referendum might include a vote not to leave. But constructing such a referendum gets harder by the day – along with uncertainty as to its outcome. To call one without a new deal on the table would be reckless. It thus must strengthen the case for the deal, if only to move forward.May’s package has been agreed by the other members of the EU, rather impressively. It is built around temporary membership of the customs union, which we are told an overwhelming majority of MPs support. May has simply got to mobilise them. These representatives must move on to the next stage – and set the economy and the nation’s mind at rest. The deal is only transitional. Both sides will live to fight another day, heaven help us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33668c2ab740faab30e074e5f0cee476b14665b/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b717ca08ade2b3d7b601462f07cd6f49","title":"the guardian view on brexit the beginning of the end","story":"Brexit is often sold by its most committed supporters on the right as a constitutional version of the economic doctrine of Thatcherism, a clean break with the failed policies of the past. These fanatics succeeded in convincing David Cameron, who was prone to flattery but supine in the face of aggression, that a popular vote in a referendum was a remedy for the unrepresentative nature of Westminster politics. Once they did away with Mr Cameron, they installed Theresa May and carried on with legislative manoeuvring to enable an irreversible transformation of society. The hard Brexiters are ruthless about the means, and in denial about the fall-out of their desires. Yet now the game is up.The evidence is that a departure from the European Union on WTO terms would blow up large parts of the British economy. There would be a lot of pain for some far-off gain. As it stands Mrs May’s Brexit plan will not get parliamentary approval. She warns this means we will crash out as the law states the United Kingdom will leave the EU on the 29 March at 11pm. But that can be changed if a minister proposes a new law erasing that time and date and parliament votes for it. The UK has options. It can unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU. The majority of MPs in parliament accept hard Brexit utopias cannot be built. It is now a question of how, not when or if, they will move parliamentary motions to demonstrate their strength. Their aim will be to get ministers to defer or rescind Britain’s departure from the European club. Mrs May, if she is still prime minister, at this point could do the country a favour and stop her car crash of Brexit continuing. If ministers refuse to bow to such a motion then we will enter a constitutional crisis whose size will dwarf anything we have seen so far in the contempt arguments over the failure to publish ministers’ Brexit legal advice.This marks the end of a long spell of party government. In 2015 the Conservative party won the majority of parliamentary seats for the first time in 23 years. Mr Cameron became prime minister. His government was responsible not to the parliament, but to Tory MPs who relied for their electoral success on the party organisation, which in turn controlled the parliamentary party. The 2017 election saw Mrs May lose her majority and MPs lose their instant allegiance to her and her machine. She ought to have dropped the hard Brexit rhetoric then and there. Instead she continued and attempted to rule through decree while pushing the biggest geopolitical shift this country has faced in decades. She factionalised her party, sharpening ideological isions between “Global Britain” and “Make Britain Great Again” Tories that have proved too wide to manage.The result is Mrs May ended up only passing bills that have complete support within her own party, which was in thrall to rightwing absolutists. The danger of this way of running Westminster is that it ends up being self-reinforcing, making for more extreme partisanship and deeper deadlock. Studies show barely two in 10 people now think the current system of governing Britain is good at performing any of its key functions. In parliamentary systems, gridlock is relatively rare. When prime ministers can no longer command legislative support, the impasse is resolved by a new election. If she attempted to do this anytime soon, Mrs May would surely be deposed. The prime minister has caught herself in a Brexit straightjacket that gets tighter the more she struggles. There is scope for a Houdini-like escape for Britain. But to achieve what seems the impossible requires a politician prepared to imagine it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63abd9ece716a26fbc5825f0fef28fd0ac3a8b4/0_240_7239_4344/master/7239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a293cbbe60eb5db279a66ffac552bf3","title":"pitt rivers museum oxford maasai colonial artefacts","story":"Western museums are full of plundered objects. So what happened when a Maasai delegation travelled to the UK to discover where their sacred belongings ended up?Around a large table in a bright room in the University of Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, four members of the Maasai tribe from east Africa are inspecting a small object. It has been carefully placed in front of them by a curator wearing special handling gloves. The Maasai say that it is a bracelet, an orkatar. They talk between themselves, in the maa language, about what the bracelet is used for. “This is something that cannot be sold or given,” says Yannick Ndoinyo, a junior elder from Loliondo, northern Tanzania. The orkatar symbolises the death of a father and is a form of inheritance that passes down the generations. How did it end up in a museum in Oxford? Perhaps it was stolen from the original owner or given away under duress. According to the database, it was “donated” to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1904 by Alfred Claud Hollis, a colonial administrator in British East Africa.This encounter between the Pitt Rivers, one of the most important ethnological museums in the world, and the Maasai is part of a process of cultural decolonisation. The relationship began when Maasai activist Samwel Nangiria visited the museum in November last year for a conference. The Pitt Rivers has more than 300,000 objects in its collection, many of which were “acquired” by colonial functionaries, missionaries and anthropologists in the heyday of the British empire. The museum itself is curated in a peculiar style – in line with the request of benefactor Augustus Pitt Rivers – with objects organised according to type rather than place of origin. This Victorian aesthetic has been consciously upheld: the Pitt Rivers is often referred to as a “museum of a museum”. There are shrunken heads from the Amazon and rudimentary tools from India a magisterial totem pole from the Haida community in Canada towers above the central, darkened atrium.Nangiria, a purposeful and diplomatic presence, expressed his displeasure to the museum’s director, Laura Van Broekhoven. She sent him a copy of the museum’s strategic plan for the future and invited him back. Keenly aware of its problematic origins, the Pitt Rivers, like many museums, engages “originating communities” – in the museum-world lingo – to allow them to reclaim the narrative around their objects. Last month, Nangiria, with four other Maasai from Tanzania and Kenya, and help from the Oxford-based NGO InsightShare, returned to do so.One purpose of the weeklong visit was to provide the museum with more accurate information. The database was littered with errors and gaps: it transpires that an object marked as a Maasai bracelet is actually an anklet a trinket made for an unknown purpose in fact plays a vital role in circumcision rituals. After a Maasai sword is laid down on the table, Marina de Alarcón, joint head of collections, tells us that the museum takes great care when holding arrows, assuming that their tips – as is Maasai custom – are poisoned. Francis Shomet Ole Naingisa, a village elder, duly confirms this: “If the poison mixes with your blood then you have five minutes left.”The relationship between European museums and the people from whom their collections were taken has never been more fraught. The same week as the Maasai visit, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, governor of Easter Island, begged for the return of the Hoa Hakananai’a statue from the British Museum in a tearful message that went viral: “You, the British people, have our soul.”A few days later came the publication of a report commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron, who had expressed his desire to see colonial-era items in France returned to Africa. Macron has his own reasons for this type of cultural diplomacy: it eases the passage of further economic and military cooperation with Francophone Africa. Nonetheless, the report is bold, recommending that France return African treasures if governments request them.Museums handle the question of repatriation as delicately as their objects. The Museum Association’s policy statement notes that it is a “complex issue involving a range of emotional, ethical, legal and political factors”. In my interviews I heard suspicion from some in the museum world about the politicised nature of state-to-state transactions, while the legal framework governing returns can be ambiguous, as has been with the case with recovering art stolen during the second world war. The British Museum has agreed to hold talks about Hoa Hakananai’a, but a likely conclusion will be a temporary return on loan, as was the case with Nigeria’s Benin bronzes.Will the Maasai be able to facilitate the return of sacred objects? Van Broekhoven tells me over email that “in principle”, and provided they find funding, the museum is ready to “learn together how we might envision new ways of redress”. The words are carefully chosen. Nangiria, ever the diplomat, suggests an alternative solution in one of our conversations: inviting elders to perform a spiritual ceremony that will “disconnect” the objects from their cultural function, allowing the Maasai to actively donate them to the museum. The museum will wait to hear from the elders to “jointly decide” on the next steps in the partnership.At a public event on the final day of their visit, the five Maasai, led by Scholastica Ene Kukutia, a women’s rights activist from Kenya, perform a ritual in the museum. Standing on the balcony overseeing the collection, sporting red shukas and bejewelled with earrings and necklaces that chime as they move, the group sing a melodious incantation that speaks of a meeting between “great cultures”. Attendees cry, as does Nangiria. He thanks the museum for “opening its doors” to them.But history always finds a way to seep through to the present, especially in a city like Oxford. The day before, I joined the Maasai at the university’s Weston Library. Enduring the November cold, they posed for a photograph on a balcony that frames the city’s skyline: implacable limestone that speaks of centuries of imperial wealth. Inside, they were shown archival maps of Maasai territory. The British engineered a forced migration, at gunpoint, of the Maasai at the turn of the century, moving them from one of the most fertile plains of Kenya to a drier part of Tanzania. Nangiria pores over the maps to see the changing contours of his people’s land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fb8b94ddebe668a279829986bd0754c03af349/0_176_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318f48b259a4f84e6ba09c367259e17c","title":"what went wrong with the netflix marvel bromance","story":"The streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil, shortly after giving Luke Cage and Iron Fist the chop. Is the age of the superhero over?Musicians, actors, crimefighters, they should all follow the same advice: get a trade. Something to fall back on. You know, just in case you don’t make the big time, or Netflix cancels your series.Let’s not worry, then, about Matt Murdock now that the streaming giant has pulled the plug on Daredevil after three solid, if unspectacular, seasons. While his days getting his hands dirty in Hell’s Kitchen might now have been drawn to an end, hopefully the not-really-blind martial artist can get back to his day job: practising law.Given the news in October that Murdock’s partners in crime-fighting, fellow Defenders Luke Cage and Iron Fist, were also getting the (karate) chop, perhaps the writing was on the wall. If it was, however, it wasn’t visible to Daredevil’s writing staff, who were, according to one of the writers, mid-meeting, throwing about ideas for the fourth season when they got news of the cancellation. While I probably don’t want to sit through another 13 hours of Daredevil doing what should really take him only six, it would be interesting to know what they had in store.There’s no news as yet on the fourth Defender, Jessica Jones, or The Punisher, breakout star of Daredevil’s second run, but with both due to return to our screens next year – Jones’s third season started filming in June, and the second series of The Punisher is nearing completion – it seems unlikely that Netflix would leave them unaired. It’s also just as unlikely these two would be singled out for a stay of execution, especially given what a slog Jones’s second season was. Expect announcements in the near future, but good luck to anyone who has to tell Jon Bernthal he can’t play Frank Castle any more. Email might be best with that one.So why the cancellations? Quality could be one reason. Executives might have had enough of fair-to-middling superhero adventures that cost a fortune to make. Daredevil’s recent third series served up more of the expected blend of staggering fight scenes – Murdock and Bullseye’s stationery-based face off was thrilling – while Kingpin once again proved to be Marvel’s best on-screen baddie, even if he had to negotiate boring dialogue and a stagnant plot.Iron Fist was mostly terrible, even if the second run was an improvement on the first, and Luke Cage managed to make a show about a bulletproof man, who was also superhumanly strong, deathly dull. Viewing figures – not something Netflix is very forthcoming with – aren’t available, but reports suggest the numbers were down from one series to the next. The Defenders, the small-screen Avengers, if you will, apparently saw figures drop with each episode.It’s not quality and figures that seem to be at the heart of these cancellations, but business. Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, makers of these series, is launching its own streaming service, called Disney+, and it’s highly unlikely it wants valuable characters fighting crime on another service.Marvel waved goodbye to Daredevil with a message saying it “looks forward to more adventures with the Man without Fear in the future”, hinting that there could be a life beyond Netflix – a big-screen reboot, perhaps? – although Disney’s family-friendly image would probably stop it just continuing the grisly series as it is, while Netflix still owns the streaming rights to these axed characters, and will indeed keep the series on its platform for the foreseeable future. How smart a move that is, however, will reveal itself in due course. Netflix’s Marvel series are all heavily stylised and feature consistent branding. As its collaborator becomes a competitor, does it really want to carry what is essentially an advert for not just a rival streaming service, but the company that is probably going to withdraw most of its content from Netflix?If you’re worried where your next superhero series is coming from, fear not. Neither firm is going to go without, with Netflix launching its own universe in collaboration with Mark Millar, and Disney+ reportedly planning live-action TV shows featuring Loki, Scarlet Witch, the Winter Soldier and any of its other MCU characters it doesn’t think warrant a whole film. There’ll also be a raft of animated Marvel content.The age of the superhero is far from over. Perhaps Matt Murdock won’t need to go back to the day job just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236464e898aefc157ff3e4265eae66eff905664c/0_90_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87e32576502484fddec7c9c525323022","title":"the lowdown on ottawa canadas capital city","story":"Whether you want to do mass yoga, visit parliament, try a BeaverTail pastry or ice skate on the Rideau canal – Ottawa has something for every visitor …The city of Ottawa has a wonderful setting, its centre perched on cliffs above the churning Ottawa River and overlooking the peaceful rolling forests of the Gatineau Hills. Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping. Barack Obama made sure he got one when he visited as president in 2009.Tours of Ottawa’s gothic parliament buildings are not to be missed you can visit both the House of Commons and the new Senate to observe democracy in action. The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing. Instead, don’t worry about the temperatures – Ottawa always seems to take the climate in its stride.Take to the river in the summer months you can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River. The city is also the master of the big occasion and leads the nation’s Canada Day celebrations on 1 July.

Fun-loving, festival-obsessed Montreal itself is a bustling metropolis, home to nearly 2 million people, while the province’s capital, Québec City, may be more modestly sized but packs a historical punch.The mighty St Lawrence River slices through Québec’s south-eastern edge, lined on either side with a succession of pretty towns and villages. Here, away from the urban sprawls, you’ll see whales, bears and birds and more, in their natural habitat. And all across the province you’ll find delicious and award-winning food, which uses the best fresh, local produce.With so much prime, arable land, it’s no wonder Québec has a strong farm-to-table scene. You can follow the Flavour Trail in Charlevoix, north of Québec City, a 30-mile route stretching from Petite-Riviere-Saint-Francois to La Malbaie, encompassing cheesemakers, lavender-growers, apple orchards, breweries, and even an emu farm. Try some of the results of these delicious ingredients at the charmingly rustic Faux Bergers in Baie-Saint-Paul.On the south bank of the river, in the tiny waterside city of Rimouski, chef Colombe Saint-Pierre scours the St Lawrence River for bounty such as crayfish and lobster to cook in her restaurant, Chez Saint-Pierre. At the other end of the scale, the award-winning Toqué restaurant in Montreal places those regional ingredients at the centre of classic French-style cuisine, under the auspices of renowned chef Normand Laprise.Québec is big on microbreweries, too the province has over 150 of them, and celebrates beer with several festivals, from Québec City’s Festibiere, to the festival des Bieres de Laval. In Montreal, look out for quirky Dieu du Ciel! which sells 20 of its beers on tap, or Le Saint Bock, which has over 40 – it even makes poutine with beer.For wine-lovers, the Eastern Townships in south-eastern Québec province is the place to explore. Here, among picturesque rural towns and villages, you will find over 20 wineries, as well as some great restaurants using ingredients sourced from local rivers, lakes, forests and fields. Try Le Hatley at Manoir Hovey in North Hatley or, for a vegan option – with many ingredients grown in the back garden – Gaïa, in Bromont.As you might expect, a big city like Montreal is positively brimming with galleries, museums, and cultural experiences. The historic and the modern sit side by side – just yards away from the cobblestones of Old Montreal, for instance, is La Grande Roue, a 60-metre-high observation wheel that was opened in September 2017 to celebrate the city’s 375th birthday. From your cabin, you get great views across to Mount Royal hill. Also you can see Jacques Cartier Bridge, which, every evening, becomes an interactive, illuminated art piece called Living Connections. Social media users can dictate the patterns it forms using a Twitter hashtag.The city also uses light for Aura, an immersive, son et lumiere experience at the magnificent Notre Dame Cathedral. And you can learn more about Montreal’s history via Cité Mémoire, a series of projections on to historic or significant buildings around the Old Port, which tell the story of the city.To see all Montreal’s public art, pick up the public art map. You can create your own cultural walk – and get to know the city intimately at the same time.In Québec City, find out more about the region’s aboriginal people, and how the province came into being, at the striking Musée de la Civilisation or browse over 38,000 artworks at the Musée National des Beaux-Arts. There are also scores of beautiful churches to visit, such as the 300-year-old Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, with its 19th-century frescoes that tell the story of both the church and the city. Twenty miles up the St Lawrence River, you will find the ornate Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré and its recent addition – a striking 10-metre-high fountain of Saint Anne.Québec is primed for an outdoor lifestyle, its mix of mountains and rural farmland peppered with dense pine forests, steel-grey lakes, and emerald, patchwork fields. About 80 miles north-east of Montreal is Mont-Tremblant, one of the province’s main and most popular ski resorts. In winter, you can ski one of its 95 pistes, but you can also visit year-round for its golf courses and hiking trails.Whale watching around the St Lawrence River is incredibly popular belugas stay there year-round, and, during feeding season (May to October), you’ll also spot minkes, fin whales, and even humpbacks. You can see them in the Saguenay–St Lawrence marine park from three regions: Charlevoix (Tadoussac), Côte-Nord (Les Escoumins) or Bas-Saint-Laurent (Rimouski).If you prefer your creatures more furry, head to the Domaine le Pic-Bois, where you can observe black bears at close quarters. And if you just want to stretch your legs while taking in beautiful scenery, head to one of Québec’s national parks. Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier is just half an hour from Québec City, and has a spectacular glacial valley or you could visit parc national de la Gaspésie, where deer, moose and caribou roam.There’s plenty to do here all year round, and, unsurprisingly, Québec does winter very well. The bonus of snow means you can enjoy a range of sports and outdoor pursuits, from snowmobiling to skiing and snow-shoeing. You’ll also warm up pretty soon at the coldest music festival in the world, January’s Igloofest, and the Carnaval de Québec in February, with its parades, parties and outdoor sporting events.In spring, go cider-tasting on the Ile-aux-Coudres, an island in the St Lawrence River, or brave the zipline over the nearby Montmorency Falls, 30 metres higher than Niagara. For culture vultures, the festival TransAmériques in Montreal in late May and early June showcases three weeks of world-class drama and dance directed by top choreographers, artistic directors and playwrights.Summer’s the best time to stroll around cities and discover street art, or head to one of the big festivals in Montreal. Try the Jazz festival in June and July, Just for Laughs in July, or the Fringe festival in May and June.In Québec City, check out the festival d’Été de Québec, an 11-day music festival in July that attracts some of pop and rock’s biggest stars. Foodies should note First Fridays, where the biggest gathering of street food trucks in Québec pitch up at the Parc Olympique on the first Friday of every month, from May to October.Watch the foliage burst into colour in the autumn around Mont-Saint-Anne, and don’t miss the Great Color Adventure, a fall event featuring more than 145 km of cross-country and downhill mountain bike trails, and great hiking trails.Discover adventures all over Québec with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d8bf4197f0431930b5b940cead27b15ab6129a/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed11099b379fa115ffd7aa7b3c9ff5","title":"watch it or do it where to see and try canadas best sports","story":"Marathons, races, international contests … There’s much more to Canada’s sporting scene than the world’s best ice hockey.

The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn. Fun fact: members of the Flat Earth Society consider the island one of the four corners of the planet.Canadian Football: 106th Grey Cup – Edmonton, Alberta, 25 November 2018The biggest night of the Canadian Football season will take place this year in Edmonton, Alberta, with the 106th Grey Cup game. A five-day, fan-friendly festival precedes the big game, a Canadian tradition dating back to 1909. This Grey Cup game is outdoors, so if you can snag a ticket, be sure to bundle up ... and don’t forget your face-paint. Canadian football, with its unique quirks, is particularly popular in Western Canada where fans never sit on their hands, no matter how cold it gets. For your own taste of three-down fun, The Edmonton Sports and Social Club has an indoor Flag Football League that begins on 23 September and runs for five weeks. Perfect for all beginners, flag football is a great non-contact introduction to Canadian Football and friendly Edmontonians.World Junior Hockey Championships – Vancouver, British Columbia, 26 December 2018-5 January 2019The World Junior Hockey Tournament has become a favourite year-end tradition in Canada, as the best young hockey players on the planet take part in a two-week tournament that culminates in a must-watch gold medal game. This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival.

Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead. Located in the heart of the Grey Mountain trail network, this exciting course is approximately 12.5km long with 277m of elevation. In keeping with the laid-back nature of Canada’s North, the event is only as competitive as you want it to be.Gold Cup and Saucer Race – Charlottetown, PEI, August 2019Old Home Week – an annual celebration of all things agricultural and more related to Canada’s tiniest province – includes the largest street parade east of Montreal, and a one-of-a-kind harness-racing competition. This late-night horse race – where the horses don’t gallop, but move at a trot, and pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky – begins with the playing of the Island Hymn, followed by the Call to Post at exactly two minutes to midnight. And then, they’re off! If you’re not too exhausted from the previous night’s equestrian fun, there are a number of unique horseback riding opportunities for visitors along PEI’s red beaches and throughout its bucolic countryside. Try Brudenell Riding Stables, located 40 minutes outside Charlottetown on the island’s east coast.Helly Hansen Chester Race Week – Chester, Nova Scotia, August 2019The largest race of its kind in North America, The Helly Hansen Chester Race Week is an exciting, four-day, keelboat regatta that was first officially documented in 1856. Every August, more than 1,200 sailors set off from scenic Mahone Bay to compete in one of 15 fleets racing simultaneously on five different racecourses along the picturesque South Shore of Nova Scotia. Spectators can watch the races from the docks or inside the historic Chester Yacht Club. Once the boats are tied up, the party begins, with live music at the yacht club. For your own Nova Scotia sailing adventure, contact Star Charters in the nearby (and equally quaint) town of Lunenberg. Taking in a Nova Scotia sunset on the Eastern Star, their 48-foot tall ship, is an experience not to be forgotten.2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships – Regina, Saskatchewan, 27 August-1 September 2019Located in the heart of the sunny Saskatchewan capital, Lake Wascana will welcome thousands to the 2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships.

For clarity, I would like to emphasise that the pupils themselves were not involved in any wrongdoing.”While the departure of Penzer and the other staff members was upsetting, Head told parents, “the findings of the investigation are so serious that we were left with no choice – any school presented with this evidence would need to take the same action”.The Harris Federation said its investigation included interviews with staff and former pupils, and an analysis of every test paper.“As a result, three members of staff will not be returning to work at the academy. The evidence we were presented with was so serious that this was the only appropriate course of action,” the trust said in statement.“The Harris Federation will put in place all the support needed to enable the academy to move on from this incident positively and successfully.”The school has been in the national spotlight since 2012, when Michael Gove, the then education secretary, intervened to force the primary, then known as Downhills, into academy status and join the Harris chain, despite strong opposition from parents and the local authority.Since then, the school has regularly been praised for its achievements, including 2017 Sats results that appeared to show it performing well above the national average in writing and maths.The trust said it could not comment on the employment contracts of inidual staff members. Emma Penzer and the other members of staff who have left could not be reached for comment.The action comes after Department for Education figures showed a continued rise in maladministration of key stage 2 national tests in England, with the STA investigating 466 cases involving schools last year compared with 430 in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938bcd6ae5a918f00a0e918588db708c206dbdfd/0_247_3060_1835/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ba0d07e287de169ed458e32dfd0ae4","title":"meet the brighton resource goddess putting waste to good use","story":"Brighton and Hove’s first ever reuse manager, Cat Fletcher, says there’s nothing hippyish about repurposing second-hand scrapMany people think waste is smelly, rotten and useless. But Cat Fletcher, the self-styled “resource goddess”, doesn’t see it that way. In fact, she’s keen to get her hands on it. “To me there’s no such thing as waste – there’s just stuff in the wrong place,” she says. Fletcher, who runs several reuse programmes in Brighton and whose own home has “absolutely nothing new in it”, says we all need to reuse old things. And she says every business and council should employ someone like her to help them do it.Fletcher, 55, founded Freegle UK, where thousands of people give their old things away online. “It’s a lovely social activity,” she says. For example, if you’re giving away a tennis racquet you might meet someone else who plays tennis. She also built the award-winning Waste House, along with architect Duncan Baker-Brown, on the University of Brighton’s campus in 2014. The house is filled with repurposed rubbish, such as old duvets, cut-off jeans and CDs. And it looks surprisingly stylish, too.On top of that, Fletcher is the first reuse manager for Brighton and Hove city council, meaning she is called in during building renovations to sift through leftover scraps and redistribute them to local businesses and charities.The work is “never-ending” because there’s “too much stuff in the world”, Fletcher says. We throw away at least 3.5m tons of plastic and other solid waste a day, World Bank research shows. And the urgent need to better manage our waste was addressed last month by the Waste to Wealth summit, developed by the Prince of Wales.For Fletcher, waste has always been a passion. A former psychiatric nurse, she moved to the UK at the age of 29, after marrying a man from Brighton. When she arrived in Britain, Fletcher was “horrified” that there was no kerbside recycling. Taking matters into her own hands, she drove around in a van, picking up empty bottles and cans from her new friends and neighbours every week. “They thought I was this wacky girl from Australia,” she says. “But they indulged me.”As teenagers, her son and twin daughters found her love of waste annoying, but travelling changed their minds. “They’d be in paradise in Vietnam or somewhere and they saw these beautiful pristine landscapes covered in plastic,” she says.Attitudes towards waste have started to change. Last year, David Attenborough called for the world to cut back on its use of plastic in order to protect oceans. His Blue Planet series showed millions of viewers the horrific damage plastics are doing to marine wildlife.Fletcher is optimistic we can change our attitudes towards other rubbish, and get people to make better use of it. When the Waste House was first built four years ago people thought it was “a bit novel and a bit weird”, but now she thinks they are starting to get it.Despite the progress, there’s still much more we can do with our rubbish. “There’s only so many resources in the world and we’ve used so many of them already,” Fletcher says. “This isn’t about being a hippy. It’s logical – we need to reuse our stuff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

But more than 20,000 students around the world have now joined her. The school strikes have spread to at least 270 towns and cities in countries across the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the US and Japan.“For 25 years countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future,” she said. “I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.”“Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,” she said. “We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with. We have to make our voices heard.”The conference of nearly 200 nations is taking place in Katowice, Poland, and its main task is to turn the vision of tackling global warming agreed in Paris in 2015 into concrete action. On Monday, Sir David Attenborough told the summit that without action “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”.Thunberg, who had a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday, said: “What I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that we are facing an existential threat. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. First we have to realise this and then as fast as possible do something to stop the emissions and try to save what we can save.”On Tuesday, Guterres said: “Our younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition.”Toby Thorpe, a school student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in the recent school strikes in Australia and is also at the UN summit, said: “We are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up.” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, had dismissed the school strike – “the best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue” – but the Senate later approved a motion in support of the students.Thunberg said the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world was amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests was inspired by US school students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of school shootings. But initially her classmates refused to join in: “I had to do it alone.”She also had a message for other school students: “You don’t have to school strike, it’s your own choice. But why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.”Thunberg’s father, Svante, said: “As a parent you cannot support your child striking from school. I said to her you have to go out and do it for yourself.” But he added: “It’s OK in the holidays.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6077ffbd82ba44726ed6319c5fcdc0ebd884814/23_106_2438_1462/master/2438.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9096154a878755cdbf9c905cdfaae1a3 1000w","title":"prince musical hollywood","story":"Good luck to the execs tasked with making a jukebox singalong from songs laden with kink and taboo. But will cinema’s tedious mining of old material ever stop?With the news that a film based on the songs of Prince is in the works, Hollywood is about to write another enthralling chapter in the ongoing saga that sees it plunder any recognisable brand for a new movie. Reports have emerged that “Universal Pictures has picked up the rights to a number of classic songs that will form the basis of a fictional big-screen musical.” We go on to learn that producers and execs are aiming for “the style of Mamma Mia!”.The first aspect requiring examination here is the trend of film-makers and TV creatives ransacking existing IP – any dust-covered song or back catalogue or Wikipedia entry – in order to churn out something that stands a statistically better chance of turning a buck than an original story. Nobody could wholly blame failure-wary execs for plumping for output whose popularity is proven (Prince has sold more than a 100m records worldwide) – yet the prevailing trend for spinning old faves into new formats has something a little tiresome to it. In the last 10 days alone we’ve had news of a Great Gatsby prequel and of a Netflix series based on the work of Roald Dahl, “building out an imaginative story universe that expands far beyond the pages of the books”. The comparison with Dahl is an apt one, since it’s the writer’s heirs rather than the man himself who inked the deal. Prince was famously proprietorial towards his music: he consistently removed his songs from YouTube, forbade Spotify from playing them and didn’t even grant fair use to Weird Al Yankovic. Now his estate – consisting of his six siblings – finds itself in possession of this goldmine, and they seem to be a lot less reticent, so to the many cash-spinning releases since his death, we can now add a jukebox musical.It’s a genre that has traditionally had a rough time of it on screen. Mamma Mia! did the business at the box office but went down infamously badly with critics. (“The legal definition of torture has been much aired in recent years, and I take Mamma Mia! to be a useful contribution to that debate,” wrote the New Yorker’s Anthony Lane.) Other ventures include Julie Taymor’s Across the Universe, a flop based on the Beatles’ back catalogue, and Clint Eastwood’s Jersey Boys.Much of these confections’ horror lies in the sort of necessarily baggy story that can accommodate a great number of wildly different songs. The Queen stage musical, We Will Rock You, centred on Galileo and Scaramouche, two rebels who take on a villain called the Killer Queen in a mission that involves them going to the Seven Seas of Rhye. What, then, to expect of a Prince musical?Prince’s evocative and lascivious songs could tell any number of stories, but it’s probably fair to say the film won’t centre on Darling Nikki, the sex fiend whom the singer meets “masturbating with a magazine” in a hotel lobby. At best we might be granted a montage scene set to Gett Off, although 23 positions could be a lot to get through in four minutes. The point is that Prince’s music is daring, spiky and kinky, and it might be hard to tease out a coherent narrative from songs as different as Raspberry Beret and I Would Die 4 U. It’s also likely that the queer edges of Prince’s music might get blunted by this type of endeavour – although if the film features a take on When You Were Mine with a male-male-female threesome in it I will be the first to doff my cap.Whether Prince’s musical brilliance – which is of a different ilk to that of Abba or the Beatles – can be preserved in this film is another question entirely. In the meantime, anybody worried for the state of cinema can draw some gallows humour from the thought of a team of frazzled writers sweating their way through Prince’s songbook to sift out potential storylines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ec6359a2aeb4e7661ed621582f967a8be6efa5/57_133_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bbc59d1b37a41dd256c215aa6c72c15","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool everton","story":"Jürgen Klopp has been fined £8,000 after he accepted a Football Association misconduct charge for running on to the pitch in celebration of Divock Origi’s late winner in the Merseyside derby.Klopp raced towards Liverpool’s players, hugging the goalkeeper Alisson and was on Monday charged with misconduct by the FA.“I couldn’t avoid it obviously ... if there was no rule we as managers would do it every week,” Klopp said. “That’s what rules are for and if you break rules you have to be fined for it.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!There’s a fresh look about some of the big leagues around Europe right now. In Spain, Alavés and Sevilla sit above European champions Real Madrid, the pair right on a worried Barcelona’s shoulder. Bayern Munich’s traditional regal procession in the Bundesliga has been cancelled this year they’re miles off the pace set by Dortmund, have fewer points than a multinational soft beverage concern, and are even trailing Mönchengladbach for goodness sake, like it’s 1977 all over again. It looks like things may even get vaguely interesting in Scotland, for a while anyway, with Pope’s O’Rangers topping the table at this stage of the season for the first time since the taxman had a quick rifle through their desk drawers and performed an exaggerated double take accompanied by effects from the Hanna-Barbera sound library.A lot of fun to be had there, but sadly in England, everyone’s already resigned to Manchester City walking the Premier League. They’ll likely win the thing by an absurd margin again, even if by any normal standards, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham remain within striking distance with 24 matches still remaining. But Pep’s men look too damn good, and chances are the picture will look even clearer tonight after they stick six or seven past Watford while strolling about, yawning and scratching their arses. The only thing that could possibly stop them is an outbreak of knack, and to that end Sergio Agüero has suffered an abductor injury in training and will miss a couple of games. It’s a start, though City’s squad is so deep, it’ll require chronic long-term injuries to at least another 17 first-teamers, and for David Silva’s head to fall off, if we’re to get any sort of title race. And even then they could still field a decent side with Phil Foden in midfield and Ederson as rush goalie.Statistically it’s a long shot. Which might explain why José Mourinho appears to have given up the chase altogether. After his Manchester United team’s plucky draw at Southampton on Saturday evening, he had told some Brazilian TV channel or other that he would “try to win as many points as possible and try almost the miracle to end in fourth”. Today, ahead of the visit of Arsenal, he was asked to clarify whether his target for the 20-time English champions really was that modest. “If I used that word, it is not what I think at all. I don’t think we need a miracle. We need some players to perform.” And to further illustrate his star-scraping dreams and desires, he confidently asserted: “I don’t think Everton will be in front of United by the end of the season!” So, then: a miracle fourth place, maybe, but he reckons sixth is pretty much assured.

The this-is-not-who-I-am defence gets a lot of run-outs these days, as cameraphones catch non-racist people being racist on buses, non-homophobic people screaming abuse at gay people outside a nightclub, or any of the other variants that increasingly adorn the age. The point is: this is not who they are.Very occasionally, the person saying the thing is saying it on a stage, in front of a large audience and multiple television cameras, and is deploying remarks they have worked out in advance. But this, too, is not who those people are.By way of a recap, let’s journey to Monday night’s Ballon d’Or award ceremony in Paris. As presenter, Solveig was on stage when Lyon’s and Norway’s Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women’s Ballon d’Or. (Luka Modric picked up the men’s award, while Kylian Mbappé was honoured with a new under-21s prize, the Kopa Trophy.) Alas, no sooner had Hegerberg picked up the trophy than Solveig asked her if she could twerk. When she replied “no” and turned away from the podium, Solveig was shown laughing.I would say that he engaged in this skit for reasons best known to himself – except it seems Martin doesn’t actually know the reasons why he did this. Indeed, they are not even dimly grasped by him.The aforementioned reasons did appear known to Mbappé, who was shown in a cutaway shot wearing an expression we’ll call straight-to-GIF. And they were certainly known to Andy Murray, who promptly took to social media to declare: “Another example of the ridiculous sexism that still exists in sport. Why do women still have to put up with that shit? ... And to everyone who thinks people are overreacting and it was just a joke… It wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”For her part, Hegerberg got through it graciously, though wearing the unmistakable expression of a woman realising that it is somehow going to be on her to manage the situation in a way that causes as few ripples as possible. It won’t have been pleasant having to do this even at one of the very highest points of her professional career so far, but it certainly won’t have been unfamiliar. Not making dickheads feel like dickheads is one of the earliest ingrained lessons.As for Solveig, he has apologised “to anyone who may have been offended”, which as everyone knows is the boilerplate non-apology. He went on to say: “People who have followed me for 20 years know how respectful I am especially with women.”That “especially” is a bit of a tell. Why would you be any more respectful with women than with men, unless you thought there was something patronisably different about them? There was a classic Tom Cruise interview where the star was banging on about how he really respected women, and when the interviewer asked him what in particular he respected about them, he replied: “They smell good. They look pretty. I love them. I do.”Yup, “I especially respect women” is a close relative of “I love women” – that weirdo blanket statement embraced by men who prefer to homogenise everyone who shares the same pronoun. Guys, how can you love the entire classification “women”? Loads of women are horrendous, same as loads of men are. If you Google celebrities saying “I love women”, you always get some Mel Gibson interview from a couple of years after he called a female cop “sugartits”, or a Chris Brown interview from a few months after he was arrested for beating up his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. Or a Silvio Berlusconi interview from basically any time. Pro tip: guys in or out of the public eye who say: “I love women,” always turn out bad, or, more usually, have already done so.As for the organisers, they suggested a landmark had been reached with the first ever Ballon d’Or Féminin. But with a sexism controversy breaking out at the very moment of presentation, perhaps the real takeout is how far there is left to go.As predicted, the annual Sports Personality of the Year award row has rolled round again – a tradition as sacred as November’s Premier League poppy row, and as moving as the rows about why England players didn’t visit a first world war memorial when they had a game within 100 miles of it.Making an incredible comeback to the Spoty row is Tyson Fury, who last starred in one in 2015, when 130,000 signed a petition demanding he be removed from the shortlist. This year, the opposite sort of outrage is being worked up, with suggestions that because the panel of experts who decided the Spoty shortlist met in November, they will not have been able to take Fury’s sensational weekend draw against Deontay Wilder into account.According to the BBC’s published terms and conditions for Spoty: “The Panel have the right to amend elements of this or other awards … provided such changes remain within the spirit of the award.”So it’s only a matter of time before you spot your first “will of the people”, and people start demanding the BBC release the Spoty legal advice. All the worst timelines of public life are converging this December, and you should stockpile eggnog accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5378bebc1e58823604615797426fcc39f7e6667/152_1179_861_516/master/861.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=ed6b45d558efa288b529cb0faa868652","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2018","story":"Here are Nos 71 to 100 on the ’s list of best female players in the world.

The 60-year-old Finland-born conductor and composer has been with the London orchestra since 2008, when he took over from Christoph von Dohnányi. His successor – who has not yet been announced – will be only the sixth principal conductor in the orchestra’s 75-year history.“The Philharmonia is a group that juxtaposes world-class talent and star-power with an ease of musical communication, personal warmth, risk-taking and always good humour,” said Salonen. “I do not say lightly that they are family, and I am honoured to be a part of what will be their fantastic future.”Under his leadership, the orchestra has raised its profile and broadened its repertoire, excelling in early 20th-century music. It has also been at the forefront of imaginative and inclusive digital projects – its award-winning immersive installations, Re-Rite and Universe of Sound, gave audiences the opportunity to explore an orchestra section by section and experience music from a player’s point of view. More recently, virtual reality projects allowed those donning the goggles to get to the very heart of the orchestra and encounter symphonic music as if sitting under Salonen’s nose.’s classical critic Andrew Clements picked the Philharmonia’s Stravinsky series as one of his top musical events of 2016: “It stood out for its freshness and originality. Some of Stravinsky’s greatest and most neglected masterpieces were included, often in ingenious concert stagings, and if some of those did not work quite as convincingly as they might have done, the musical performances under Salonen were always of the highest quality.”“Salonen set very high standards for the orchestra,” said the ’s Martin Kettle. “He’s a terrific orchestral trainer and a brilliantly clear conductor in the Boulez tradition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

He is running scared of proper scrutiny, but we remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head-to-head.”If the ITV debate goes ahead, it is likely to take place at 7pm on Sunday night. This would disappoint viewers looking forward to a special celebrity edition of the The Chase gameshow featuring the athlete Jonnie Peacock and TV doctor Pixie McKenna, which is scheduled for that time slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741020f755cc5279a4fc7eee5a0fb27108d411f5/155_6_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25dd3024f669333f563c72d2c5943d9","title":"mps demand for brexit legal advice too vague says geoffrey cox","story":"Historic motion passes by 18 votes to find government in contempt of parliament• Latest Brexit news - live updatesTheresa May’s parliamentary authority has been thrown into further doubt after MPs passed a historic motion to hold the government in contempt over its failure to release the cabinet legal advice on the Brexit deal.The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, said the government would comply and publish the advice in full on Wednesday. The vote is an unprecedented move in recent political history and comes at the start of five days of debate leading up to the final vote on May’s Brexit deal next week.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, called the defeat “a badge of shame” and said the government “has lost its majority and the respect of the house”.The DUP, which the government relies on for a majority, had voted with Labour to hold the government in contempt, raising questions over whether May could still be said to command a majority.In the knife-edge vote, MPs decided by 311 votes to 293 to find the government in contempt of parliament, for failure to comply with a Commons motion in November that ordered it to release the advice in full.As Labour MPs heard they had defeated the government, a loud cheer went up, with one opposition backbencher shouting: “Beginning of the end!”The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had argued that the public interest did not permit the publication of the advice and instead published a summary of the advice and took questions in the House of Commons on Monday.During the debate, Starmer said the government was “wilfully refusing” to comply with a binding order to release the legal advice on its Brexit deal, putting it in contempt of parliament.The government had tried to dodge the contempt motion by putting down an amendment seeking to refer the matter to the Commons privileges committee, an attempt to kick it into the long grass. That was defeated by just four votes.Several rebellious Conservative MPs including the Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve expressed some discomfort with the government’s position, but said they would vote for Leadsom’s amendment. However, it was not enough to save the government from defeat by opposition parties and the DUP.During the debate, Starmer said Cox had “as good as admitted” he was ignoring a parliamentary vote to release the document, because he believed it was not in the national interest.“I’m sorry, that’s a plea of mitigation and not a defence,” Starmer said. “For the attorney general to say in his view that it is not in the national interest is not good enough,” he said.He quoted Rees-Mogg, who previously said it was “no longer a matter for this government to judge, it has been decided by this house, which is a higher authority”.Starmer said the government had decided not to oppose the original motion on releasing the advice in order to avoid the “short-term humiliation” of a defeat.“The decision taken not to oppose was a political decision because it feared it would lose the vote,” he said. “The price of that was higher than voting against the order … for months the government has ignored opposition day debates and now it has got them into very deep water indeed.”Earlier, Cox insisted he could not comply with MPs’ demand to release the full Brexit legal advice.In a letter to the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, released on Tuesday, Cox said the demand in the original motion was “extremely vague” and impossible for him to fulfil.In his letter, Cox said Bercow must urgently clarify what “possible consequences would follow if the motion was carried”. Cox said the summary provided to MPs in lieu of the full advice had his “oversight and approval”. He said his answers to MPs in the Commons chamber were as valid as his advice to cabinet.Bercow had declared on Monday night that there was “an arguable case that a contempt has been committed” after Labour and others complained that the summary released on Monday did not constitute the final and full advice provided to the cabinet.Starmer said it was of huge constitutional and political significance. “Never before has the House of Commons found ministers in contempt of parliament,” he said.“It is highly regrettable that the government has let it come to this, but ministers left the opposition with no option but to bring forward these proceedings.”Earlier, Theresa May had told cabinet it was a longstanding convention that “neither the fact nor the content of law officers’ advice is shared outside government without their consent”.Such is the government’s frustration at Tuesday’s wrangle, that Leadsom has written to the chair of the privileges committee, Kate Green, calling for an inquiry.Leadsom’s letter said the government feared Labour’s recent approach – which was used to force the government to publish economic assessments of Brexit, as well as in the current row – would “impact the ability of current and future governments to request and receive the best advice”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12fac43571c740a09d6e67bd3383aea0914220dc/0_103_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a6e555562f96026cf144325797a42209 1000w","title":"mps seek power to amend plan b brexit motion if may loses vote","story":"Dominic Grieve amendment aims at giving MPs more say over what happens if May deal rejectedBackbench MPs led by Dominic Grieve have inflicted a humiliating defeat on the government, in a bid to ensure parliament can seize control of what happens in the crucial days after Theresa May’s Brexit deal is voted on.While May was waiting to open five days of debate on her deal in the run-up to next week’s meaningful vote, MPs passed an amendment aimed at giving them more say over what happens next if she loses.Crossbench MPs led by Grieve had tabled an amendment to the parliamentary motion setting out how the government’s Brexit deal would be debated over the coming days. It passed by 321 votes to 299, despite leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, urging colleagues not to press the issue.The amendment marked an extraordinary third defeat for the government in a single day, after ministers had earlier failed to see off a motion finding them in contempt of parliament.With the prime minister’s challenge in winning next week’s vote looking all but insurmountable, MPs in the deeply ided House of Commons are increasingly concerned about what happens next.Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government will have 21 days to come back to parliament with a motion, setting out what it plans to do.Grieve’s amendment, which is backed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, is aimed at ensuring any such motion can be amended by MPs.They hope this will allow parliament to express its support for alternative approaches – and prevent the government either hurtling towards a no-deal Brexit without the backing of MPs, or imposing a plan B of its own devising.Defeat for the government looked all but certain all day, with more than a dozen Tory MPs publicly signed up to back the amendment, including Nick Boles, who is spearheading an attempt to promote a Norway-style Brexit deal.The Labour backbencher Chris Leslie, who backed the amendment, said: “MPs are going to gradually assert their rights – including the right to instruct the government in future stages. It was always a nonsense that MPs, after the ‘meaningful vote’, would be somehow gagged from expressing a view. The Grieve amendment gives teeth back to the House of Commons so MPs can have some real bite.”Grieve’s move was the latest in a series of procedural wrangles that have characterised the fraught process of shepherding May’s Brexit deal through a hung parliament.Supporters of a harder Brexit insisted they were relaxed about the amendment on Tuesday, saying that even if a motion was amended by MPs – to call for a second referendum, for example – it would not force the government’s hand.Former DexEU minister Steve Baker said, “whatever the outcome of the amendment, it is not legally binding on the PM”.However, Conservative whips may hope by opening up the prospect that parliament could push the government towards a softer Brexit, the amendment may convince a few Brexiters to throw their weight reluctantly behind May’s deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c4cdc81dce8e8e05030d0316994a422283f65/0_198_3901_2342/master/3901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f095612e70493faa839a6bf62d30dc0a","title":"norway option is worst of all brexit outcomes for uk say eu sources rules","story":"Britain told it would have to adhere to EU rules more strictly than NorwayThe UK would have to follow European Union rules more strictly than Norway, if MPs choose the Nordic model as a route out of Brexit deadlock, sources have said.Before next week’s crucial vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, MPs are being urged to consider an alternative that would keep the UK in the EU single market, through membership of the European Economic Area, the 31-country zone that covers EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Promoted by the Conservative former minister Nick Boles, the Norway-plus option also means joining the European Free Trade Area, which also includes Switzerland.The plan would help the UK minimise the economic impact of Brexit, but would also mean accepting EU rules on goods, services, people and capital, as well as competition and state aid.Senior officials say the UK would have to follow the relevant parts of the EU rulebook in full and would not be allowed to delay the adoption of laws, a cause of perennial tension between Brussels and EFTA countries. Given the size and proximity of the British economy, EU member states would regard the competition risks too great, according to one EU senior source, who added: “With the UK we cannot accept such a slippage.”The EEA agreement consists of 6,000 EU legal acts, up from 1,875 when the treaty came into force in 1994. About 500 EU laws are yet to be adopted by the four EFTA countries, including scores of banking regulations that the EU passed after the financial crisis. (Non-EEA Switzerland participates in the single market and has been accused of similar delays).Member states have always been observant to anything that tilts the playing field against their companies, said Lotta Nymann-Lindegren, a former negotiator for the EU on Brexit. “There is a large grey zone, where even with minor issues you can all of a sudden create a competitive advantage, so I think the balance of rights and obligations would be a very important thing.”Setting on the path towards a Norwegian-style status does not require any change in the Brexit 585-page withdrawal treaty or the non-binding political declaration, which leaves Briain’s options open. The EU would be ready to craft new language on EEA-EFTA membership to help the UK government, if necessary.Yet EU officials have long been sceptical about the UK choosing the Norway option, which curbs sovereignty. “Norway is the worst of all outcomes for the UK because that is Brexit in name only,” said the senior EU source.Norway also pays more per capita into the EU budget than the UK, raising questions about “substantially smaller” contributions promised. While the EEA does not cover agriculture or fisheries, existing EU red lines are unchanged, meaning if the UK wants tariff-free access for goods it will face demands that existing rights for EU fishing fleets are maintained.Joining the EEA also means accepting the free movement of people, the reddest of May’s red lines. Norway-plus advocates have seized on the “emergency brake“ in the EEA agreement, which allows a country to take unilateral measures in the event of “serious, economic or societal difficulty”.Many in the EU think British MPs have misunderstood the working of the brake, which is subject to consultation with other EEA countries and could lead to fines for misuse.“I’ve been a bit worried when I read about the marketing of this idea,” said Nymann-Lindegren, who used to participate in EU-EEA weekly meetings. While in theory the UK may be able to negotiate a new system, the current arrangement had limits, she said. “It is not designed for migration management on a regular basis, it is designed for extreme situations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa4932b08408fb2705a2e3e8bd20e9874337fb7/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e742d243fd1cca2b215d3139b4453d8a","title":"what happens next if theresa mays brexit deal is voted down","story":"We examine the possible scenarios, from a snap election to a second referendumAfter taking her Brexit deal on a round-Britain roadshow last week, Theresa May is spending much of the next few days holding face-to-face meetings with her MPs in an attempt to persuade them to support it in the meaningful vote on 11 December.But with the parliamentary arithmetic looking bleak, just about everyone in Westminster is busy looking beyond next Tuesday – and puzzling over what will happen next.If the deal is voted down as anticipated, there are at least seven possible scenarios:While no one in Downing Street wants to countenance it openly, the EU Withdrawal Act – as amended by MPs – gives Theresa May up to 21 days to return to parliament and set out what she plans to do next.She could come back to parliament and say she will seek to renegotiate the backstop – though No 10 insists that would be impossible – or even pivot towards a different kind of Brexit, perhaps with a permanent customs union as Labour is calling for.May could also ask for an extension to article 50, the strictly time-limited EU exit procedure, in order to allow her to renegotiate, though that would require the consent of all 27 other EU member states.Rumours have been swirling around Westminster for several weeks now, suggesting Downing Street could choose to take a dramatic gamble and appeal to the public, over the heads of squabbling MPs, to back the prime minister’s deal.Of course, it did not go too well the last time she asked voters to give her a fresh Brexit mandate, last year, but internal polling suggests there is considerable personal sympathy for the embattled prime minister. If she won, she could press ahead with her deal.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, she would need a two-thirds majority to trigger a general election, but last year’s experience suggested that is not an insurmountable barrier – and Labour is champing at the bit.Parliament must be dissolved at least 25 working days before a general election can be held, so any election would probably take place in late January.The prime minister has been so intimately associated with the shape of this Brexit deal, with its focus on controlling migration and extricating Britain from the scope of the European court of justice, that a heavy defeat could fatally undermine her already dented authority.Particularly if the defeat is a hefty one, she may decide she cannot be the person to make the next move – or her cabinet may decide for her.The Conservatives would then need to hold a hasty leadership contest, the outcome of which could have a profound impact on the shape of Brexit.If May opts to try to cling to office after a thumping defeat in the meaningful vote – and her cabinet does not show her the door by threatening to resign en masse – she could face a vote of no confidence in her leadership.The European Research Group of Brexiters failed to muster the 48 names necessary to trigger such a vote last month, but following a defeat, particularly if May appears unwilling to change course, many more could decide to join them.Losing the vote would prompt a leadership contest, in which May could not stand, and her successor would face the job of resurrecting Brexit with the 29 March deadline fast approaching.Labour’s priority is to try to secure a general election, to allow Jeremy Corbyn to take over and send Sir Keir Starmer to negotiate with Brussels.In the days following the vote, Labour could table a vote of no confidence in the government. May could still win it, but not without the support of the DUP, which is deeply dissatisfied with her approach to Brexit.If the government loses, Corbyn would have a fortnight in which to try to assemble a viable governing majority, by teaming up with other parties. If he was unable to do so – which would appear likely – a general election would be called.Another outlandish possibility being mooted by some at Westminster is that a time-limited, cross-party “government of national unity” could emerge at this point, perhaps around the idea of a Norway-style Brexit.Dominic Grieve and his allies have fought to ensure that whichever motion is brought back to parliament by the government, once the vote has failed, can be amended.In theory at least, that could allow MPs to test the backing of MPs for a menu of different options, including a harder or a softer Brexit.Even if a majority emerged for an alternative approach, it is unclear whether such a motion would be formally binding on the government. But proponents of this approach argue that it would have political bite, as a statement of the collective will of the House of Commons.Rebel MPs who support a “people’s vote” are determined to try to use any parliamentary tactics they can to force the government to take its Brexit deal to the public in another referendum.Crucially, while several on the Labour frontbench remain deeply sceptical about the idea, its membership is overwhelmingly in favour of overturning Brexit, and leading figures including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have begun to make warmer noises about it.It remains unclear whether there is time for a referendum to be held before the March deadline and an extension of article 50 would probably be necessary.But if parliament appears deadlocked, passing the question back to the public could look increasingly appealing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16aa50e899f1a60db52aacc1d49743a7eb020f9/0_1024_1632_978/master/1632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c500f438a2c4b294cf05d324c951e0a","title":"skeletons found in london archaeology dig reveal noxious environs","story":"The discoveries were made at a 19th-century burial site at New Covent Garden marketNews reports and social media anxiety may make us feel that life is tough in Britain today but the extraordinary findings of a new archaeological excavation have provided a salutary reminder that, a couple of centuries ago, it was so much worse.Archaeologists who worked on an early 19th-century burial site at the New Covent Garden market in south-west London where about 100 bodies were found have said that they contain evidence of arduous working conditions, a noxious environment, endemic diseases, physical deformities, malnutrition and deadly violence.The burials offer an extraordinary glimpse into life in early industrial London, between the 1830s and 1850s. They show the harshness of life for the industrial poor that Charles Dickens described so acutely in his classic novels.The skeletal remains of those who might have been Dickens’ subjects, who could be deemed among the first “modern” Londoners, have been uncovered by Wessex Archaeology during the excavation of part of a cemetery originally situated on the site of New Covent Garden market in Nine Elms.The cemetery was attached to the church of St George the Martyr. The site had been partially cleared in the 1960s, just before the new market was built, having relocated from its original setting in central London.Kirsten Egging Dinwiddy, senior osteoarchaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, told the  these were people who had led “a life of drudgery and just-about surviving”.She added: “The surrounding assortment of noxious, dangerous and labour-intensive industries would have made for very poor working and living conditions, although great numbers of people continued to flock to the area to take advantage of work opportunities. Most of those trying to survive in and around the area would have been classed as poor or very poor.”The burials reveal high levels of chronic infections, including endemic syphilis.Three burials in particular offer fascinating insights. One of them reveals a woman who had suffered lifelong congenital syphilis and had led a strenuous working life that involved heavy use of her upper arms and shoulders.She had a broken nose and a wound to her skull, suggesting she had been murdered. Archaeologists believe that she was attacked, probably from behind, stabbed in the right ear with a thin blade, like a stiletto dagger.In another burial, a man who was once nearly six feet tall was found. He would have had a distinctive look. A flattened nose and a depression on his left brow suggest “several violent altercations”, the archaeologists say. Bare-knuckle fighting was a popular pastime – he died before the adoption of Queensberry Rules that required boxing gloves – and his knuckles show signs of such fights.Egging Dinwiddy said that “he would have had a less-than-winning smile” as both front teeth had been lost, probably due to an enormous cyst on the roof of his mouth. He also suffered from syphilis.One of burials has added poignancy because it has a coffin plate revealing the name of Jane Clara Jay, who died on 18 March 1847, just before her second birthday.She was the daughter of Sarah Jay and her labourer husband, George James Jay, of Nine Elms. Archaeologists found signs of underlying malnutrition, but the exact cause of her death is unclear.New Covent Garden market is the UK’s largest fresh-produce market. Its 175 businesses employ more than 2,500 people. In partnership with Vinci St Modwen, it is undergoing a major redevelopment with new buildings and facilities.Archaeologists were taken aback by the sheer number of burials beneath what was a car park. They thought that the site of the original cemetery had been completely cleared in the 1960s.Finds from the New Covent Garden project will be shown as part of Digging for Britain on BBC Four at 9pm on Wednesday.

It wants the country to pay its substantial costs, including legal costs, incurred from dealing with the Russian doping crisis.“This debt must be settled,” said Rune Andersen, who heads the IAAF taskforce dealing with Russia. While Russia has promised to pay, “We need to receive the money.”The IAAF also is pressuring for its anti-doping unit to get access to data and drug-test samples from a Moscow laboratory that could help identify more Russian athletes suspected of doping.“Russian athletes cannot return to international competition unconditionally until that such issue is resolved one way or another,” he said.The lab data could reach the IAAF via the Wada, which has set a year-end deadline to receive it. Track and field’s anti-doping unit would then have to analyse the information to satisfy the IAAF that it “hasn’t been tampered with,” Andersen said.Unclear was how long all this might take. IAAF President Sebastian Coe noted the next IAAF council meeting is scheduled for March. The world championships open in Doha in late September.In a statement, Russian Athletics Federation president Dmitry Shlyakhtin said “regulating our debts financially requires a lot of work and in-depth consideration. We need to draw up various legal documents and discuss the payment arrangements. We’re also talking with the IAAF about possibly paying in instalments over six months.”He also said providing Wada with access to the Moscow laboratory samples “will obviously take some time, we recognize that.”The IAAF has allowed dozens of leading Russians to compete as neutrals if they can show an extensive history of passing drug tests. These include athletes such as Maria Lasitskene, who next year will look to defend the high jump world title she won in 2017.The IAAF also announced that Budapest will host the 2023 world championships, after Doha next year and Eugene, Oregon, in 2021. The decision was expected because the IAAF had already said the Hungarian capital was its preferred choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcafb31972aced2de66089d691e1a972d1cd1d8/0_0_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a43b37f1b655bc9958dac8deca58ef4","title":"apple macbook air review the new default mac","story":"A beautiful, crisp display, good performance and modern ports rejuvenate a classicApple has finally given the MacBook Air the update fans have been craving for the last three years: new processors and a vastly improved Retina display. But is this the new Mac laptop for most people or has it lost some of the desirability and shine while stagnating since 2015?When closed, the new MacBook Air looks pretty much the same as the old one. The aluminium frame is still wedge-shaped. It still has the cut-out in the deck to lift the screen and still has the Apple logo emblazoned on the lid, even if it is now metallic and shiny rather than being light-up opaque plastic.But side by side it is clear this is a smaller, more modern Mac shrunk in both width and length, but not in height, fitting exactly into the footprint of the current 13in MacBook Pro. Gone, too, are the old selection of ports from the Air, reduced to only two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one headphone socket. USB-C is the industry standard port of the moment, with Thunderbolt 3 adding much greater capacity and future proofing, but the lack of an SD card reader is disappointing.Open it up and essentially what you are looking at is the screen and deck of a MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Gone are the large grey bezels around the 13.3in screen from the Air, replaced with thinner black borders as used on other Apple laptops.The MacBook Air has Apple’s third-generation butterfly keyboard, a large force-touch trackpad and speakers drilled into either side. In the top right is the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is noticeably faster than Apple’s previous iterations, but instead of a Touch Bar you have regular F keys. While the Touch Bar can be useful, many don’t like it and most will probably be happy the MacBook Air does not have it.Some will love the keyboard, some will hate it because it is still pretty clicky with minimal key travel. It isn’t my favourite keyboard on a laptop but it is crisp and responsive and I have no problem typing for long periods of time on it. Everyone should love the trackpad, however, which is the best in the business. It is big, smooth, responsive and totally solid, despite the feeling of motion when you push down on it provided by the Taptic Engine haptic motor below it.Build quality is top notch, with no noticeable give or flex in any part of the machine. Weighing 1.25kg, the Air is about the same as rivals such as Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 and is slim enough that you don’t really notice it in a backpack. But it is noticeably heavier than the 921g 12in MacBook or 770g Surface Pro 6 (1.08kg with keyboard attached). At its thickest part it is also 0.7mm thicker than the MacBook Pro.The MacBook Air as tested had 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The MacBook Air has a relatively unusual mix of hardware for 2018. It only has one choice of processor, an eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but it isn’t the same quad-core U-series processor available in the 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, instead it is a dual-core Y-series chip.While the fine points of processor names are probably lost on most Mac buyers, Y-series chips are lower power in performance and energy consumption than their U-series siblings. For the MacBook Air, Apple has mixed things up a little – most computers that use Y-series chips are fanless, but the MacBook Air has a small fan, which means it should maintain performance for longer by better dissipating heat. Not that I ever heard the fan in day-to-day use, unlike the old MacBook Air.Performance is very similarly to a dual-core 2017 MacBook Pro, falling down only in intensive multiprocess tasks, where both laptops are far behind the 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar partly because it has a quad-core processor.With a fast SSD and RAM, therefore, the MacBook Air feels snappy in all tasks and will easily handle most day-to-day activities. It was a pleasure to use. Only if you attempt to do something graphically or arithmetically challenging, such as attempting to play the latest game, edit multiple 4K videos or mine cryptocurrency, will you find the MacBook Air struggles.The MacBook Air is capable of seeing out a work day without having to be plugged in, lasting about nine hours between charges. That was with the brightness set about two-thirds, 20 or so tabs open in Chrome, iA Writer, Reeder and various chat apps in constant use, while listing to Spotify over Bluetooth headphones for four hours. More conservative use should mean about 10 hours of productivity but it won’t come close to the 14 or so hours some managed to squeeze out of the previous MacBook Air.MacOS hasn’t radically changed in years, iterating small elements of the interface with each update, while improving the performance of the underlying system. Now at version 10.14 Mojave, the biggest visual change is the introduction of a dark mode to the interface, which is meant to be for concentrating at night or similar, but I found it a nice change and left it on all the time.Mojave also brought some of Apple’s iOS apps to the Mac, including Apple News and Voice Memos. For the most part you cannot tell that the app is a port of sorts of an iOS app. The Apple News app works more or less as any regular Mac app would, but with fewer features and options than you might be used to on macOS, and the same goes for Voice Memos, which syncs with the Voice Memos app on iOS.MacOS is a mature and stable operating system that anyone who has used Windows 10 or most versions of Linux will be able to adjust to relatively easily.The Apple MacBook Air is available in silver, space grey and gold costing £1,199 with a dual-core Intel Core i5 Y-series processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £1,399 with 256GB of storage.Options are available with up to 16GB of RAM for an extra £180, 512GB of storage for £400 and 1.5TB of storage for £1,200, reaching a maximum price of £2,579.In many ways the original MacBook Air became the default Mac for most people. It was a highly capable machine that didn’t cost the earth (for an Apple product).The new MacBook Air lives up to most of the standards set by its predecessor. It is highly capable machine that will handle the majority of what most people need to get done. It’s not an exciting or ground-breaking computer but it is the new workhorse for all those who don’t need serious graphical or processing performance but must use a Mac.However, since the last version of the MacBook Air launched in 2015, competition in the sub-£1,300 premium laptop category has increased dramatically. With strong options from Dell, Microsoft and many others that are often cheaper and more powerful than the new MacBook Air, if you aren’t tied into MacOS there are arguably better options.For those Apple buyers who have been lost in the gap between the tiny 12in MacBook and the costly 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the new MacBook Air delivers. In fact, I would say the MacBook Air is the new default Mac – and not only because it’s the cheapest. It is arguably the most balanced and, therefore, best Apple laptop currently available.Cons: expensive, no SD card reader, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, only a 30W charger in the box, butterfly keyboard has had problems with longevity in previous versions This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Now a small army of volunteers are seeking to recover thousands of public rights of way before they disappear for everPaul Howland is standing in a bed of nettles, his head surrounded by a halo of dusky blue sloes. Behind him is an impenetrable tangle of undergrowth, self-seeded trees and what looks like the long-discarded parts of an a vehicle.“The old path went up here,” he says, waving his walking pole further into the thicket. “I first spotted it on Milne’s county map of Hampshire from 1791.”Howland emerges from the nettles and shows me an image on his phone which confirms his suspicions: we have just found one of Britain’s missing footpaths.“This is Greenwood’s 1826 county map and you can see the path. It was called the Markway and goes straight up to this line – now the A30 road. But compare that with the current Ordnance Survey map.” He unfolds a paper map and points to our position.“Instead of going straight, the footpath turns hard left at this point and heads back towards Andover. What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way – and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland’s work a renewed sense of urgency.“It sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we’d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.”As a walker, I reflect, I’m used to losing my way. It’s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too.Howland chuckles. “It’s easier than you think.”If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.You can get in touch by filling in this encrypted form.Your responses will only be seen by the  and we’ll be in touch if we are considering your response as part of our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.We give up any attempt to force a way through the bushes and set off up the path to the left. Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don’t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal.“Some parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.” Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat.Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. “In my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent – mostly from new buildings and roads.”“Those missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.”“These are ancient rights of way,” Cornish adds. “Rights built up over centuries. And it’s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.”We reach a sign – “Private road, access only” – and ignore it. “It’s a public bridleway,” says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again.Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers’ path where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone’s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change.He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. “The public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,” says Howland. “But getting there is harder.”He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these “permissive” paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don’t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and “private property” signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way.“There are two ways to recover a lost path,” Cornish says. “By proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.” What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear?“Almost by accident.” Howland says. “In the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.” If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared.We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub.Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. “It does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don’t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.”The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire’s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. “We expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.”The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation.Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. “It’s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.” In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it.“A restored right of way will usually last for ever.” He smiles. “There aren’t many tasks in life that you can say that about.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The talks are taking place against a backdrop of continued fighting.Iranian-backed Houthi fighters seized control of the capital, Sana’a, in March 2015 in protest at rising oil prices, ousting the UN recognised Hadi government. Supported militarily by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Hadi government has been fighting to win back control of the country, leading to mass famine and tens of thousands of civilian deaths.Griffiths is trying to learn the lessons of the previous failed talks in September, when Houthi negotiators felt unable to travel to Geneva after undertakings about wounded soldiers and the return of the negotiators to Yemen at the end of the talks were not met.Partly by staying physically close to the Houthis, Griffiths appears to have made more progress with the often ided group than any previous UN mediator.The Houthi team and Griffiths left on a plane chartered by Kuwait, one of the Middle East’s mediator countries, on Tuesday.The Hadi government’s team will follow the Houthis, reversing the choreography of Geneva where Hadi’s team was left waiting for the Houthis to arrive.In the first step of a tortuous process the Hadi government on Monday allowed 50 Houthi fighters to fly to Oman for treatment accompanied by doctors.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the transfer of the wounded fighters was “the essential precondition for the talks”.The deal on prisoner swaps would cover between 1,500 and 2,000 members of the pro-government forces and between 1,000 and 1,500 rebels, according to a government official, Hadi Haig.The ICRC will identify the iniduals to be released, and the modalities of the release.Pressure was also being applied on Hadi’s government to pay the salaries of civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas, and to allow the opening of the international airport at Sana’a.Hadi himself has been an exiled leader, often in Riyadh and recently in the US. He is not held in high regard by the Emiratis, and the government delegation will be led by the Yemeni foreign minister, Khaled Alyemany.The Yemeni government has increasingly relied on Washington’s belief that Iranians have been using Yemen as a base to attack Saudi Arabia, but US senators are putting unexpectedly strong pressure on the Trump administration to end US support for the war.David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee humanitarian organisation, and one of the international figures watching the Yemen crisis most closely, urged the US to keep pressure on Saudi Arabia to negotiate.“We call on the US and UK, as military supporters to the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition in Yemen, to use their influence to encourage meaningful dialogue in these talks and ensure the result is a reduction in violence, improved humanitarian and commercial access around the country… and salary payments to public sector workers,” he said.Anwar Gargash, the United Arab Emirates foreign affairs minister, said the Sweden talks were a “critical opportunity” to find a political resolution. “A sustainable Yemeni-led political solution offers the best chance to ending the current crisis. A stable state, important for the region, cannot coexist with unlawful militias,” he said.The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Lowcock, freshly back from Yemen, said the country will need billions next year and predicted the talks would not be a fast process.Hunt has also disclosed UK plans to hold a vote on a new UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Yemen have been delayed until after the peace talks have concluded.Pressed by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, Hunt conceded the UK had to make compromises on the draft text of the UN resolution. “I can confirm both the original text, and the current text, refers to international humanitarian law, but in the process of getting that text agreed, did we make compromises to the Saudis, did we make compromises to the Houthis? Yes, we did, and as a result of this diplomacy, talks are happening this week.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710895.1543241795!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what s pushing teachers buttons","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecondary school teachers are trained through a two-year postgraduate masters in education, meaning most will have to spend six years at college. Photograph: iStock Even the best schools, teachers and principals have problems that are outside their control. Schools don’t operate in a vacuum: education is highly political and schools are impacted by fluctuations in funding, cutbacks and the availability of teachers. We took a look at some of the wider issues in education and what’s pushing the buttons of teachers.Teachers are becoming increasingly difficult to recruit for a number of second-level subjects, particularly maths, science, technology, home economics, Irish and modern languages. As revealed by  education editor Carl O’Brien in January, the number of applications to second-level teacher training courses in the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland (UCD, UCC, NUI Galway and Maynooth University) has dropped from 2,821 in 2011 to 1,068 in 2017, although the Department of Education says the number of graduates has remained reasonably steady. Whereas primary school teachers are trained through an undergraduate degree, secondary teachers are trained through a two-year postgraduate masters in education, meaning most will have to spend six years at college. Until 2014, this was a one-year degree postgraduate degree qualification.This may be one factor in the decline, but the cost of the course – between €10,000 and €15,000 – is likely to be another. Where teachers do graduate, Irish schools are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with schools in the Middle East, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which offer either significantly higher wages and the chance to save a deposit for a house and pay a decent portion of it upfront, the chance of adventure and an excellent standard of living in a warmer climate, or both. John MacGabhann, general secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI), says teachers can now find better career options in parts of the private sector. “In home economics, they can find well-established, good, permanent employment in the agri-food sector and elsewhere. Science teachers are being recruited into the tech and science industries. Modern language teachers are being sought by the same industries and there is a dearth of Irish teachers at a time when the demand for education through the medium of Irish is continuing to rise. And technology teachers can find good opportunities in the building and design industries.”After the 2018 teacher union conferences, the Government entered into talks with the three teacher unions on the issue of pay inequality. During the last recession, a two-tier payscale emerged which saw teachers appointed after 2011 paid less than their colleagues for the same job. The issue has been incendiary ever since and led to a lot of bitterness and anger among those on a lower salary. Through negotiations, that pay gap has now closed from 27 per cent to 8 per cent. MacGabhann says this is about more than justice, equality and fairness. “Yes, teachers are charged with inculcating those values when they are being treated unjustly, inequitably and unfairly. But the impact has been that people have been less attracted to the teaching profession than they may have been otherwise. We’re not getting the same proportion of graduates attracted to teaching, and we’re losing a portion of those who do come in because they’re finding they don’t have a sustainable income from teaching. Teachers have always had a sense of vocation, but they also have to concern themselves with how they can live.”“The Government has abjectly failed to regulate the market in a fair manner,” says MacGabhann. “They have excessively relied on the private market to deliver homes. The rental crisis and their failure to engage in a housing programme that could be delivered by local authorities is particularly bad in Dublin, but it’s not confined to the capital. Young people can’t buy a home. With that, the belief that teaching is a well-respected and reasonably paid career that is valued by Government and, by extension, society, is taking a pounding.” “A second-level teacher might not commence employment until the age of 26,” says MacGabhann. “They’re doing six years of unpaid study in the midst of a teacher supply crisis, during a time when salaries fell, promotional opportunities have diminished and casualisation of the workforce has become more common.”Teachers are increasingly concerned about “initiative overload”, says Moira Leydon, assistant general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI). “While many of these are designed to complement and link in with other initiatives – such as the new junior cycle curriculum tying in with the numeracy and literacy strategies – teachers don’t necessarily experience the changes as complementary. Instead, the pervading sense is that one ministerial project follows another in quick succession. It can feel like a rolling tide, in the context of schools having suffered guidance and other cuts during the austerity years.”Leydon says morale has suffered and teachers feel there is too much bureaucracy. “Teachers feel that, if society coughs, schools are expected to develop the vaccine. There’s a lot more pressure on schools these days to be active in the formation and socialisation of young people but they are not receiving the professional supports to enable them to perform this role.”“Schools have long since recognised their overarching obligations to society,” says MacGabhann. “They look after the children of a community and it is very serious and precious responsibility. But we can’t expect schools to have the panacea for all society’s ills. Parents don’t necessarily expect it, but the ramping up of expectation has come by way of additional regulatory demands, and an explosion in workload without the compensating time being given for staff resources.”MacGabhann says it perfectly legitimate and right that schools are inclusive of young people with special needs but that the ancillary services needed to support this, such as speech therapists, are not available at the level needed. “Resource us and we can do all of this.”Class sizes are often discussed at primary level, where there is currently an average of one teacher for every 26 pupils, although some schools still report larger class sizes. At second-level, the issue is more complicated because, as well as being influenced by the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) – currently set at 19:1 – it’s also impacted by factors such as time-tabling and the demandsamong students for certain subjects. David Duffy, education and research officer with the TUI, says even though there is one teacher provided for 19 students, “it does not mean that there are only 19 students in every class group as this allocation has to cover the full breadth of subject options across the curriculum and the significant, varied requirements of managing a large school community”.There is no up-to-date data on class sizes at second-level, but Gemma Tuffy of the ASTI says that in 2007, when the teacher allocation was 18:1, the union conducted research on class size which found that 64 per cent of third-year students were in classes of 25 or more students, while a further 16 per cent found themselves in classes of 30 or more. In the same survey, 90 per cent of teachers agreed that large classes affected their ability to give inidual attention to students.“Since then, the teacher allocation has disimproved,” says Tuffy. “This has led to larger classes. In addition, the mainstreaming of students with special education needs, who typically amount to between 18.5-20 per cent of the student population, has significantly added to the complexity of classroom teaching. In today’s classroom, the curriculum focus is increasingly on active learning methodologies, teamwork, presentations and skills development. In this context, large class size can be inhibiting and impact on the amount of non-teaching work undertaken by teachers, including marking homework and preparing laboratories.”Duffy says the addition of new subjects, including computer science and physical education for exam purposes, will require the PTR to be lowered. However, he points out the current problems in recruiting and retaining teachers could cause the PTR to worsen despite the best intentions of policy-makers to increase it."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

File photograph: PAPeople are being breathalysed for drink-driving going to and from Mass because the law is being enforced so strictly, Independent TD Danny Healy-Rae has claimed.The Kerry TD, who vehemently opposed legislation imposing an automatic ban for a first drink-driving offence, accused the Government of attempting to close churches as well as post offices and most services for rural towns and villages.But Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told him drink driving laws were aimed at saving lives and there was a higher risk of road deaths in rural Ireland.At one time 600 to 700 people died on the roads each year but that had now been reduced to under 200, which was still 200 too many lives lost, he said.“That’s the purpose of the road traffic legislation. It’s not to discommode people - it’s not to make their lives harder to lead. It’s to make the roads safer,” Mr Varadkar added.Mr Healy-Rae claimed that “the social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens”.People were angry because they were isolated from company and conversation because of the legislation, which meant they could no longer enjoy just two pints of beer.“People are being checked going to mass, they’re being checked coming from mass. And I’m not blaming the gardaí, or indeed I’m not blaming inidual superintendents, because it’s across different isions and it’s across county boundaries,” Mr Healy Rae said.He asked if the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan or Minister for Transport Shane Ross had ordered the checkpoints, because they wanted the stricter law.“Is it the way ye want to close the churches now as well as the post offices. Ye’ve mostly everything else closed. I suppose ye want to close the churches as well now in rural Ireland,” Mr Healy Rae said. He said bars were deserted and many were now closing and so were nearby businesses.He asked where the promised rural link buses were, the ones that were to be provided with the implementation of the changes to the law, which he said had been announced during the summer.Many parts of Dublin and other urban areas had a wide variety of transport options available. But people were left isolated in parts of south and east Kerry included Glencar, Beaufort, Waterville and Black Valley as well as Currow, Scartaglen and Gneeveguilla. The Taoiseach said checkpoints were not a matter for government but for senior gardaí and they were also set up in urban areas and were not limited to rural locations.But checkpoints aimed to ensure people did not drive with drink or drugs taken.Gardaí were also checking for tax and insurance, and to catch or deter criminals, Mr Varadkar said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3719489.1543917199!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit britain can revoke article 50 without eu approval ecj adviser says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPro-European Union (EU), anti-Brexit demonstrators wave Union and EU flags as they protest opposite the Houses of Parliament in London on December 3, 2018. Photograph: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVASAFPGetty ImagesBritain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice from the European Union, an adviser to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said on Tuesday, before a landmark ruling in the coming weeks.The non-binding opinion for the ECJ comes as the British parliament begins five days of debate on prime minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal with the EU before voting on it next Tuesday.“Advocate General (Manuel) Campos Sanchez-Bordona proposes that the Court of Justice should declare that Article 50 ... allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU,” the ECJ said.“That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded,” it said in a statement, meaning Britain would have to notify the EU that it has changed its mind before Brexit day, on March 29th, 2019.“The Advocate General emphasises that withdrawal from an international treaty, which is the reverse of treaty-making power, is by definition a unilateral act of a state party and a manifestation of its sovereignty,” the court also said.“A member state which decides to withdraw is to notify the European Council of ‘its intention’ - and not of its decision - to withdraw, and such an intention may change,” it added. “It would be illogical to force that member state to withdraw from the EU in order to then have to negotiate its accession.”The court, which tends to follow the advocate general’s opinion in its final decisions, did not give an exact date for the ruling but it is expected in the coming weeks.Ms May has agreed an exit pact and an outline of future EU-UK ties with the other 27 states staying on together after Brexit. But the proposed accord still needs the endorsement of the British parliament, where it faces stiff opposition.The other EU states, as well as the European Commission, want any revocation of Britain’s withdrawal notice to require the consent of the bloc, fearing that, otherwise, Britain or other would be leavers could use this tactic to win concessions.Tuesday’s opinion rejects that argument but says that “good faith and sincere cooperation must also be observed” in any withdrawal of the exit notice.The case was brought before the ECJ by Scottish politicians opposed to Brexit. They hope it could pave the way for a potential second Brexit referendum, giving voters the option to remain in the EU.“That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives,” said Jo Maugham, one of the lawyers involved in the case.Both May and the EU have said that, if the British parliament votes this offer down, Britain would risk crashing out of the bloc with no deal in place to mitigate the damage. May says it would risk not delivering the Brexit that the British people voted for.But the tentative deal is also opposed by advocates of a sharp break from the EU and she is struggling to get enough backing for it, even within her own party.“Every effort is being made on both sides of the Channel to stop Brexit,” prominent ‘Leave’ campaigner Nigel Farage said after the ECJ statement. Theresa May will on Tuesday appeal to MPs to back her Brexit deal at the start of five days of debate on the agreement, which is opposed by much of her own party as well as by the opposition. The prime minister will say that the deal respects the outcome of the 2016 referendum and will return to Britain control of its borders, laws and money.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted. This is the deal that delivers for the British people,” she is expected to say.John Bercow, the Speaker, allowed Labour, the DUP and four other opposition parties to lay down a motion that will be voted on Tuesday, immediately before before the start of the five-day debate on the Brexit dealThe motion, submitted late on Monday, calls on MPs to find “ministers in contempt for their failure to comply” and is signed by the shadow Brexitsecretary, Sir Keir Starmer the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds and the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs on Monday that Britain would have to remain indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop if negotiations failed to produce a free-trade deal that kept the Border open. Mr Cox was speaking after the publication of an overview of his legal advice to the government on Brexit, which followed a demand by MPs that they should see his full advice to the cabinet.“I make no bones about it, I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination of this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations have irretrievably broken down. But I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently,” Mr Cox said.The attorney general said that the backstop would offer Northern Ireland’s traders a competitive advantage over traders from European Union member states, including Ireland, because they could trade freely in both the single market and the rest of the UK. He suggested that, if the backstop persisted beyond a short period, it would be subject to a legal challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that article 50 of the EU treaty could not be the basis of a permanent arrangement with a non-EU state.Dozens of Conservative MPs have said publicly that they would vote against the withdrawal agreement, along with the DUP and the opposition parties. But Mr Cox said that, when weighed against the alternatives to backing the prime minister’s deal, it was a risk worth taking.“This represents a sensible compromise. It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us. But the question for the House is to weigh it up against the other potential alternatives and to assess whether it amounts to a calculated risk that this government and this House should take in these circumstances,” he said. – Additional reporting ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: PA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May’s government has been found in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its full legal advice on the prime minister’s deal with the EU on the UK’s exit from the bloc.The vote also orders the immediate publication of the “final and full” legal advice on the Brexit deal.MPs supported the cross-party motion to find ministers in contempt of parliament by 311 votes to 293.MPs had earlier rejected a government amendment to the motion, which asked for the parliament’s Committee of Privileges to examine whether ministers were in contempt of parliament over the issue and could have delayed any publication of the advice.British MPs have also voted to hand more power to parliament over what happens next if Mrs May’s Brexit deal is rejected on December 11th, in a move which could diminish the chances of a no-deal exit from the union. The procedural change means MPs could put forward alternatives if the current deal on the table is rejected. Following the votes, Mrs May officially opened five days of debate in parliament on her Brexit deal, ahead of a crucial vote on December 11th, when MPs will be asked to approve it.She addressed the contentious backstop for Northern Ireland, a default post-Brexit option based around avoiding a hard Border in the absence of alternative arrangements, which is enshrined in the deal. Mrs May said that without the backstop there is no deal. She said that she understands there are fears that the backstop, if invoked, would last indefinitely, but said the legal text of the deal made it clear that the backstop would be temporary. She said the backstop was not a trick to trap the UK in the EU.Opposition parties and the DUP, which props up Mrs May’s minority government, were furious that the government only provided an outline of the legal advice on its Brexit deal after parliament had voted to be given the full advice.They subsequently put forward a motion that if passed would find ministers in contempt of parliament and order the immediate publication of the full advice.“The government is wilfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this House and that is contempt,” Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party’s Brexit spokesman, told the House of Commons at the start of the debate on the contempt motion on Tuesday. “This motion is a last resort.”Following the vote on Tuesday, parliament leader Andrea Leadsom said the government would publish the full legal advice on Wednesday.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds confirmed that his party had backed the contempt motion and had been “crucial” in defeating the government.Meanwhile, prospects of a head-to-head Brexit debate between Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May on Sunday have been dampened after the BBC dropped plans to host it. The broadcaster said it was “disappointed” not to have reached an agreement on the proposals for the debate, saying it wanted the programme to have included other voices.Speaking during the debate on the contempt motion, Mr Dodds criticised the government for ignoring the vote passed by the House and refusing to release the full Brexit legal advice. He said it was not up to attorney general Geoffrey Cox to decide whether it was “in the national interest” to publish it. His DUP colleague Sammy Wilson then intervened to say: “If the government, and the prime minister, is going round the country trying to convince the populace that this is a good deal, this secret approach only confirms in people’s minds that there’s something to hide, and if anything the government is scoring an own goal by refusing to provide this advice.” So many politicians from Mrs May’s own Conservatives have spoken out against the deal that the odds look stacked against her winning the December 11th vote.Mr Cox on Monday gave parliament an outline of the legal advice on Monday.Ms Leadsom had said earlier on Tuesday that this had been a “full and frank exposition”, and that releasing the full advice would set a dangerous precedent. She said the government had fulfilled the spirit of the order to publish.Mrs May’s spokesman said the cabinet agreed that ministers must be able to obtain candid legal advice “without fear that it will be immediately published”. – ReutersPADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But this had not been unexpected, Irish officials and senate sources say. Since the weekend, two of those “holds” have been lifted, but four remain, indicating that senators are seeking further information.The senators in question are Republican, but with the Trump administration supporting the Bill, it is hoped that their concerns will be assuaged. One possible pitfall for Ireland is that South Korea may also want its citizens to be included in the visa scheme which is currently only available to Australia. Members of US Congress, dignitaries and the general public streamed into the rotunda of the US Capitol on Tuesday to pay their respects to former President George HW Bush. He is lying in state in the Capitol until his funeral on Wednesday in Washington National Cathedral.As a result, senate business has been delayed, and no vote is likely to take place until Wednesday night at the earliest.With the US government facing the prospect of a partial government shutdown this Friday, a two-week temporary funding measure has been effectively agreed, which means that the current congress may sit until December 21st. It had been scheduled to adjourn a week earlier.As a result, a vote on the extension of the E3 visa scheme could be pushed into next week, though technically a vote could take place this week.US special envoy John Deasy is in Washington this week for negotiations as Irish lobbying continues.He declined to comment on the details of the negotiation, but said that Ireland is continuing to make progress. “The Senate procedures take time, and we’re working our way through this,” he said.Ireland is hoping to secure congressional approval before the current Congress finishes at the end of the year, to allow Irish citizens access to the E3 visa scheme which was granted to Australia in 2005. Currently, Australians only take up about half of the 10,500 annual allocation. While Canberra initially had some concerns about the development on its own citizens, the Australian embassy in Washington now supports Irish efforts and is working along with the Embassy of Ireland to potentially secure improvements to the current scheme.The Bill needs unanimous support in the Senate, before it can pass to the White House for signing.An agreement would open an important pathway to Irish citizens seeking to live and work in the United States. The Embassy of Ireland in Washington and Mr Deasy have been advancing talks with senior figures on Capitol Hill and within the Trump administration over recent months."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Meanwhile, 27 per cent were found to be obese, and 72 per cent admitted consuming fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.More than half those polled had at least two risk factors, the data for England from 2016 and 2017 found.The survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles.The findings show a steep rise in diabetes rates between 1994 and 2017 - from 3 per cent to 8 per cent among men, and from 2 to 5 per cent among women.  The increase has been largest for those aged 65 to 74, increasing from 5 per cent in 1994 to 15 per cent in 2017.The research also compared the lifestyles of children with their parents.Children of obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. In total, 28 per cent of children of an obese mother and 24 per cent of children of an obese father had such weight problems.One in 20 women in England is now classed as morbidly obese, according to the analysis by NHS Digital. Overall, 64 per cent of adults were found to be carrying excess weight.This includes five per cent of women and two per cent of men who are morbidly obese - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score over 40.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenIn 1993, when the survey began, just one per cent of women were morbidly obese.Susannah Brown, senior scientist at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “Unhealthy choices increase the likelihood of developing cancer, so it is worrying to see that over half of adults have two or more of these risk factors, especially as we know that around 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable.After not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being more active each day and maintaining a healthy weight are the most important ways you can reduce your cancer risk. The responsibility to live healthily does not lie solely with iniduals – a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is necessary to create environments for people and communities that are conducive to healthy living, she said.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures should “shame” successive governments, accusing them of failing to take action to encourage healthier lifestyles.John Maingay, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the British Heart Foundation, said:  “These alarming figures suggest we could be storing up a future of health problems for future generations unless we act now. Obese children are more likely to be obese adults and this, coupled with spiralling diabetes rates, could lead to thousands more people suffering heart attacks and strokes in the coming years.”Almost 4 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes, with nine in ten cases Type 2, which is linked to obesity. Dan Howarth, from Diabetes UK, warned that another 12 million people are at risk of developing the condition.“To prevent these millions from developing Type 2 diabetes, we must educate people about their risk of developing the condition, and help them minimise their risk by making the necessary lifestyle changes, which include eating better and moving more, he said. Brexit deal latest news: Ministers found in contempt of Parliament and will publish full Brexit legal adviceMuslim takes local council to High Court because their burial rules \u0026#39breach his human rights\u0026#39Ama Agbeze on how \u0026#39funetherness\u0026#39 mantra helped England netball team achieve golden successBBC abandons plans for Theresa May vs Jeremy Corbyn Brexit debate after failing to break impasseComment: With a heavy heart, I am leaving Ukip.

And then update them again.Early next year, the company should release an update that brings a wireless charging case that allows them to power up just by being placed onto a wireless charging mat. It might also bring other changes, such as improved connectivity, an improved hinge on the door that clicks open and lets the earphones out\u0026nbspand new features, leaks suggested.That\u0027s according to a report from usually reliably analyst Ming-Chi\u0026nbspKuo, who reports that none of the new earphones will be ready for this Christmas season.Then a year later, in early 2020, the company will bring an all-new design.

Rumours have suggested that the company might be struggling to make the technology work, and some have suggested that it might be dropped entirely.The company had even showed off what appeared to be the new AirPods\u0026nbspcase alongside its charging mat, suggesting that both would be coming soon.

The stream of tech workers leaving the UK began in the summer of 2016, Mr Bossicard told the New Statesman. Pound value jumps after ECJ official says UK can cancel BrexitIt’s not just us consumed by Brexit – the whole world is watchingFinal Say: Two-thirds of students demand referendum on Brexit deal“Since Brexit began, 3,500 jobs have moved here from the UK and we expect far more to come after Brexit officially happens,” he said.

Ahead of the EU referendum, job losses linked to Brexit were forecast to be in the hundreds of thousands but since the vote these projections have been curtailed. However, the Bank of England has said that Britain is set to lose 5,000 financial services jobs by 29 March next year, a prediction backed by the Treasury. MPs are set to begin debating Theresa May’s Brexit deal, with a vote on the agreement due to take place in the coming days.

With a name like Legacy, the business could be selling investment products, luxury watches or even legal services. Except the assets in question are of the flesh-and-blood variety. Legacy is a mail-order service for freezing sperm.Khaled Kteily, the young founder of Legacy, came up with the idea for his business five years ago. But it wasn’t until 2017\u0026nbspthat researchers published a statistic\u0026nbspthat made\u0026nbspmen sit up and listen. A\u0026nbspstudy found sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by more than 50 per cent in less than 40 years. Other studies have suggested stress, smoking, obesity and exposure to pesticides and chemicals may all be at fault.\u0026nbspClimate change could lead to lower sperm count in men, study showsHe was everything I was searching for – in a sperm donorNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainAllan Pacey, professor of Andrology\u0026nbspat the University of Sheffield, says men are becoming more preoccupied with their fertility for another reason: “In my opinion, more cases of male infertility are being seen because men and their partners are waiting until they are older before trying for a family. This flushes out cases of male infertility that would not have been seen if the couple had tried for a family at a younger age when they were more fertile.”Unlike women, men are not told that “the clock is ticking” nor are they bombarded with adverts for fertility clinics and apps from the minute they turn 30. Many men may not start thinking about their own fertility until they start trying to conceive. Yet, among infertile heterosexual couples, the man is the cause in roughly half of the cases. Pacey dislikes the idea of an “infertility industry”, but he accepts that greater awareness of male infertility has created a growing market for startups offering solutions.\u0026nbspKteily says he founded Legacy to reshape the way that men and women think about family planning. “Men are sensitive about talking about fertility, so we are focused on creating a brand for men to be proactive about fertility,” he says. Kteily grew up in Lebanon, studied in Canada and the US, and established Legacy in Geneva, in part because he wants it to be seen as “the Swiss private bank for sperm”.“For a lot of the world, Switzerland has an association with quality. Think of Swiss banks, Swiss watches and even chocolate,” he says. “We have a strong emphasis on quality, privacy and security.”Kteily had never thought much about his own fertility, until a friend told him that\u0026nbsphe had to freeze his sperm after being told he had\u0026nbspcancer at the age of 30. After this conversation, Kteily went into a clinic to freeze his own\u0026nbspsperm but found the whole process awkward. He believes other men will also be sufficiently put-off by the prospect of attending a clinic to deposit their sperm over doing it at home and sending it to a lab.Legacy offers three packages to clients, starting with the bronze package for $1000, which includes fertility analysis and storage deposit of sperm for one year. A third-tier platinum package “is designed for the man who wants to preserve his healthiest genetic legacy in light of ongoing advances in healthcare”. It costs $10,000 for up to six deposits, genetic testing, fertility analysis and indefinite storage at multiple sites.\u0026nbspCoolmen is a device that cools and maintains the temperature in the testicles to improve fertility in men (Courtesy Photo)The website also contains a note about a research programme that plans “to study the sperm of the world’s most successful men”, which\u0026nbspinvolves strict eligibility criteria and a charitable contribution. When asked for more details, Kteily says the idea to study the genetic makeup of some sperm is still in its early stages. But he agrees that Legacy was modelled in part on another genetic testing service, 23andme. This mail-order DNA testing service was valued at $1.1bn in October 2015, nine years after it was founded. Kteily makes one clear distinction between Legacy and 23andme, which has come under fire for profiting off the sale of customer data Legacy would never sell customer data, Kteily says. It assigns a unique ID to each client to anonymise the process,\u0026nbsp“just like a Swiss private bank”.The UK’s Human, Fertilisation and Embryology Authority lists hundreds of private clinics in the UK charging on average between £175 and £450 to freeze sperm per year. But Pacey says some men may prefer to do a test at home if it means they don’t have to go to a clinic.He adds that the many attempts to develop male fertility products, from underwear, to mobile phone cases, to sperm-testing kits have often failed, perhaps because of male shame. “I have never sensed that they have taken off,” he says. “I wonder if this is because men are too embarrassed to buy them, or whether or not they are simply not interested in this topic until fertility becomes an issue in their lives.”The hidden trauma of male infertilityOne new device is hoping it will fare better than the competition. Coolmen was founded in 2016 in Poland. It promises to improve male fertility by cooling the testicles using a device held in place by a waist belt. “According to the current studies, approximately 60 per cent of all male infertility is caused by too high temperature of testicles, which is the direct reason for inappropriate sperm quality,” Dorota Partyka, programme manager for Coolmen, says. “When we consider this condition, freezing sperm which is not good quality simply doesn’t make sense.”The two businesses will meet at Disrupt Berlin, a startup conference hosted by TechCrunch, where they will be the only two male fertility\u0026nbspstartups in attendance despite a\u0026nbspmarket that some analysts expect to reach $4.7bn by 2025.“The main issue with any kind of product or service like this aimed at male fertility will be whether or not it speaks to men,” Pacey says. But, with sperm counts falling by an average of 1.4 per cent per year, startups like these may find an increasing number of men willing to have the conversation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Bossicard said Brexit offered a “huge opportunity” for Brussels, and added the city has a lot of offer UK companies, including single market access and good links to other European countries. Ahead of the EU referendum, job losses linked to Brexit were forecast to be in the hundreds of thousands but since the vote these projections have been curtailed. However, the Bank of England has said that Britain is set to lose 5,000 financial services jobs by 29 March next year, a prediction backed by the Treasury. MPs are set to begin debating Theresa May’s Brexit deal, with a vote on the agreement due to take place in the coming days.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He’s the son of a China-based globalist who, after being raised in a reclusive compound, developed “unsurpassed skills” in kung fu.Stan Lee had already filmed his Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 cameosDeadline reports that Marvel is already considering numerous Asian and Asian-American directors for the fast-tracked film bosses are hoping will emulate the success of Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther which tapped into African and African American culture and featured a nearly all-black cast.With Avengers 4 set to end an era of Marvel films, a Shang-Chi film will be a progressive step forward for the MCU, which studio president Kevin Feige is curating. Diversity is evidently key for Marvel: alongside Callahan and Coogler, filmmakers to have been hired by the studios include Chinese director Chloé Zhao and\u0026nbspthe Australian\u0026nbspCate Shortland, who’ll direct Black Widow‘s first standalone film.Created with Sketch.33 Superhero films set for release between 2016 and 2020 Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Release date: 6 May 2016. Iron Man and Captain America are set to face off in this superhero blockbuster that will feature nearly all the Avengers but won’t be an Avengers film. It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016. Following the success of Days of Future Past, Apocalypse will follow the young X-Men team as the battle against Oscar Isaac’s titular villain as he gathers his four horsemen Magneto (Fassbender), Angel (Hardy), Storm (Shipp), and Psylocke (Munn). Expect carnage and no Wolverine. Release date: 5 August 2016. The first ‘supervillain’ film, Suicide Squad is also based in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe, where Batman and Superman live) and will introduce the world to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker. One of the more exciting upcoming DC films that’s for sure.Release date: 4 November 2016. Benedict Cumberbatch will debut in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, where Captain America and Iron Man live) as the Sorcerer Supreme. The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017. Kicking off 2017 is the Lego version of Batman, who will lead his own spin-off, having already featured in the amazing Lego Movie. Will Arnett voices the titular character, while Zach Garfianakis - from the Hangover - will voice The Joker. But will he better than Leto?Release date: 3 March 2017. Having not starred in X-Men: Apocalypse, Wolverine will return to the big screen in a solo film which was recently made R-Rated following the success of Deadpool. It is expected to be Hugh Jackman’s last outing as the titular character.734 7. s of the Galaxy Vol. 2Release date: 5 May 2017. Chris Pratt and the crew are returning to space in the sequel to the surprisingly successful s of the Galaxy. According to director James Gunn, the film will not feature Thanos, even though he will to play a major role in phase MCU Phase 3. Cast includes newcomers Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff, as well as, rumour has it, Sylvester Stallone.Release date: 23 June 2017. Gal Gadot is returning to the DCEU in her very own film, marking the first female-led superhero film on this list. Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017. Hot on the heals of Thor comes Justice League Part One, the first DCEU team-up flick which will see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg work together to fight bad guys.Release date: 12 January 2018. Kicking off 2018 will likely be the second Deadpool film, but then again, this could very well be another X-Men team-up. There’s also talk of an X-Force film, with Deadpool and other mutants teaming up to fight evil.Release date: 16 February 2018. The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War. Creed’s Ryan Coogler is on to direct what could be a very exciting film.Release date: 16 March 2018. The Flash will be the first DCEU film since Justice League, and sees Ezra Miller take the lead. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were supposed to pen the film before Disney snapped them up for the Han Solo-film, leaving Seth Grahame-Smith to take charge.Release date: 4 May 2018. And so, we finally get to the point of all these Infinity Stones! Thanos will be the big bad, with the Avengers needing to team up to defeat their biggest foe yet. It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero. Release date: 13 July 2018. Again, not much word on this one except it is thought to be X-Men spin-off New Mutants, something Josh Boone has been hit up to write.Release date: 20 July 2018. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Amy Pascal - the team behind the live-action Spider-Man films - are producing this ‘unrelated’ animated adaptation of the hero. Because you can never have too much Spider-Man, right?Release date: 27 July 2018. Another Justice League spin-off, Jason Momoa plays the leading man. Furious 7’s James Wan is on to direct, but little else is known about the film.Release date: 8 March 2019. We’ve hit 2019, and the first confirmed superhero film will be the first proper female-led MCU film. No-one is confirmed to be in the titular role of Carol Danvers just yet.Release date: 5 April 2019. Dwayne Johnson stars as the villain in this DCEU film which will be somewhat separate to the other DC films.Release date: 3 May 2019. The conclusion to the long drawn MCU saga. Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020. Having debuted in Justice League Part One three years previously, Cyborg will finally be making his own outing, with Ray Fisher as the titular character.Release date: 1 May 2020. The first of three untitled Marvel films. There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020. Before you start to worry, this has nothing to do with the Ryan Reynolds-starring flick that hit cinemas a little while ago. Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade. But many believe the character may be better suited to a Netflix series, as with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. There’s also talk of a Runaways film reaching cinemas at some stage.Release date: TBA. Now we’re onto the TBA release dates, the first of which is a Batman solo film, written and directed by Ben Affleck. When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. Venom, as you may know, is a Spider-Man villain, intrinsically linked to Spider-Man, so it seems odd they would release a film unrelated to the rebooted project and not linked to the MCU.Well, now you mention it, there’s also that sequel to Fantastic Four that has seemingly been dropped by Fox. Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra). Then again, it could be shoehorned in somehow…Release date: 6 May 2016. Iron Man and Captain America are set to face off in this superhero blockbuster that will feature nearly all the Avengers but won’t be an Avengers film. It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016.

Having not starred in X-Men: Apocalypse, Wolverine will return to the big screen in a solo film which was recently made R-Rated following the success of Deadpool. It is expected to be Hugh Jackman’s last outing as the titular character.734 7. s of the Galaxy Vol. 2Release date: 5 May 2017. Chris Pratt and the crew are returning to space in the sequel to the surprisingly successful s of the Galaxy. According to director James Gunn, the film will not feature Thanos, even though he will to play a major role in phase MCU Phase 3. Cast includes newcomers Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff, as well as, rumour has it, Sylvester Stallone.Release date: 23 June 2017. Gal Gadot is returning to the DCEU in her very own film, marking the first female-led superhero film on this list. Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017. Hot on the heals of Thor comes Justice League Part One, the first DCEU team-up flick which will see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg work together to fight bad guys.Release date: 12 January 2018. Kicking off 2018 will likely be the second Deadpool film, but then again, this could very well be another X-Men team-up. There’s also talk of an X-Force film, with Deadpool and other mutants teaming up to fight evil.Release date: 16 February 2018. The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War. Creed’s Ryan Coogler is on to direct what could be a very exciting film.Release date: 16 March 2018. The Flash will be the first DCEU film since Justice League, and sees Ezra Miller take the lead. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were supposed to pen the film before Disney snapped them up for the Han Solo-film, leaving Seth Grahame-Smith to take charge.Release date: 4 May 2018. And so, we finally get to the point of all these Infinity Stones! Thanos will be the big bad, with the Avengers needing to team up to defeat their biggest foe yet. It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero. Release date: 13 July 2018. Again, not much word on this one except it is thought to be X-Men spin-off New Mutants, something Josh Boone has been hit up to write.Release date: 20 July 2018. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Amy Pascal - the team behind the live-action Spider-Man films - are producing this ‘unrelated’ animated adaptation of the hero. Because you can never have too much Spider-Man, right?Release date: 27 July 2018. Another Justice League spin-off, Jason Momoa plays the leading man. Furious 7’s James Wan is on to direct, but little else is known about the film.Release date: 8 March 2019. We’ve hit 2019, and the first confirmed superhero film will be the first proper female-led MCU film. No-one is confirmed to be in the titular role of Carol Danvers just yet.Release date: 5 April 2019. Dwayne Johnson stars as the villain in this DCEU film which will be somewhat separate to the other DC films.Release date: 3 May 2019. The conclusion to the long drawn MCU saga. Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020. Having debuted in Justice League Part One three years previously, Cyborg will finally be making his own outing, with Ray Fisher as the titular character.Release date: 1 May 2020. The first of three untitled Marvel films. There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020. Before you start to worry, this has nothing to do with the Ryan Reynolds-starring flick that hit cinemas a little while ago. Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade. But many believe the character may be better suited to a Netflix series, as with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. There’s also talk of a Runaways film reaching cinemas at some stage.Release date: TBA. Now we’re onto the TBA release dates, the first of which is a Batman solo film, written and directed by Ben Affleck. When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. Venom, as you may know, is a Spider-Man villain, intrinsically linked to Spider-Man, so it seems odd they would release a film unrelated to the rebooted project and not linked to the MCU.Well, now you mention it, there’s also that sequel to Fantastic Four that has seemingly been dropped by Fox. Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra). Then again, it could be shoehorned in somehow…Zhao, the director behind\u0026nbspacclaimed drama\u0026nbspThe Rider, will oversee The Eternals.Screenwriter Callahan is considered hot property at the moment having worked on DC sequel Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland 2 and will write the follow-up to Sony’s acclaimed animation Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2.

Theresa May\u0027s majority has evaporated, and the credibility of her deal is evaporating with it.Parliament has asserted itself, and the full legal advice must now be published as a matter of urgency.The Commons is now very likely to defeat the Government again next week on the Brexit deal, at which point the country must be given a People\u0027s Vote, and asked to choose between the deal or remaining in the EU.Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: This is a hammer blow to the Government and their agenda.The Government at the moment cannot even run a bath let alone anything else. The Prime Minister might remain in office but tonight she is out of power.Tonight\u0027s vote is a dark omen for next week\u0027s meaningful vote. The Government are facing a colossal defeat. It is time to agree to a People\u0027s Vote to end this deadlock.More on Nigel Farage quitting Ukip.\u0026nbspMr Farage said he was leaving Ukip in protest at the direction taken by the party\u0027s leader Gerard Batten.Mr Farage had called for Mr Batten to be ousted as leader after he appointed political activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser.Writing in the Daily , Mr Farage said: And so, with a heavy heart, and after all my years of devotion to the party, I am leaving Ukip today.There is a huge space for a Brexit party in British politics, but it won\u0027t be filled by Ukip.Theresa May is now on her feet, delivering an opening speech for the first of five days of debate on her Brexit deal.Not an easy feat, given that she has just lost three significant votes.Here is Dominic Grieve discussing why his amendment is so important in the Commons.\u0026nbspHilary Benn, Labour chair of the Brexit committee, said it was essential for parliament to have more of a say and called on MPs to back it.MPs are now voting on Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.Andrea Leadsom has called for an inquiry into the use of an arcane parliamentary procedure called a humble address - which resulted in Labour winning access to the government\u0027s Brexit legal advice.In a latter to the\u0026nbspCommittee of Privileges, Labour MP Kate Green, Ms Leadsom said: The government is concerned that the recent use of motions by\u0026nbsphumble\u0026nbspaddress undermine good government in the national interest.In particular, we are concerned that the use of this procedure to - for example - require the publication of Cabinet papers and legal advice will impact the ability of current and future governments to request and receive the best possible advice.Dominic Grieve is now up. He says his amendment will provide reassurance to MPs that the debate can continue after the vote next week, if needed.Labour MP Clive Efford\u0026nbsphas tabled several amendments to extend the debate to allow backbench MPs more time to speak. He says he will not push these to a vote as he thinks the point has been made.Things are moving very quickly now in the Commons. After that historic contempt vote, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is now setting out the business motion for the Brexit deal debate. The business motion effectively sets our the framework for the debate, eg how long it goes on for, what the terms of reference are.\u0026nbspThis is interesting because ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve has tabled a clever amendment to hand power to MPs if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve written about this in detail already (see here).\u0026nbspMs Leadsom urges MPs not to push this amendment to a vote, as she says it is important not to prejudge the vote next week.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s Valerie Vaz is having absolutely none of it. She says the PM has constantly tried to prevent parliament from having a say on Brexit.MPs have found Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspgovernment in\u0026nbspcontempt of parliament\u0026nbspover ministers\u0027 refusal to publish the legal advice they have received on\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspAndrea Leadsom confirms that the government will back down and will publish the legal advice in full.\u0026nbspMore here:\u0026nbspThe government has been found in CONTEMPT of parliament.\u0026nbspAyes - 311Noes - 293Majority - 18\u0026nbspExtraordinary scenes.

MPs voted down that amendment by 311 votes to 307.Speaker John Bercow\u0026nbsphad granted an urgent debate on a motion alleging contempt of Parliament after a request from all of the other Commons parties. Mr Bercow said he had deemed there was an arguable case that a contempt had been committed.Opening the debate, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said it was not good enough for ministers to claim it was not in the national interest to release the documents.\u0026nbspHe told the Commons: The government is willfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this House, and that is contempt.Yesterday the attorney general as good as admitted it, when he said \u0027I wish that I could comply with the request of the House, but if i did I sincerely believe it would not be in all our interests\u0027. Slightly later he said \u0027Although the House says I should disclose, I believe the public interest compels me not to do so. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027That is a plea of mitigation, it is not a defence.Responding for the government, Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, said: No honourable member could say in all honesty that the attorney general has done anything other than treat this House with the greatest of respect.There can be no question that he or the government has acted in a manner which is contemptuous of this House.But speaking moments after\u0026nbspMPs had passed the motion of contempt, Ms Leadsom said: We\u0027ve tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject. We\u0027ve listened\u0026nbspcarefully and in light of the expressed will of the House, we will publish the final and full advice provided by the attorney general to Cabinet.But recognising\u0026nbspthe very serious\u0026nbspconstitutional issues that this raises, I have referred the matter to the Privileges Committee to consider the implications\u0026nbspof the humble address.Mr Bercow said it would be unimaginable that the\u0026nbspadvice would not to be made public before MPs vote on the Brexit deal next week, prompting Ms Leadsom to confirm the government would respond on Wednesday.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereContempt of ParliamentShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The court’s Advocate General this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the Advocate General’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Predicting that Ms May\u0027s failure to could trigger a no confidence vote, she allegedly said\u0026nbspsaid Mr Javid\u0026nbspneeds to be really ready to deal with that.Ms Truss is also thought to be a possible candidate if a leadership election is triggered.Talking of her own views, she said her new vision was to unleash young activists to win over the next generation. Part of this, she is reported to have said, must be about the roads including getting large corporations to sponsor Britain\u0027s biggest motorways.According to Mr Polanski, she said: My new vision is all about the roads. We need to push to get company sponsorship for the Top 10 motorways. Like they have in the USA where Burger King sponsor pot holes. We\u0027ll wait until the New Year though because obviously now everything is consumed by Brexit.Ms Truss is also said to have criticised Ms May. She said the prime minister should have used Michael Gove, the environment secretary, more during negotiations with the EU to get Brexiteers on side. However, she said of her colleague: Mind you everyone hates him - they all blame him for not letting Boris be Boris. Then we wouldn\u0027t have Theresa as Prime Minister - and to be fair, they\u0027re right.Created with Sketch.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Excavators were seen working on the Israeli side of the border on Tuesday after an army spokesperson said an effort had begun to “thwart and neutralise” the tunnels before they became operational. The move is likely to raise tensions along the disputed Israel-Lebanon border, which has been relatively quiet since the last devastating flare-up of violence in 2006. Over the past few years, Syria has become the primary battleground for the historic foes. Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militant group and political party with a presence in the Lebanese parliament, has sent thousands of fighters to support its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Israel, meanwhile, has carried out frequent air strikes in Syria\u0026nbspto prevent the supply of weapons from Iran to its ally Hezbollah. But as that conflict has wound down, both sides appear to be increasingly turning their attention to Lebanon. Israel views Hezbollah as an existential threat due to its close relationship with Iran, and has made repeated threats to invade Lebanon to tackle the group. Hezbollah\u0026nbspjustifies its arms as a necessary deterrence against Israeli invasion. Israel criticised for picture of F-35 stealth jet flying over BeirutIsrael has watched with concern as Hezbollah has emerged from the Syrian war significantly stronger. Thousands of its fighters have gained valuable battlefield experience, and the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles than when it last fought Israel in 2006. Speaking last year, he said there would be “no place that is out of reach of the rockets of the resistance or the boots of the resistance fighters.”The group has made no secret of its extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, which it says is to deter Israel from attacking. In 2015, a report by Lebanese newspaper As-Safir, known for its pro-Hezbollah stance, published a detailed report on the group expanding its tunnel-building efforts. Many of those tunnels are built inside Lebanon, in anticipation of an Israeli invasion. Israel, too, has been making preparations for a future conflict. In addition to striking Iranian targets in Syria to prevent arms supplies to Hezbollah, earlier this year it began building a large wall along the border, which has never been internationally recognised. And as recently as September, the Israeli army conducted large-scale drills in northern Israel simulating a conflict with Hezbollah.Given Hezbollah has a history of digging tunnels in southern Lebanon, it wouldn\u0027t be a surprise if they were using a tried and true tactic that has shown some success\u0026nbspBoth sides have a history of using public threats as a means of deterrence, and of preparing for war in times of peace. But analysts said there was little risk of a major conflagration at this moment. \u0026nbsp“Given Hezbollah has a history of digging tunnels in southern Lebanon, it wouldn\u0027t be a surprise if they were using a tried and true tactic that has shown some success,” said Phillip Smyth, a fellow at the Washington Institute and a researcher on Shia armed groups.“It wouldn\u0027t be a shock if Hezbollah were planning something. However, even with their advancements in Syria, they seem to be taking things quite slowly,” he added.In a briefing to journalists, Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the tunnels constituted a flagrant and severe violation of Israeli sovereignty. He added that an anti-tunnel task force has been operating for more than four years, and spent a year and half preparing for this operation.Later on Tuesday, the Israeli army announced it had destroyed one tunnel, which it said was dug 25 meters underground and ran from an area to the south of the Lebanese village of Kfar Kala into Israeli territory.

The document states that failure to comply with these rules “could lead to the termination of the diplomatic asylum granted by the Ecuadorian state”Lt. Col Conricus claimed that the underground passage was a part of \u0026nbspthe “surprise component” of Hezbollah’s plan to infiltrate Israel and attack civilians or soldiers. \u0026nbsp“We hold the Lebanese government responsible for all of these activities,” he added. The Israeli operation began hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels, in which the two discussed ways to halt together Iranian aggression in the region. The administration of President Donald Trump has taken a significantly more aggressive stance towards Iran and Hezbollah than his predecessor. \u0026nbspMr Netanyahu, who is also acting defence minister, is currently mired in a corruption scandal at home, which has led some to question the timing of the operation. MK Yoel\u0026nbspHasson, chair of the opposition Zionist Union, accused Netanyahu of cheapening the Israeli army.\u0026nbspThe bulldozer operation in Israeli territory leaves us no alternative but to question the timing and presentation of the operation, he said.\u0026nbsp“In the end the main reason is strategic and not political,” Amos Harel, defence expert and writer for left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz, told The Independent. \u0026nbsp“But it might come in as useful, as the discussion moves towards policy and strategic threat and not politics and corruption.”The last major battle between the two sides was sparked by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah in 2006 to kidnap two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah had hoped to use the soldiers as to pressure Israel to release Lebanese prisoners, but it instead prompted a devastating Israeli attack that led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians. Forty-four Israeli civilians were also killed by Hezbollah rockets. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting Israeli troops who were occupying southern Lebanon.Israel invaded Lebanon numerous times during the country\u0027s 1975-1990 civil war, and occupied much of the south of the country for some 22 years. During the occupation, Hezbollah dug extensive tunnel networks across the south of the country and used them to launch ambushes and move around unseen by Israeli jets. Today, it is possible for tourists to visit one part of that tunnel network, which has been preserved in a museum near the town of Mleeta. Hezbollah declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They could then decide which to make public.The humble address was passed unanimously as the Tories sensed defeat and so called on its MPs not to attend the vote to save face.Keir Starmer said he expected ministers to release the studies as a result.“Labour has been absolutely clear since the referendum that ministers could not withhold vital information from parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,” he said.“It’s completely unacceptable for the Tories to have wasted months avoiding responsible scrutiny and trying to keep the public in the dark.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s what Piers and I live on - the victims, coming forward and confessing their unhappiness.“She’s trying to be Diana, trying to adopt the new role. The tragedy is that it will end in the same way unless someone steps in from the palace and says this is the way it’s done here.”Piers also said Meghan is very dferent to Kate Middleton, who he described as being very home counties and safe.He added: Kate Middleton is very “home counties” and safe, almost groomed for the role - it’s much easier for everybody to have that kind of person.“Meghan is from a very dferent background, a TV star, and probably finds the Palace system very suffocating and annoying.“And the people around her like the formality of it and probably equally find her annoying.”Mr Bower added: “The problem is there’s never been in the Palace someone who can step forward and say look Meghan, this is how you may have done it in Hollywood, but here in London we do it this way.Speaking to Radhika, he said: The problem is that the argument you’re putting forward is that she’s living in a goldfish bowl.“You wrote that she deserves privacy. She doesn’t, she’s on public display and when you’re on public display   there’s a certain way of behaving.”Piers added: “You can’t go after a prince as she did. And I know she did.

It’s probably an ongoing massive issue. For a woman to just cut her father off.“From the moment she met Harry she ditched anyone who could have been a problem.“The two most consistently beloved people in the royal family are the queen mother and the queen.“What is the most common denominator  They’ve never given an interview and they don’t’ respond to criticism and they don’t’ engage in day to day headlines. They rise effortless and regally above it all.The queen is the most revered person in the world you could argue and she’s done so by saying nothing in public and behaving like a royal.”Ms Sanghani said: “But what Meghan is doing is inspiring a generation and being dferent and being fresh and I’m a massive fan.”Piers added: “Well she didn’t inspire me, she sacked me like a sack of spuds.

Matt Hess, , from Surrey, started taking the steroids at -years-old, around eight years after he first started suffering from spots. While at first they provided some relief, Mr Hess says his skin looked even worse when he developed a topical steroid addiction. He says that when withdrawing from the treatment he was left with red, thick skin, which caused strangers to stare, with one even labelling him a zombie. However after ditching steroids in favour of a plant-based diet  months ago, Mr Hess skin is almost back to normal. This also comes as the designer decided quit his job and moved to Thailand this year, where he believes that the warm weather and stress-free lestyle also aiding his recovery. It took  months for any sign of progress to arise but now Matt is mostly recovered after detoxing his body of the steroid residue.  Now, Matt hopes to educate others on the effects of taking prescription medication too leniently after enduring topical steroid withdrawal. He told MailOnline: The problem is, while antibiotics kill the infections, they also kill the good bacteria, which are critical for overall health. Mr Hess initially tried anti-acne face washes in his teens before finally being prescribed antibiotics at . His inflamed skin was a result of poor diet, lestyle and having a genetic disadvantage making him prone to skin problems, all of which doctors overlooked.  However after taking antibiotics, Matt began experiencing digestive problems, food intolerances, rosacea and sinus problems. He said: They suppress your immune system, so your bodys defences are weakened and your toxic load builds up. When I was going through the withdrawal, a man on the train told me I looked like a zombie and told me to get off the train. People also used to stare at me in public a lot.  As well as believing he was treated inappropriately, Mr Hess, who is training to be a nutritionist, also blames his hectic lestyle for his skin problems. The deteriorating condition of his skin led to heightened anxiety because of the way people would stare at his face and question his appearance. After realising that the treatment was the cause for his painfully inflamed skin and digestive problems, Matt got rid of the treatment and began to heal holistically instead.  He said his diet was dreadful as he would eat ready meals, processed foods, energy drinks and no fruit or vegetables. On top of a plant-based diet, he also exercises daily to promote cardiovascular health, sweating and detoxication. Matt also drinks lots of clean water, about two-to-three litres a day, and tries to think positively and appreciate le as much as possible. Mr Hess is speaking out to raise awareness of topical steroid addiction, and encourages patients to bite the bullet and go through the dreaded withdrawal stage. He added: It will be one of the most challenging things you ever have to go through, but you will come out of the other side stronger, wiser and healthier.

One in  don’t know Omega- - which is believed to lower the risk of heart disease - is a fat found in fish, flax seeds and walnuts - with some even mistaking it for a watch brand. Twenty-nine per cent confused choline, found in caullower and an essential nutrient, with chlorine, which has been used as a chemical weapon. The research of , UK adults was commissioned to launch KNOW Your Nitrates , a campaign aimed at educating people on nitrates in drinking water.

Six in  don’t think they’re getting enough vitamins in their diet but  per cent wouldnt be able to spot the signs they are vitamin deficient or not.

That is why it is so important to read the labels on your food and drinks. It is crucial to know what you are putting in your body as this affects your health both physically and mentally. The research also found maintaining health is our biggest priority when it comes to nutrition. This was closely followed by upping energy levels and getting all of the vitamins and minerals needed toproperly. Interestingly,  per cent of those polled they don’t read the ingredients list on food and drink purchases at all.  Nine in  arent aware nitrates in drinking water can have a negative impact on health. While five per cent wrongly believe nitrates in mineral water - pollutants and heavy oxidants which enter the water table from agricultural fertilisers and leaking septic tanks - are good for you. Only  per cent know nitrates can end up in mineral water from chemical fertilisers, and just nine per cent know nitrates are pollutants from the water table. Dr Marilyn Glenville added: The lack of understanding about nitrates, particularly in water, shown in the survey was of concern. And also, for me, as a nutritionist, to learn that in many European countries, the legislation requires that the nitrate content in water should not exceed mg per litre. But in the UK the limit is mg per litre for adults and there is no legislation in place for children.” Dr Sarah Brewer, nutritionist, said: “While our interest in health and wellbeing is increasing, it’s clear from Aqua Carpatica’s research that more information is needed around even simple, everyday products like drinking water. Few people are aware that nitrates, which can leach into water from fertilisers, manure and septic tanks, have been linked to potentially serious health issues including breathing problems for newborn infants, thyroid and circulatory problems, and headaches. Some people may prefer to choose a water that is nitrate-free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle secretly attends busy","story":"NewsMeghan Markle secretly attends busy London event to meet pal Michelle ObamaMichelle Obama spoke at London Southbanks Centre to launch her new book Becoming in front of a sold out crowd - including Duchess of Sussex Meghan MarkleShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  DEC NewsMeghan was in the crowd to watch pal Michelle Obama \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle made a secret visit to Londons Southbank Centre to watch an event by her pal Michelle Obama.

Earlier this week Mrs Obama offered some public words of support to Meghan after several reports of her upsetting royal staff . Speaking to Good Housekeeping, she said: Like me, Meghan probably never dreamt shed have a le like this and the pressure you feel can sometimes feel like a lot. So my biggest pieces of advice would be take some time and dont be in a hurry to do anything. I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it’s OK – good, even – to do that. The Clooneys are good friends with Meghan and Harry and were guests at their wedding back in May. There are also rumours the actor and his lawyer we could be Godparents to baby Sussex when he or she arrives in the spring.

School bosses decided to step in as they claim the generous presents put staff in an awkward position, reports the Times. They have therefore asked all parents to stick to the limit and theyve also put a pound cap on all group presents. According to teachers on the parenting website Mumsnet, the normal price tag for teacher gts is between pound and pound.   The policy has been in place for a number of years but a letter was sent out to clary the rules. The independent schools Bursar David Eley said: As a charitable organisation we are obliged to have a policy in this area to ensure strong governance. Our staff policy has been in place for a number of years and no concerns have ever arisen over this matter. We have issued a letter to parents to provide clarity and to prevent placing staff or parents in an awkward position. We have a great relationship with our parent body and a powerful sense of community which is built on this kind of transparency clarity. The school, which was attended by Samantha Cameron, has fees of pound, a term. However the decision has been criticised by Janita Gray, senior editor at the Good School Guide, who is concerned it may make parents feel pound is the normal rate for a present. Many teachers believe even pound would be far too much to spend, with one writing on Mumsnet: Id be mortiedevery parent thought they had to spend pound on me, over the class that would be pound.

Epstein, , is accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls and turning them into sex-slaves. US police discovered how Epstein lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach mansion as part of a cult-like sex pyramid scheme. The settlement deal, for an undisclosed sum, was announced on this morning before jury selection began for a potential trial.   Attorney Bradley Edwards, who was seeking undisclosed damages against Epstein, announced a settlement had been reached meaning none of the millionaires alleged victims could testy. The case was not filed by the women who were allegedly molested by Epstein. Their lawyer, Mr Edwards, sued the financier for malicious prosecution after he claimed the victims lawsuits were part of a Ponzi scheme run by a former law partner. Edwards has previously won pound.m [.m] for some of Epsteins victims.   At least one of Epsteins accusers was expected to testy in the case. More than  other women have claimed Epstein lured them to his home and recruited them to have sex with his friends when they were aged between  and . In a statement, Edwards said: This is not a compromise, it is a surrender by Jeffrey Epstein. Epsteins lawyer, Scott Link, then read out a statement from his client saying: I sincerely apologise for the allegations that I made against Mr Edwards. Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele thanked the women who planned to testy.   “To those that were here that were planning to testy and were involved in the matters with Epstein in the past, I thank you for being willing to step forward and having the courage to do so,” the judge said. At a press conference outside the courthouse, attorney Jack Scarola, who was representing Mr Edwards, said the public attention helped to bring about a settlement in the case. Last week, The Miami Herald published an expose about Epstein which included interviews with some of his alleged victims who had never spoken before. The newspaper found that despite a litany of evidence against Epstein, federal prosecutors and his lawyers put together a deal for the former friend of Prince Andrew.  In exchange for pleading guilty to two felony charges in state court, he and his accomplices received immunity from federal sex trafficking charges that could have put him behind bars for le. The newspaper reports he got the sweetheart plea deal in exchange for becoming a government enforment. Epstein pleaded guilty to two charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution in . He was sentenced to just  months in county jail and  months house arrest - but he only served  months.   He served just over a year of his sentence in a private wing of the prison and was even allowed to leave to leave for  hours per day, six days per week on work release. His alleged co-conspirators were never prosecuted. The deal was sealed so no one could discover the extent of his crimes or who  was involved. Even his victims were not allowed to know the particulars of the deal. Alexander Acosta, the US attorney in Miami was personally involved in the negotiations of the deal. He is now Donald Trumps labour secretary.

The -year-old models Masha and Dasha Ledeneva were rushed to intensive care in Moscow after following a warning that the girls had become “living corpses” who no-one wanted to help. Five days ago Maria Kokhno, , a campaigner for eating disorder victims, went public with a desperate plea for medical help for the pair who were at risk of “lying and dying at home” after doctors “refused” to intervene. Earlier, they had both gone into a coma for three days at another hospital but after they came round were allowed home even though they were desperately ill, said Kokhno, herself a model and reality show star who has overcome anorexia .  At the time Dasha had reduced to  kgand her sister Masha to  kg . The already-slim teenage models had been told they should reduce weight so their cheekbones were visible in order to be given more shoots, claims Kokhno. As a result of her plea the girls were rushed to a hospital in capital city Moscow,  miles north of their home in industrial city Lipetsk.  “Nobody was keen to help the girls, their mother went here and there, hospitals were rejecting them,” said Kokhno. “Masha can stand up but Dasha is only lying and cannot even lt her head,” said Kokhno. “The mother contacted TV presenter Elena Malysheva and the Nutrition Institute in Moscow but nobody wanted to deal with ‘living corpses’. Kokhno said the family reached out to her “in despair” leading to her emotional appeal to assist the girls. TV channel Moscow showed Kokhno with the girls as they entered hospital in Moscow and quoted a doctor saying the medical task “is to rescue them from a condition when their heart may stop beating at any moment”.  Kakhno said: “Dasha is slimmer than her sister, Masha has always been a bit more plump. “But still both twins were told in theto lose five kilosof weight each, so their cheekbones were visible. Both were about  kilosthen. “The girls began to diet, they did not eat after  pm and ate only steamed food. “Gradually, their portions and the number of their meals went down.  “Dasha, who has been perfect in everything, lost her weight down to  kg. “Masha tried to catch up with her lost her weight to  kg. “It was the critical weight for each girl.” She said: “The sisters were taken to hospital where they injected them with tranquilisers, so Dasha was in coma for three days. “When she woke up, their mother took both girls back home.” Kokhno said the case had left her “constantly crying” for two days when she first heard about the girls’ plight.  She has already helped other teenagers with anorexia and launched her appeal saying: “I want to find people who will help to rescue the girls who are lying and dying at home. “Their mother gave up her job and she is at home with both girls now.” Their distraught mother Natalia Ledeneva said: “They were told Dasha’s body shape is quite okay but Masha should get rid of couple of kilos… “The girls heard it in their own way. “These children have always been perfect in everything, so they decided to be perfect here too. “It all happened very quickly.  “At first, they began to reject … “They said – ‘we won’t have anything sweet tonight’ or ‘we won’t have any fruit’ or ‘we will have only salad’. “They would have one cutlet and two spoonfuls of buckwheat for dinner. “I was running after both of them, trying to persuade … “I thought they would hear what I was saying. “But it is that kind of disease when they do not hear you, the disease was progressing.”  Fighting back tears she said: “Whatever I did, however I tried to persuade them, it led to nothing…” Alexey Dobrovolsky, a well-known television doctor in Russia, said: “At first the person loses and loses weight, and finally when the brains switch on, they stop doing it.” But the body had already “transformed”. “Now whatever the human being wants to do, all the biochemical processes in his body are already ruined. “As a result, we get the kind of weight both girls have now. “The patients are in intensive care. “The task of the doctors is to rescue them from a condition when their heart may stop beating at any moment. “ Kokhno, formerly a star of the Dom- reality show, warned: “Please pay attention to your relatives. “Maybe someone close to you is quickly losing weight  “It is important to discover anorexia as early as possible.” The twins modelling school in Lipsetsk has not commented.

Astonishingly the Ryan ToysReview channel has  million followers, putting him at the top of the  Forbes list. The schoolboys videos show him reviewing toys, and his verdict has a huge impact on product sales. Ryan, who posts a new video each day, has been doing it since March , with his parents and twin sisters also featuring. When he was asked by NBC why his channel is doing so well, he replied: Because Im entertaining and Im funny.   His mum - who has declined to reveal her full name - quit her job as a chemistry teacher to concentrate on her sons growing internet career, The Verge previously reported. His mum said Ryan was an avid review watcher before his channel was launched. She told TubeFilter: “One day, he asked me, ‘How come I’m not on YouTube when all the other kids are ’ So we just decided - yeah, we can do that. Then, we took him to the store to get his very first toy - I think it was a Lego train set - and it all started from there.”   She said most of the videos are filmed at the weekend, and edited while Ryan is at school. Forbes says that most of his viewers are children of a similar age, and most of his videos open with him playing with a new toy before sharing his thoughts. Because he is so young, % of Ryans earnings are being held in a trust until he is older. Last year he was the eighth highest earner, bringing in million - half the amount from this year.  Second on the list was Jake Paul, who posts pranks and rap music. Paul - whose older brother Logan Paul also made the top , coming in th place - earned pound.million on YouTube after amassing more than . billion views.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee midfielder nick ross going loco with us move in bid for mls promotion","story":"Former Dundee midfielder Nick Ross hopes his move to American second-tier side El Paso Locomotive can provide a lucrative stepping stone to Major League Soccer.After ending a short stint with Brora Rangers, Ross sealed a move to the newly-formed Texas outfit yesterday on a one-year contract with the option of a further year.The -year-old will report for pre-season with El Paso in January as the club prepares for its  debut in the USL Championship.Although no promotion to the ring-fenced MLS is available, former Scotland U  international Ross hopes making an impression at his new club may catch the eye of clubs higher up the American ladder.Ross said: “I’m just looking forward to getting over and seeing how the year goes.“If I play well over there the target is to get into the MLS but that’s everybody’s target so it’s not that easy.There are a lot of good teams at this level. Before he retired recently, Didier Drogba was playing at this level for Phoenix Rising.“There’s no promotion, which is maybe the only downfall. Butyou can get yourself into an MLS team, with the way it’s going and the money they are putting into it, it’s going to be huge.“With David Beckham getting a team, in the next few years it’s going to be really big.”Before this move, Ross also had a brief stint in Romania with Sepsi Sfantu Gheorghe last summer.He said: “In football you are so fortunate, you can try to go anywhere in the world and play football.“I just thought I would try something dferent.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"college go bust in few","story":"NewsCollege will go bust in a few yearsSenior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsAyrshire College jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire College will go bust “in a few short years,” it has been claimed. Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

Theresa May was due to open a five-day debate on her deal, amid widespread expectation that her proposals are set for rejection by MPs.Minutes after the historic contempt vote, the Government went down to its third defeat in the space of an hour as MPs backed a move which could put Parliament in the driving seatthe Brexit deal is rejected on December .If her deal falls in the ldquomeaningful vote next week, the PM has  calendar days to set out a statement on her next steps.Former attorney general Dominic Grieversquos amendment will make any such statement itself amendable, meaning that MPs can effectively direct the Government on how to respond to the defeat of Mrs Mayrsquos plans.This could open the door for the Commons to throw its weight behind a Norway-style soft Brexit, or even a second EU referendum, though prominent Leave-backing MPs questioned whether any such vote would be binding on ministers.Labourrsquos shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that the finding of contempt was ldquoa badge of shame for the Government, with ldquohuge constitutional and political signicance.It is the first time in modern history that a Government has been found in contempt of Parliament.ldquoIt is highly regrettable that the Government has let it come to this, but ministers left the opposition with no option but to bring forward these proceedings, said Sir Keir.ldquoBy treating Parliament with contempt, the Government has proved it has lost its majority and the respect of the House.ldquoThe Prime Minister canrsquot keep pushing Parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny.Only hours before the vote, Mrs May had told Cabinet thatldquocandid legal advice given to ministers must remain confidential, despite a Commons vote last month demanding its publication in ldquofinal and full form.Attorney General Geoffrey Coxinsisted the Government had ldquogone out of its way to satisfy the terms of the humble address to the Queen passed by Parliament on November .Speaking in the Commons after the vote, Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said:ldquoWersquove tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject.ldquoWersquove listened carefully and in light of the expressed will of the House we will publish the final and full advice provided by the Attorney General to Cabinet.Mrs Leadsom has written to the Committee of Privileges

We know No Deal is an option. But as the Prime Minister said herself, No Brexit is also an option, and MPs deserve legal clarity on that.ldquoThey deserve to knowArticle  can be revoked by the unanimous agreement of all  other European states.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that. But reversing for some of us a policy that is supposed to make things fairer for all of us is not the way to do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9129662.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-urges-theresa-may-to-avoid-utterly-disastrous-deal-in-brexit-talks","story":"Scotlands First Minister called for the UKs departure from the European Union to be delayed in order to find a \"workable alternative\" to Mrs Mays Brexit deal, which faces widespread opposition in the Commons.:Nicola Sturgeon rejects idea of Scottish independence without IndyrefBut in talks at Westminster, Mrs May urged the First Minister to listen to Scottish business chiefs and back the deal or risk going back to \"square one\".Ms Sturgeon said: \"I used todays meeting with the Prime Minister to reiterate that it cannot - and must not - be a  choice between her proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous for jobs, business and living standards.\"Instead, there must be a recognition that,the PMs deal is defeated in the Commons as is widely expected, then a workable alternative is urgently needed.\"That means there should be an extension to the Article  process, and we will join with those from other parties in trying to secure such an extension.\"Extending the Article  process would keep the UK in the EU beyond the current March   departure date.:Against the odds: Theresa May begins parliamentary fight of her le to win Brexit Plan voteMs Sturgeon added: \"The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.\"With the UK Governments own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory Party to come together and make a stand.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders - like Sir Ian Wood - who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.\"The Prime Minister urged the First Minister to listen to these voices in their support of the deal as opposed to risking a no-deal Brexit or going back to square one of negotiations.\"The First Ministers visit comes after all parties at Holyrood, except the Conservatives, united to back a motion opposing Mrs Mays Brexit deal.MSPs will vote on the motion at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-why-we-must-know-if-mps-have-the-power-to-revoke-article-50","story":"We expect the case to establish as a matter of legal certainty that Brexit may be stopped by the UK revoking the Article  notice.The fact that the UK Government has fought this case tooth and nail at considerable expense shows how desperate the PM is to prevent MPs having this certainty.:ECJ Advocate General says UK can revoke Article  unilaterallyThe question matters because when MPs vote on whether to raty the Withdrawal Agreement, a vote against ratication could result in a no-deal exit unless there is an alternative.When he referred the case to Luxembourg, Scotlandrsquos top judge said: ldquoThe answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPshellip..Whatever the interest of MSPs and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.\"On that basis the petition is competent at least at the instance of an MP.The case was heard by the Grand Chamber of the Court comprising  judges.Extraordinarily counsel for the UK Government refused to take a position on whether revocation is possible and argued only that the case was inadmissible.:Scotlands Brexit legal bid explained as European court to hear Article  challengeNormally where a partyrsquos primary position is that the court should not entertain the question, a fall-back position would be advanced.Instead the UK government invited the court not to open up a Pandorarsquos box.

MPs will be chosen by the Speaker to make speeches although their seniority - including positions previously held in government - usually influences the running order. A time limit is likely on backbench speeches, with MPs fearing it could be as low as four minutes.It is the decision of the MP speaking on whether they accept interventions from others during their speech.- What does a vote involve MPs walk through ision lobbies - in essence, rooms either side of the Commons chamber known as the ayes and noes.

years the University has recruited only between  and  per cent of students from the  per cent of poorer postcodes areas, referred to as the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation - largely due to the

 per cent of its new undergraduate students this year were from the most deprived parts of Scotland.To help increase this figure, Edinburgh announced it will use this years clearing process to award places to those from deprived areas.The most recent national statistics which are available show that in -, . per cent of Scottish university students came from SIMD areas.Watchdogs want universities to pay less attention to exam results and more to the candidatersquos own experience and potential - so-called ldquocontextualised admissions.This is in response to the view that it is easier for children from affluent backgrounds to get the passes required for some courses because of parental help, private tuition or the culture at particular schools.However, there has been criticism of using SIMD areas as a standard, with Universities Scotland - the body which represents all  of Scotlands educational institutions - saying its was an \"inadequate\" guide when determining whether a student came from a deprived background.Earlier this year, Dr Elisabet Weedon, Deputy Director of the Centre for Research in Education, Inclusion and Diversity at the University of Edinburgh, said that relying on SIMD data posed regional problems and could result in disabled students and care experienced students being excluded.Writing in Holyrood magazine, she said: ldquoTherersquos a danger that

The  census suggests its population is growing faster than the Scottish average. But the proportion of --year-olds is only  per cent. Well below the Scottish average.

So keeping more youngsters in the Highlands is seen as crucial to the regionrsquos sustainability, especially of those areas described as fragile by researchers.The report on the survey, called Enabling Our Next Generation, is not all good news.

Airbnb praised the ldquobeautul but rugged natural splendour of the islands.The report mentioned Airbnb in less flattering light. ldquoDespite the increasing high-profile nature of the housing challenge, stakeholders are not convinced that there has been signicant progress in this area.ldquoAnecdotally there have been suggestions that increased tourism through attractions such as the North Coast  have made the rental market even more challenging as properties are being used as Airbnb holiday lets rather than offering long term leases.The reporter praised the University of Highlands and Islands for its role in keeping youngsters in the region.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Tuesday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmProjects in Graemsay, Wyre, and Evie have all received support from Orkney Islands Council community development fund.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I have sought assurances that the Scottish Government will continue to make every possible effort to assist the workforce of Edinburgh Salmon Company in light of this closure.\"There are fears that some families of Eastern European origin who have contributed to the local economy for upwards of a decade are now considering cutting their losses and leaving the area.\"I know because of this loads of people will go back to Poland,\" said a Polish national who has friends working there. \"Its going to be a dficult time for those people. Some of them have worked there for  years.\"Another member of the Polish community, who also did not want to be named, said: \"My partner used to work there. I feel sorry for my friends and their families. I know how people are feeling, but nobody will speak about it. There are loads of people working there and people are scared.\"In a statement, Europeacuteenne de la Mer, which has cited challenging market conditions and is understood to have registered losses in excess of poundmillion, said it regretted \"no feasible alternative solution to closure was found during collective consultation\" and the factory will close at the end of the year. It will meet its obligations until the turn of the year when the factory will close.It said: \"We would like to thank all employees for their commitment to the company to date and their professionalism during this dficult time.\"Next Fridays jobs fair in Dingwall will run from pm to pm at the Town hall.

In December , the ground shted for Scotland’s private renters with the introduction of the Private Residential Tenancy for all new tenancies alongside a new free-to-access tribunal, set up to resolve disputes between landlords and renters.   The new system was introduced to rebalance the relationship between private renters and their landlords. Shelter Scotland was one of the leading voices in the decade-long campaign for this new type of tenancy. Last year,  per cent of calls to our free housing advice helpline came from private renters – a disproportionate number as privately rented homes represent only  per cent of households in Scotland – many of whom complained of repairs issues and who often felt the balance of power lay squarely with their landlords, given the limited security that the old Short-Assured Tenancy offered.The statistics on private renting show high growth in the sector, which has tripled in size since . Many more people are wanting to rent from private landlords for longer and looking for the additional security that a long-term home provides.This is why Shelter Scotland campaigned for the new tenancy which, we hope, will eventually provide private renters with the stability they want while retaining the flexibility they need. A key change introduced by the new system is the removal of the “no fault” grounds for eviction. Landlords must now provide a tenant with a valid reason should they want the property back – and tenants can now challenge this at the new tribunal,required. : David Alexander: Rental costs pale compared with other essentialsSo far, there is evidence that shows the new tenancy is having a positive impact. Over the past year, we have been running workshops and talking to tenants and landlords and letting agents.One tenant told me that the new rules were giving people back a sense of security. The tenant, who said she is soon to become a landlord herself, said that “at one point it was accepted that you could be born and die in the same home. But for years the lack of secure housing has meant people have been constantly on the move, uprooted from schools, family, support networks”. The removal of fixed-term tenancies for new renters means that people should feel more stable and be able to plan ahead. One tenant who had been renting in central Edinburgh for the last three years talked about her experience of being forced to commit to a rent increase every six months or face looking for a new place to stay, which was stressful. She now has one of the new tenancies which means that rent increases are limited to one every  months – and with three months’ notice. Although she does feel more secure as a result, she still has concerns over how landlords may “try to get around the rules” – such as trying to evict so they can make seasonal ‘killings’ during the Festival season. This is the sort of bad practice the new tenancy hopes to eradicate.: Scottish Labour calls for ‘state intervention’ in private rented sectorAnother tenant had put up with a bad neighbour rather than move, as she knew her existing landlord wouldn’t end her tenancy unexpectedly, but had heard of many other renters being told to move out after their initial six months’ contract ended and so chose to accept the unwanted noise rather than encounter the unknown. The same renter also highlighted, even with the removal of “no fault” evictions, there are still  grounds for eviction that a landlord may use to end a tenancy so there is still an element of uncertainty in private renting.At Shelter Scotland, we believe that over the long-term, the security and stability afforded by the new tenancy will drive up standards in the private rented sector. Some renters talked about their disrepair over experiences before the new rules came in. One renter went without heating or hot water for several weeks because the letting agency didn’t treat a broken boiler as an urgent repair. Under the new tenancy agreement, this tenant could demand the letting agent or landlord act without fear that they might be evicted should they complain.A year on and there is no doubt the legislation has begun to sht the power balance between tenant and landlords towards a more equal footing. There is still a long way to go, not least because far too many private tenants aren’t aware of their new rights and how to enforce them.In my experience of the last year, private tenants are more likely to take issues to the tribunal or contact their landlord or letting agent directly with issues because they feel empowered and more secure under the new system.The tenant who had the faulty boiler  She said it wasn’t just the fear of eviction that stopped her demanding an urgent repair, it was that the agent didn’t respond to her calls. As another client, whose washing machine flooded the kitchen the day after she moved in, put it: “It feels too challenging asking the agency to do things. It took several phone calls to them and then Shelter Scotland to seek advice. It proved incredibly stressful and affected my mental health.” We need more people to tackle bad landlords and letting agents to ensure that private renting genuinely is fit for the st century. The legislation is in place and private residential tenants have greater rights. It is now vital that they are empowered to use them when necessary – the real transformation in private renting will be when they don’t have to.James Mullaney is project officer on Shelter Scotland’s Private Renters’ Voice Project©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow tells mps arguable case contempt committed by government over brexit legal advice","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit backstop could continue indefinitely, Government legal advice suggests Brexit: What do the Government’s legal position papers say  Opposition parties complained, after a fractious two-and-a-half-hour debate, that the summary legal advice released by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox did not comply with a Commons resolution agreed on November . Mr Cox, who is the Governments chief legal adviser, had staunchly defended the decision - telling MPs \"there is nothing to see here\". The Speaker however, in a statement to the Commons, said he was \"satisfied\" the matter should be put before MPs to consider on Tuesday morning. He said: \"The letter that I received from the members mentioned at the start of this statement asks me to give precedence to a motion relating to privilege in relation to the failure of ministers to comply with the terms of the resolution of the House of the  November.\" Mr Bercow stopped his statement to scold Government chief whip Julian Smith, who was talking to ministers on the frontbench, saying: \"It would seem courteoushe could just hold off for a moment and allow me to make the statement that would appear to show perhaps a proper politeness.\" He added: \"I have considered the matter carefully and I am satisfied that there is an arguable case that a contempt has been committed. Im therefore giving precedence for a motion to be tabled tonight before the House rises and to be taken as first business tomorrow.\" Mr Bercow said it was \"entirely for the House to decide on that motion\". The Attorney General earlier said that he \"fully accepts\" MPs may impose a sanction against him or the Government for contempt of Parliament over Brexit legal advice. He said: \"The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will. \"It can bring a motion of contempt and seek to have that motion passed and seek to impose through the committee, or whichever way it is appropriately done, to impose a sanction. I fully accept that. \"I dont set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.\" Mr Cox had asked MPs to suppose the advice included details on relationships with foreign states and arguments that might be deployed in the future, noting: \"Would it be right for the Attorney General, regardless of the harm to the public interest, to ulge his opinion. \"I say it wouldnt.\" Mr Cox said it would be dficult to ensure information would be redacted, adding: \"I cannot take a step that I firmly and truly believe would be contrary to the public interest\". He went on: \"I ask the House to understand that it is only that consideration that is motivating me and this Government in declining at this stage to break the convention that applies to both sides of the House when they are in government. \"There is nothing to see here.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit legal advice to emerge after ministers found in contempt of parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

down to its third defeat in the space of an hour as MPs backed a move which could put Parliament in the driving seatthe Brexit deal is rejected on December .If her deal falls in the “meaningful vote” next week, the PM has  calendar days to set out a statement on her next steps.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve’s amendment will make any such statement itself amendable, meaning that MPs can

could open the door for the Commons to throw its weight behind a Norway-style soft Brexit, or even a second EU referendum, though prominent Leave-backing MPs questioned whether any such vote would be binding on ministers.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that the finding of contempt was “a badge of shame” for the Government, with “huge constitutional and political signicance”.It is the first time in modern history that a Government has been found in contempt of Parliament.“It is highly regrettable that the Government has let it come to this, but ministers left the opposition with no option but to bring forward these proceedings,” said Sir Keir.“By treating Parliament with contempt, the Government has proved it has lost its majority and the respect of the

“gone out of its way” to satisfy the terms of the humble address to the Queen passed by Parliament on November .Speaking in the Commons after the vote, Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom

parliamentarians.Mrs May’s official spokesman told reporters in Westminster that “this is not a final judgment”, adding: “It does nothing in any event to change the clear position of the Government that Article  is not going to be revoked.”Meanwhile, Mr Carney stepped up his warnings about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit.He told the Commons Treasury Committee that increased tarf prices, import costs and a collapse in the value of the pound would send food prices soaring “quite quickly”.In the most extreme no-deal scenario, shopping bills could rise by up to % but even in an orderly

the fight with a speech in the Commons at the start of five days of debate on the package.Over the coming days she will deploy senior Cabinet ministers to make the case, with Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid expected to appear at the despatch box.Mrs May will tell MPs: “The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the

Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"may and corbyn in blame game as prospect of brexit tv debate recedes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

in blame game as prospect of Brexit TV debate recedesBelfastDowning Street accused Jeremy Corbyn of “running scared” from a TV debate with Theresa May after the BBC dropped plans to host it.https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk may-and-corbyn-in-blame-game-as-prospect-of-brexit-tv-debate-recedes-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece cdad AUTOCROP h bpanews_e--bdb-b-add_EmailDowning Street accused Jeremy Corbyn of “running scared” from a TV debate with Theresa May after the BBC dropped plans to host it..pushThe broadcaster said it was “disappointed” not to have reached an agreement on the proposal for a debate involving the two leaders, saying it wanted the programme to include other voices.Labour and the Government had been at loggerheads over whether to accept the BBC proposal, which was favoured by Downing Street, or that of a straight head-to-head on ITV, which Mr Corbyn’s party prefers.Downing Street blamed Labour for raising “ and flimsy objections” to the BBC’s proposed format.But a senior Labour source said the party’s message to Mrs May was “come and join us on ITV”.A debate between the party leaders had been pencilled in for December , just two days before MPs are due to vote on Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement.In a statement, the BBC said: “We are disappointed that we could not reach an agreement on the BBC’s proposal for a debate on Brexit.“We have been clear throughout the whole of this process that, as well as a substantive head-to-head debate, any programme we broadcast would need to include other voices, including other political parties, to reflect the wide range of views the public and parliamentarians hold about Brexit.BBC statement on Brexit TV debate pic Ankuisse— BBC News Press TeamDecember , “The final proposal we put to both of the main parties was for a head-to-head debate between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, followed by a discussion between eight lists, including politicians, with a wide range of views on Brexit, and ending with further head-to-head debate and closing statements.“We believe ours was a fair and appropriate format for those taking part and, crucially, for our audiences around the country, and it is a shame we will not be able to bring them this programme.”The BBC statement came hours after Labour said the corporation’s proposal was a “mishmash” with “a lopsided  of other politicians and public figures, not a straightforward head-to-head debate”.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head-to-head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise  and flimsy objections to the BBC’s proposal.“There was a sensible and balanced proposal on the table but Jeremy Corbyn refused to take part.“He is running scared of proper scrutiny, but we remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head.”On Monday, the Prime Minister expressed concern that holding the debate on ITV would mean she missed Strictly Come Dancing.Well, @jeremycorbyn may not want to miss the @imacelebrity final, but it’s all about @bbcstrictly for Prime Minister @theresa_may… #BBCorITV #Brexit pic JxZJFRStq— This Morning🎄December , Mr Corbyn last week complained on This Morning that the BBC’s proposal would clash with jungle-based reality show I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!ITV stressed that “invitations remain open” to both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to appear in a debate on the channel.“As always, it is up to those invited to decide whether they want to accept the invitation,” a spokesman said.Meanwhile, the Commons will consider calls led by Sky News for an independent commission to arrange leaders’ debates during general election campaigns.A petition has been signed by more than , people calling for a commission to take decision-making out of the politicians’ and broadcasters’ hands and ensure TV debates become a regular fixture of UK elections.The debate will take place on January , but the Government has already said TV showdowns are a matter for political parties and it has no plans to change electoral law to make them mandatory."},{"url":null,"title":"couple who lost

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

He brought a strong and successful vision to the school, and one that remains today mdash to build a school with a strong family focus where children enjoy learning and are given the very best chance in the classrooms and in every sphere of the schoolrsquos influence.Many improvements to the school fabric and structure were also made, while several temporary classrooms were added in an attempt to satisfy the increased demand for pupil places.When Mr Mills retired in June , work was about to begin on a signicant new extension to the existing school buildings.Ms Vivien Watt became principal the following September and her first task was to oversee the building project, which was a huge undertaking. She worked resolutely to ensure that the school had the best facilities possible.The new extension was opened in September, , and the demand for places continued to grow.In , the school had a full inspection and in every area inspected, the school was either classied as lsquovery goodrsquo or lsquooutstandingrsquo mdash a testament to the hard work, skill and dedication of every member of staff.A new sports hall, with accompanying reception area, was opened in February  by the then Education Minister, John OrsquoDowd, and has since been officially named the Vivien Watt Sports Hall.Following Ms Wattrsquos retirement in January , Miss Hynds mdash then vice-principal mdash was appointed principal.She led the school through a Sustaining Improvement Inspection in June , in which the school achieved the highest possible grading and this summer the whole staff were rewarded by one of the highest sets of results ever achieved.The schoolrsquos th celebrations for the current year began with a hugely successful community coffee morning in September, followed by a formal dinner earlier this month which was attended by past and current members of staff, both teaching and non-teaching, including previous principals Mr Mills and Ms Watt.A community iety show is also planned for later on in the school year.Miss Hynds said: ldquoWe are a very traditional school with family values, she says. ldquoWe are respecting the past, as that is our firm foundation, but we are also looking to the future.ldquoThe school prides itself on the teamwork that operates between members of staff, students, parents and carers, and members of the community.ldquoEffective collaboration to further improve outcomes for all of the boys and girls is at the very heart of the schoolrsquos vision for the future.ldquoSaintfield High School is certainly fulfilling its vision statement for - mdash lsquoTo achieve and celebrate inidual excellence through effective collaboration and care as a community focused schoolrsquo.ldquoIt is clear that this is a school firmly endorsed by our wider community, and one that is continuing to grow from strength to strength..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac selected to represent Ireland in EU Parliament  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK student will be speaking in the European Parliament next year.Cormac Savage, a Year  student at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, has been selected as one of  young people chosen to represent Ireland in the EU Parliament in Strasbourg in February.He will be going there as part of Euroscola mdash a scheme in which young people from all EU member states become Members of European Parliament for the day and debate and vote from within the chamber.The programme in Ireland is run by the Rotary Club and is called the Youth Development Leadership competition.Cormac, who is a member of the UK Youth Parliament, was selected by Comber Rotary Club.He said it was an ldquohonour to be chosen to represent Ireland on the European stage.He thanked Mr Crosby McVeigh, a member of Comber Rotary Club, who organised and coordinated the Rotary Club of Comber heat and selection process.Cormac will leaves for Strasbourg and on February  and willfive days later.He is following the footsteps of Teirnan Laird, from Down High School, last yearrsquos Comber Rotary winner, who went on to win the overall prize at Euroscola  in Strasbourg last spring.Meanwhile, there were more celebrations for Comber Rotary Club when Aaron Blaine, a pupil at Killinchy Primary School, won the All-Ireland young writer competition.Aaron chose as his topic lsquoA Dream that Changed Everythingrsquo ndash a story about a fox and a man called Ron.One of the judges, Kathryn Torney described Aaronrsquos story as ldquoenergetic, thoughtful and extremely well written, while Meg Healey, Rotary District Youth Chairperson, looked forward to seeing his name in the bookshops with a best seller as he has a bright future ahead of him..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar pet Pedro is purr fect for cat pageant  ","story":"A CROSSGAR cat has been strutting his fluff on the red carpet after being short-listed for a prestigious kitty pageant.Pedro has been selected as a finalist in the Crown Your Cat competition organised by Mackle Petfoods.Eighteen month-old Pedro, an American Maine Coon, is owned by Ciara Fullam, who is delighted with her furry felinersquos success.Ciararsquos certain that Pedro was the lsquopurr-fectrsquo Christmas present when she got him in Tipperary last December.ldquoPedro is no ordinary cat, she says: ldquoI had always wanted a Maine Coon because they are known to be a hardy breed.ldquoI saw a picture of Pedro, then a kitten.

He does love company but is happy enough to just watch you most of the time from a distance.ldquoAnd hersquos not afraid of water either. Enjoying a nice warm bath when the notion takes him and jumping into the river on occasion to go for a swim is often on his to-do list when the weather is good.But Pedro comes alive when the weather is at its worst. ldquoHis breed hails from the state of Maine in the USA, Ciara explained. ldquoThey are larger than your average cat and bred to survive severe weather conditions.

It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Can the government get some changes to the agreement and then bring it back to parliament and get it through “The key change they would need would be to take out the bit of the agreement which says we can’t get out of the backstop. They already have a paragraph drafted which never went to the EU, but it basically says the UK can leave the backstopthey find it unsatisfactory.“I suspect that’s what the government will try, but this is going to be very dficult, because particularly Dublin has been saying for two years they won’t accept any backstop which isn’t permanent.“Dublin is just desperate to lock Northern Ireland into this agreement, which I think is something of a slow stairway to a united Ireland and I think they would regard it as one stepping stone in that direction. And having got the deal now they are not going to let it go without one hell of a fight.”Voicing his party’s concerns in the House of Commons, North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds described the withdrawal agreement as “deeply unattractive and unsatisfactory” and said the Attorney General should be recommending that it be rejected.With the government having repeatedly refused to publish the legal advice it received on Brexit in full, Mr Dodds later revealed that the speaker of the House of Commons has been asked to launch proceedings of contempt.“We have now written to the Speaker to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt. Parliament can not be ignored,” he tweeted.Meanwhile, the Secretary of State has claimed the people of Northern Ireland “want the government to get on with it” and deliver the best possible withdrawal deal.People want us to get on with Brexit, says NI Secretary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Karen Bradley has been travelling around the Province over the past couple of weeks campaigning in support of Mrs May’s proposed agreement.try catch     .               ..

Born the son of Delia and Andy  years ago in Black’s Court Lurgan, Joe was the third generation of an Italian family who came here in the early th century.Fr McConville said: “They integrated into the community through business, primarily their restaurant and ice-cream parlour which was a feature of Lurgan and known across the country.”He spoke of Joe meeting and marrying the love of his le, Angela O’Hagan, and the couple’s two children Lisa and Maria. And the family grew with Brian Lennon coming into the family and the birth of the grandchildren Delia, Meabh and Niall.“Joe had great love for them and loved to be in their company. He was a great family man.”A packed St Paul’s Church heard the priest say there that many facets to Joe - the question was ‘where do you start’.“History is peppered with characters and some characters are larger than le, some characters can be legends and myths. Cafollas are part of the history of this town and Joe is part of that history.“Joe was a constant figure there in Cafollas. Going into the Carnegie St cafe was always great craic, particularly with the two characters Joe and Brendan Gilmore who could have taken the mickey out of you. The two of them worked together for  years.Joe was a very generous soul and the priest spoke of how he had sometimes gone to Cafollas and Joe would insist on giving him a tub of his famous ice cream. “Many people experienced Joe’s generosity over the years,” he said.\"  \"  School children witness fatal shooting of man outside N.I. school Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He spoke of how Angela introduced Joe to Clann na Gael and he became a regular at matches and post match celebrations, singing a few songs, messing about and tomfoolery’.“Joe loved sports, soccer, football, clay pigeon-shooting and he did a bit of horse-riding. He was always involved in a lot of sports.“I remember Joe over  years ago in the LCA . Joe loved to play snooker. He was always great fun. He also loved boxing and trips to Las Vegas,” said Fr McConville.“Joe was always great company to be in. You always had a great commentary, great camaraderie and great comedy.“With some peopleyou are in their company they could drain you. That certainly was not the case with Joe Cafolla.“Joe gave you le and energy because he was full of le himself, such a jovial character. He energised you and lted you up. He was a great guy to be in his company.“Joe had a great love of le and for his family. Joe was a larger than le character. He was a bit of a showman,” he said recalling stories of Joe and his unusual tactics playing snooker.“One thing everyone says about Joe, he was a kind and he was one of a kind.”His passing is very deeply regretted by his loving we, Angela, daughters, Maria and Lisa son-in-law, Brian, grandchildren, Delia, Meabh and Niall, Maria’s partner Aidy and family circle.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

votes to .The humiliating ision came shortly before Prime Minister Theresa May was due to open a five-day debate on her deal, amid widespread expectation that her proposals are set for rejection by MPs.Minutes after the historic contempt vote, the Government went down to its third defeat in the space of an hour as MPs backed a move which could put Parliament in the driving seatthe Brexit deal is rejected on December .If her deal falls in the ldquomeaningful vote next week, the PM has  calendar days to set out a statement on her next steps.Former attorney general Dominic Grieversquos amendment will make any such statement itself amendable, meaning that MPs can effectively direct the Government on how to respond to the defeat of Mrs Mayrsquos plans.The House of Commons found the Government in contempt by a margin of  to  This could open the door for the Commons to throw its weight behind a Norway-style soft Brexit, or even a second EU referendum, though prominent Leave-backing MPs questioned whether any such vote would be binding on ministers.Labourrsquos shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that the finding of contempt was ldquoa badge of shame for the Government, with ldquohuge constitutional and political signicance.It is the first time in modern history that a Government has been found in contempt of Parliament.ldquoIt is highly regrettable that the Government has let it come to this, but ministers left the opposition with no option but to bring forward these proceedings, said Sir Keir.ldquoBy treating Parliament with contempt, the Government has proved it has lost its majority and the respect of the House.ldquoThe Prime Minister canrsquot keep pushing Parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny.Only hours before the vote, Mrs May had told Cabinet thatldquocandid legal advice given to ministers must remain confidential, despite a Commons vote last month demanding its publication in ldquofinal and full form.Attorney General Geoffrey Coxinsisted the Government had ldquogone out of its way to satisfy the terms of the humble address to the Queen passed by Parliament on November .Speaking in the Commons after the vote, Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said:ldquoWersquove tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject.ldquoWersquove listened carefully and in light of the expressed will of the House we will publish the final and full advice provided by the Attorney General to Cabinet.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox Mrs Leadsom has written to the Committee of Privileges watchdog, calling for an inquiry into the use of the humble address procedure, which had fallen out of use since the th century but has been revived by Labour to inflict a number of binding defeats on the Government.The constitutional row

Burnt out houses remain un-cleared sitting beside those that are still inhabited creating an atmosphere of dereliction and a breeding ground for rats and other vermin. Walkaways between houses have not been cleaned and neither have communal car parking areas.“Houses are in a poor state of repair with garden fences rotting and broken and window frames that have not been upgraded and are beginning to rot. Where it is clear some of these homes are private dwellings the question needs to be askedthere is any form of grant available to those occupants andso what efforts have been made to ensure they know about them.A derelict part of Craigavon“Without a doubt Legahory Court and Burnside are some of the most deprived areas not only in Central Craigavon but throughout the whole of Upper Bann. Those that live there must feel that they have been forgotten by the authorities and dare I say it politicians. If this situation was in central Lurgan, Portadown or Banbridge there would be an outcry from local civic leaders and community groups that would enable change, yet Legahory Court and Burnside remain forgotten, derelict and in need of serious investment. “As more and more money is invested in Craigavon improving the wealth and lives of all those in the area through jobs and wellbeing it is important that the ink spot of investment reaches these deprived areas. In calling for an urgent meeting of those responsible for this area I want to see something that will fundamentally change this area in the medium to long term.”Kate Evans said: “I have never seen anywhere in the local area in such a bad state of repair as I did while walking around Legahory Court and Burnside. As a mother I would have real concern letting my daughter out to playI resided there and genuinely believe that the poor state of some of the homes leaves the places looking like a slum. Yet nomore than  meters away millions of pounds is being spent on infrastructure projectsto improve the aesthetics of central Craigavon, to help with health, wellbeing, job opportunities and a better standard of living for the whole area.”Parts of Craigavon are poorly maintained says UUP MLA Doug Beattie£.m boost to deal with winter ailments Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
