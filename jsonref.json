I was incredulous when I got that response.‘The report said it was “highly unlikely” it was contaminated during the manufacturing process. It might well be very unlikely but it happened, it’s come from somewhere.’Chrissie added: ‘I don’t even like kale, I just eat it because it’s healthy.’The packet of kale Chrissie Gilbert bought (Picture: Mercury)An Emmett UK spokesperson said: ‘Every day we harvest, shred (using a four blade slicer) then sieve and thoroughly wash and pack 40,000 bags of kale.‘To ensure that the kale reaches the customer in excellent condition there are multiple stringent quality control checks throughout.‘This process involves the extremely thorough automated washing, drying and packing of the kale into bags which are then sealed by machine.‘During the process optical graders are also used to help detect foreign objects.‘We take customer feedback very seriously and as soon as we were made aware of the complaint we initiated a full investigation.‘From this we concluded that the item could not have survived our rigorous quality processes.Boy, 4, copied GoCompare monster and ate cash after watching advertA Tesco spokesperson said: ‘We have extremely high standards for the products we put on our shelves, and our growers work hard to inspect our salads carefully.‘Our supplier has investigated this case fully and found that this foreign object would not have remained unidentified or survived the harvesting, washing and slicing processes the product goes through before the bag is sealed.‘We are sorry if Mrs Gilbert is not happy with the conclusion of the investigation, we would be very happy to discuss this with her further if she wishes.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_6365343.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"ant mcpartlin wont back screen next year says stephen mulhern","story":"Ant McPartlin has stepped down from his TV commitments (Picture: Getty Images)Britain’s Got More Talent host Stephen Mulhern thinks Ant McPartlin should be back on our screens ‘next year’.Ant will not be hosting the Britain’s Got Talent live shows next month after he was charged with drink driving.

(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for )Next time you’re on a late-night, long haul flight, keep your eyes and ears open.Especially if it’s a Boeing 747.And it doesn’t have to be with someone you know, either. Nearly a third of those who had already enjoyed sex on a plane hooked up with a complete stranger.By coincidence, I myself am getting on a plane today — with no plans for a toilet quickie, I might add — and ahead of my trip, asked members of the mile high club to tell me about their experiences.Prepare yourself — this is raunchy stuff.One of the stewardesses and I had been eyeing each other since the moment I stepped onto the plane.While the majority of the passengers were asleep, she snuck me into the kitchen area and we had sex while her co-worker kept watch.I overheard a woman a few seats behind me, as she was talking to someone on the phone. She mentioned the mile high club and how she’d be so nervous to do it.I turned and smiled at her, and she blushed.A few minutes went by and I decided to go to the bathroom. On the way, I gave her a nod.I waited inside for a few minutes, but figured she wasn’t coming. But, when I opened the door, she was standing there looking down at the floor.I pulled her towards me and slid the door shut.I caught her playing with herself, while everyone was asleep.So, we got down and it was really hot, and fun.My girlfriend and I had sex in the toilets.Just as we were ready to get out, after about five minutes of anal sex, a flight attendant knocked and told us to return to our seats.She didn’t say anything else at the time, but at the gate, she pulled me aside and said never to do it again.We were caught by the stewardess. She was about 60 and just sort of smirked at us.It was amazing. This stranger f**ked me rough.Although it was only for 30 minutes, we did pretty much everything.We had loads of fun but were caught by a passenger who heard me cum.I was next to this hot guy on a plane headed to Dubai.As I sat down, I immediately noticed his big penis. I guess he was quite erect.I couldn’t help but stare, got a bit horny and started rubbing my legs together. After a few minutes, the guy asked if there was something wrong and if he could help me with anything.I just stared at him and glanced at his bulky cock.We did it on the seats.I was a steward, and the pilot was so hot, I got an erection.The girl sitting next to me was very nervous. During take-off, she just grabbed my hand.Then, every time we hit turbulence, she got closer, gripping me tighter.Eventually, I just pulled her in for a kiss, and things got hot and heavy fast.I was coming home from the army.We started making out, and went into the bathroom. We almost ripped each other’s clothes off, and went at it like wild animals but stayed as quiet as possible.When we landed in New York, we decided we wanted more. So, we checked into a motel for three days.After that, she caught her flight to L.A., I caught mine to Chicago, and we never saw each other again.I thought about her for years, but I guess it’s just the way it goes sometimes.The stewardess invited me up to first class, and seduced me.I’d seen this guy ogling me.We had sex standing up in the toilet. It was fun, but uncomfortable and a little awkward.I’ve met up with him since, too.Managed to get three seats for the two of us.After a warm-up under the blankets, we pretended to go to sleep and ended up having sex.If you liked this story you should give our new sex podcast Good Sex Bad Sex a listen – it’s out every Wednesday.The show is available now on iTunes here and on Soundcloud here. bloggers Miranda Kane and Bibi Lynch co-host the show, chatting to a different guest about all things sex and relationships each week.Think good cop bad cop – but with more handcuff action.You can also follow the show on Twitter here.MORE: A beginner’s guide to finding a mistress: my joy comes from being in controlMORE: Good Sex Bad Sex podcast: We talk ethical, erotic porn with Anna RichardsMORE: ‘Butt plugs, whips and vibrators’: 12 people reveal what’s in their goodie drawers"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/18/4B77748900000578-5646889-image-m-50_1524502857003.jpg","title":"Duchess Cambridge safely gives birth boy","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/19/4B77B35800000578-0-image-m-181_1524507867432.jpg","title":"ARTHUR favourite newborn prince bookies paying Royal nod legendary king","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

Only a quarter of middle earners aged between 25 and 34 now own a property, compared to two-thirds in 1995, according to official figures. And a Resolution Foundation report this month claimed a third of millennials could still be renting in retirement.Pensioners stuck in debt and parents helping their children...A £111 penalty if you refuse a smart meter: British Gas, EDF...TSB meltdown: Locked out of your account?

The lack of supply is pushing up prices, leaving young families struggling to get on the ladder.The Government believes that building 300,000 homes a year in England by 2025 is the answer and has ordered local authorities to outline suitable locations.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May warned that if councils don\u0027t build enough houses they will lose their right to determine where they are placed. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, told them he\u0027d be \u0027breathing down their neck\u0027.But Britain\u0027s latest housebuilding drive has led to fierce debates within communities about where these properties should go. At one extreme are the Nimbys (Not In My Back Yard) who don\u0027t want any housebuilding in their neighbourhood for fear the construction would ruin their views and be too noisy.At the other you have a new breed of campaigners nicknamed \u0027Yimbys\u0027 (Yes In My Back Yard) who want housing to help their children and grandchildren raise families.The majority sit somewhere between, pushed and pulled by these factions.          Against: Anna Martin, pictured with daughters Iona (centre) and Annabel, walks and jogs in the woods most days of the weekEastleigh, which must build 14,580 new homes by 2036, is a prime example of the new dynamic. It was one of 15 councils shamed last year for being too slow to put a plan in place. Now the council has revealed a proposal to build nearly 2,000 more homes than required.It has sparked uproar among the residents guiding me around the area. They\u0027re concerned that one in three houses is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood, and the idea of a road through the middle appals them.They tell me one Yimby is pushing this development more than anyone else — Keith House. The Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, who has held that role for more than 20 years, claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxes.\u0027It has been known and accepted for years that we need to build more homes in the right places,\u0027 he says. \u0027While this shift from buying to renting is fine in London and other big cities, there isn\u0027t the stock in the suburbs and on the South coast.\u0027There is a change of tone in the housing debate as people realise that it\u0027s their sons and daughters who can\u0027t afford homes.\u0027It\u0027s clear why families would want to live in a location such as this. You\u0027d have rural Hampshire on your doorstep while being a 30-minute drive from Southampton and within commuting distance of London.And Mr House is adamant he can deliver the schools, roads and other facilities that will be needed here.\u0027All too often councils put the houses up first and then fail to deliver on the infrastructure,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027re committed to putting that in — it\u0027s in the plans.\u0027          Lib Dem councillor Keith House claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxesBut resident Bruce Mitchell, 55, a civil servant, accuses Mr House of ignoring overwhelming opposition. More than 30 people, including environmental experts and charities, spoke against the proposals at a meeting in December that ran on until after 1am, he says.The mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors have quit the Lib Dems over the plans, to run as independents. Even Eastleigh\u0027s Tory MP, Mims Davies, says the move was \u0027panicked and rushed\u0027.Helen Kerris Shaw, 39, who runs an animal charity where the development will be, says: \u0027I\u0027ve volunteered at the charity since I was nine and it\u0027s quite shocking to think it might all be bulldozed over.\u0027Anne Martin, 46, who walks and jogs in the woods most days of the week, says Mr House isn\u0027t thinking about the quality of life in the area.\u0027There are very few places you can go and have such quietness,\u0027 she says. \u0027It is just so short-sighted.\u0027Anne\u0027s daughter Iona, 11, who was highly commended in the British Wildlife Photography Awards, says the road will be like a \u0027Berlin Wall\u0027 for animals which live in the woods.According to the Woodland Trust, just 2 per cent of the UK is ancient woodland which has existed since records began in 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland.Jack Taylor, of the Woodland Trust, says light and road pollution are major threats to wildlife that rarely get mentioned. \u0027These woodlands could be saved with thoughtful design, and people in Eastleigh are right to be alarmed,\u0027 he says.Environmentalists are also concerned that the new road will damage the nearby Itchen river, which has European Special Area of Conservation status. TV naturalist Chris Packham, who grew up in nearby Southampton, has described the plan as \u0027eco-vandalism\u0027.Kate Beal-Blyth, 40, is a member of local action group Action Against Destructive Development.She\u0027s lived in Eastleigh most of her life, running a television production company, and says the group recognises the need to build but says that, with a new railway station and motorway junction, these could be nearer the centre of the borough.          Green belt: One in three houses in the Eastleigh development is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood\u0027We desperately need new homes — they are just being built in the wrong place,\u0027 she says. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, there is space on brownfield land — which has previously been developed — to build one million homes around the country. Many sites already have planning permission so homes can go up straight away, the group says.But PricedOut, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder, says that won\u0027t be enough. It claims much of the green belt isn\u0027t as beautiful as people think — and banning new-builds prevents people from living near work.Mr House agrees. \u0027Every time we have had major development there is inevitable local opposition,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in this case, there is no alternative solution closer to the town centre with the right infrastructure.\u0027Mr House insists he wants to protect the woodland and says the council is not building more homes than Eastleigh needs, as the plan takes into account long-term trends. He says 35 per cent will be affordable housing, with a mix of different property types.          Kate Beal-Blyth is a member of Action Against Destructive DevelopmentSome communities may be able to avoid the sort of disputes that are splitting opinion in Eastleigh.One idea gaining popularity is to fill empty homes before building new ones. More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for at least ten years, according to the Liberal Democrats. About 216,000 have been empty for six months. The Government announced last November that it would allow councils to charge double tax on properties that have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.The Intergenerational Foundation think tank says the Government should focus on filling empty rooms in homes. There are 25 million spare bedrooms in England, it says, adding that many houses are owned by empty-nest pensioners in family-sized houses.For many the costs of downsizing — estimated by Money Mail last year at £29,000 on average — are too off-putting. Experts such as John Godfrey, Theresa May\u0027s former head of policy, say a stamp duty tax break for downsizers could free up these properties for growing families.Mrs May has also suggested former shops could be turned into homes as more people buy online. She says Britain should look to build up as well as out — which could mean using spaces above shops, too.The Prime Minister plans to relax planning rules so people can add two more floors to many properties.Some experts have even suggested building above car parks. Property agency JLL says it has identified 868 car parks within a mile of a station in London that could support an average of 90 homes each. Another concept gaining popularity is the prefab home. These houses are fabricated in factories in as little as 20 days.           Picturesque: The River Itchen which borders the proposed development is one of the world\u0027s most exclusive fishing areasThey are then transported to the necessary location where they take just a few hours to erect. The benefit would be building more homes more quickly, limiting the disruption and noise that cause concern to many Nimbys.The Government hopes that garden towns — whole towns and villages built in commuter belt territory — will also provide room for thousands more homes. Some 14 developments were approved last year from Cornwall to Cumbria. Five in the corridor between Oxford and Cambridge are in the pipeline.Mrs May says she\u0027s working to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Plus there will be a crackdown on developers who sit on land and wait for its value to rise to maximise profits.Yet for residents in areas such as Eastleigh, where councils are under pressure to build thousands of homes right now, these alternatives are emerging too late.Unless enough people back an affordable, sustainable alternative — and win over councillors whose reputations are on the line — campaigners may be fighting a losing battle.It could mean some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful rural areas, whether the locals like it or not, change irrevocably. And as Eastleigh\u0027s 11-year-old photography star Iona Martin is at pains to tell me, that\u0027s causing a great deal of heartache.v.bischoff@dailymail.co.ukOne year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/19/4B6F97E400000578-0-image-a-8_1524422178727.jpg","title":"Man Southwest passenger speaks horror flight","story":"Eric Zilbert, 60, was sitting in front of Jennifer Riordan when the upper half of her body was sucked out of the Southwest Airlines plane last Tuesday\u0027Just this sucking sound. Like being inside a balloon when it deflates,\u0027 he told The Sacramento Bee of the moment. Once he realized what had happened, Riordan was dead, he said. He tried to remain calm on the plane and reassured others around him that they would make it down safely. Southwest Airlines reveals flights will be delayed or...Husband of bank executive who was killed on Southwest flight...Share this articleA self-proclaimed aviation buff, Zilbert, like others who survived the ordeal, said pilot Tammie Jo Shults had a good handle on the plane. \u0027The plane is flying.

Lewis says he knows of one woman who lost £100,000 in a scam which temporarily had attached his name to the product to give it credibility.Facebook’s failure to banish such adverts highlights its ‘unending greed’, he says.He repeatedly asked Facebook to remove the adverts, he claims, but they were left online for days or weeks. And when they were taken down, another one, almost identical, would appear in its place.And this, surely is the point. Time and again, iniduals, politicians, business leaders and the police have asked the web giants to mend their ways. But they are ignored.

Nothing happened.‘The fact that they have yet to respond or take them down means they’re helping criminals,’ he surmised.The trouble is that, at every turn, the web giants seem to prefer to help criminals rather than inconvenience themselves by limiting untrammelled access on the web.It required years of enormous media and political pressure to persuade the digital giants and computer manufacturers to make even the slightest concessions towards blocking access to the most vile forms of online child pornography.Despite incessant demands from the police and politicians to prevent terrorist recruitment online, Islamic State and other militant groups around the world are still connecting with each other, accessing bomb-making advice or buying detonators and other equipment to commit acts of violence.And, of course, the abuse is not confined to crime.Many of us have suspected it for years, but the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how cynically and blatantly our personal data is harvested for commercial purposes without permission.Facebook and other social media sites such as WhatsApp (bought by Facebook for £11 billion in 2014) ruthlessly pillage our communications with friends and family to understand our likes and dislikes and pass data to advertisers.What is so amoral about the behaviour of the web giants is that, despite their endless protestations that they cannot control activity on the web, the reverse is the case.The same technological brainpower the FANGs use to take personal data and make us fodder for their greed could be directed towards curbing the criminal and intrusive behaviour they facilitate. The trouble is that these Silicon Valley giants are now so unimaginably wealthy, have such clout and so much job-creating capacity, that they can ignore the demands of politicians and policy-makers all over the world.Twenty North American cities — from Toronto in Canada to Austin, Texas — are currently engaged, for example, in a tawdry battle to be home to a second vast technological headquarters for Amazon.With the promise of $5 billion of investment to create 50,000 jobs, local politicians are falling over themselves to woo the web giant — and in such circumstances, who would dare raise the issues of tighter regulation or stricter taxation rules? Likewise, in Britain an open-door policy for Google at No 10 when David Cameron was Prime Minister almost certainly helped persuade the company to build magnificent European offices at King’s Cross in London which will eventually employ up to 9,000 people.Is it any wonder, therefore, that it has taken HMRC so long to get its teeth into alleged tax avoidance by the company and others like it?The extraordinary economic firepower which makes each of the digital giants unassailable has just been quantified by the International Monetary Fund. In 2017, sales of smartphones, the device of choice for online access, reached 1.5 billion units or one for every fifth person on Earth. Indeed, smartphones accounted for one-sixth of total world trade last year.Amazingly in Ireland, where Apple houses its intellectual property (the patents and know-how behind the iPhone), exports related to the phone accounted for one-quarter of the country’s economic expansion last year.That is why the Irish government objected when the European Commission — one of the few institutions trying to take on the web giants — gave Apple a £11.2 billion tax bill.So far, American politicians, like our own, have failed to show steel in the face of companies which, in their search for profits, have gone rogue, abandoning any pretence at ethical business practices.But there is a precedent for doing so.In the late 19th century, there was a giant company which the whole world thought was unassailable, so big and powerful was its size, scope and virtual monopoly. At the time, J. D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled 90 per cent of the U.S. oil market.Critics accused Rockefeller of engaging in unethical practices, such as predatory pricing and colluding with railroads to eliminate his competitors.But the U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt had the resolve to take it on. He used legislation to break it up into 34 separate companies and reduce its monopoly power.If only today’s policy-makers had the same gumption. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/21/4B7873C500000578-0-image-m-52_1524514421607.jpg","title":"Todays Mac Cartoon","story":"    ‘Really?

We won Wales In Bloom last year, but I don’t think we’ll be winning it again this year.’ An additional problem is that the shaggy goats carry parasites. ‘Last year we had twenty instances of children with ticks,’ he said.‘This summer we’re going to have many more because the goats have been on the school field – sunbathing and lounging among the plants.’In February, the Royal Welch Fusiliers tried to capture a kid from the herd to use as a mascot. It gave them the slip but was caught a month later.

He said there were no legal grounds for blocking the deal.But a string of MPs urged him to change the law to prevent further ‘predators’ snapping up key British firms.Hedge funds bought up 25 per cent of GKN’s shares in a few weeks to help force through the takeover, helping seal a deal that was approved by a margin of 52 to 48.Tory MP Lucy Allan said the future of GKN was ‘determined by speculators who came on to the share register in the final weeks of the bid process to make a quick profit’.She said this was ‘no way to determine the future of a great British manufacturing company’ and called for a review of takeover rules.Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chairman of the Commons business committee, asked the Government to ‘look again at the takeover code, particularly for businesses so integral to our industrial strategy and for businesses that have received a lot of taxpayer funding’.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the role of hedge funds had been ‘highly destabilising’. He suggested shareholders should be forced to wait a certain period before qualifying for a vote.Mr Clark said he was open to looking at takeover rules again, but suggested he thought they were working well. He also suggested hedge funds would have been unable to snap up shares if long-term investors had had more confidence in GKN’s management.Melrose has previously said it was willing to make a ‘legally-binding’ commitment not to sell GKN’s aerospace ision before April 2023.For a period of five years, Melrose will keep its headquarters in the UK and its shares listed on the stock market in London. It will also ensure the majority of its directors live in the UK.Melrose will also ensure that spending on research and development at GKN will equal at least 2.2 per cent of GKN sales every year up to 2023.Comment – Page 16 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/02/1701902100000514-5654003-image-a-65_1524618193381.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament","story":"    Labour MP Mary Creagh, pictured, is the head of the nannyish environment audit select committeeAfter that hot weekend, MPs discussed heatwaves. The session was arranged by the environmental audit select committee. This nannyish group is chaired by Labour’s Mary Creagh, who first made her name at Westminster by worrying about the temperature of bath water.Pleasant but fretful Ms Creagh has a brow default-set to frowns. She thinks ill-fate can be neutered by a risk-assessing, intervening political class.Little fun on a skiing trip, I suspect. Before her committee yesterday sat a chap from the Met Office, Peter Stott, and a duo from the state-paid, non-governmental Committee on Climate Change. They were Kathryn Brown and Michael Davies, though he should have been called Michael Mrphhh, he was such a mumbler. Sister Brown began almost every reply with ‘so’. You know the type.The Met Office’s Stott was asked for the official definition of a heatwave. He didn’t really have one. Instead he gave a very British answer: a heatwave was when it was hot for two consecutive nights. South of Suez, they would snort at such wimpishness. Two nights? Two years, surely. But here in Blighty if the mercury rises above 30 degrees celsius (86F) for a couple of nights, a hosepipe ban cannot be long delayed.Ms Creagh: ‘Was it a heatwave last weekend?’ Mr Stott: ‘We’re calling that a hot spell.’ Sometimes science can sound awfully like a hairdresser’s smalltalk. Ms Creagh was in anguish.          Zac Goldsmith, pictured,  asked if hotter weather would bring benefits from tourismShe feared that ‘the lack of a formal definition of a heatwave could be an obstacle to public understanding. There’s no narrative about when to look after your old people.’At the word ‘narrative’, my bluster-antennae always tingle.Ms Creagh said a 2003 heatwave killed 15,000 in France. She pressed her witnesses for ‘gender analysis’ of heatwave deaths. They seemed to know of little, though Prof Mrphhh did utter a few indistinct words still being deciphered by my analysts. Mr Stott, filling the gap with statements of the obvious, disclosed that the South-East of England tended to be hotter than northern parts of Britain.The Good Ship Rudd juddered... but did not sink: QUENTIN LETTS sees the humbling of the Home SecretaryQUENTIN LETTS: Take it from a father of three, William – you’re about to learn the plate-spinning horror of being OUTNUMBERED The star who’s SIMPLY THE BEST as Tina Turner…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina musical Radiating grandeur, Lord Patten of Barnes milked his adoring audience as the unelected House threw what it intends to be a ner in the Brexit works… QUENTIN LETTS on yesterday in ParliamentPowerful tale of Tina that’s simply the best…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina Turner musicalAs Labour MPs round on their leader QUENTIN LETTS watches as Corbyn muttered like a bulldog chomping on nettlesQUENTIN LETTS watches the PM defend sending in the RAF in Parliament as Labour MPs shook their heads in disagreement with Jeremy CorbynLusty revival has two waggy stars: QUENTIN LETTS reviews The Fantastic Follies Of Mrs Rich QUENTIN LETTS: Its timing may bounce around like a pinball over two months, but I pray Easter never becomes a fixed date No! Was human activity to blame for heatwaves? ‘Even without human activity there would still have been heatwaves,’ he said, but ‘the likelihood of heatwaves was at least doubled by humans.’Ms Creagh nodded with glum satisfaction. ‘Have you got any more granular breakdown on that?’ she asked. ‘Granular’ is another word that sets off hooters in my ear.Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) broke through the pessimism to ask if hotter weather might bring benefits (eg, from tourism). Ms Brown cautiously agreed that we could do ‘comparatively favourably’ from ‘thermal comfort’ modelling.Translation: hotter weather would be good. The mumbling professor indicated that 40,000 oldies currently die from cold weather but deaths from heat are only 2,000. Ms Creagh glowered. Good news wasn’t what she was after at all.Caroline Lucas (Brighton Pavilion) sloped off after just 41 minutes. She may be Parliament’s only Green but that was enough environmental auditing for her, thank ye. What an important person she is.Headline-seeker Geraint Davies (Lab, Swansea W) asked if roads would have to be closed in heatwaves and marathon runners told to stop.Should doctors be told to take their holidays in summertime. The witnesses did not supply him with a usable soundbite. Maddening for him.The usual grindings of politics were on display: MPs seeking publicity and craving alarmism, a public-sector bureaucracy roboting management-speak. Endless baloney about ‘sophisticated modelling’, which always makes me think of Brigitte Bardot in her prime.Prof Mumbler said it was ‘very challenging to set thresholds for comfort in the built environment’ – ie you can’t generalise about how warm a building should be. Ms Brown spoke of ‘the mortality burden’ (ie deaths) and ‘complicated decision trees’ (dithering hospital bosses). Amid all this bureaucratic and Parliamentary hand-wringing, no one mentioned inidual gumption. Every problem was approached from the position of ‘how do we set an all-embracing rule to prevent the unforeseen?’It will now rain all summer. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/09/4B883E8C00000578-5654377-image-m-135_1524644056092.jpg","title":"Meghan looks sombre Anzac Day service remembrance fianc Harry","story":"    A smiling Prince Harry seems happy to be joined by his fiancee Meghan Markle, who was attending her first official memorial service this morning          The American passed a cultural milestone when she, and Harry, were welcomed by Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana with a traditional hongi          Prince Harry was also given a hongi to Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana, which involves the soft pressing of noses and the sharing of each other\u0027s breath          Prince Harry and his  fiancee Meghan Markle walk with New Zealand\u0027s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Jerry Mateparae, after commemorations at Hyde Park Corner          Prince Harry lays a wreath at the Australian War Memorial during an Anzac Day dawn service at Hyde Park Corner in London  Kensington Palace said the Duke of Cambridge hoped to join Harry and Meghan at the afternoon Anzac Day service  Meghan impressed delegates with her first official appearance at a memorial service, as she prepares to be formally welcomed into the royal family next month          Meghan Markle took part in her first official service of remembrance as she joined her fiancé, Prince Harry , at an Anzac Day Dawn Service          Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle exchange a glance during the service, which represents the American\u0027s first ever remembrance event  The pair, who are set to marry next month, both wore long coats this morning for the moving dawn service at Wellington ArchA handwritten note from the prince, attached to a wreath of red roses, read: \u0027For all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of our freedom.

Well look at him now. He\u0027s not even on a ventilator and he\u0027s not suffering.\u0027Asked what intervention doctors had made, he replied: \u0027They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen.\u0027I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.\u0027He\u0027s now on oxygen. It\u0027s not changing his breathing but it\u0027s oxygenating his body.\u0027He is still working, he\u0027s doing as good as he can.\u0027But we do need him to be supported ... in the next hour it\u0027s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.\u0027Because he\u0027s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours and I think he ought to be respected and given that.\u0027            Protesters outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Alfie is being treated          A large number of police are outside the hospital to prevent demonstrators trying to get in          Some supporters have held an overnight vigil for Alfie after it was announced his life support had been withdrawn          Alder Hey has urged parents only to bring children to A\u0026ampE if there is an emergency and also asked Alfie\u0027s supporters to stop calling its switchboard    Alfie Evans\u0027 father Tom speaks to media and a large crowd outside Alder Hey hospital on Tuesday morning after announcing his son was breathing unassisted             The removal of life support comes after the family lost a \u0027last-ditch\u0027 appeal last night to delay the withdrawal of treatment and mount a further legal challenge             Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door            The Pope, who previously met Alfie\u0027s father, intervened again in the case to say he hoped the boy\u0027s parents would be able to seek new treatment      His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have battled through the courts to save their sonMay 2016: Alfie Evans is born apparently perfectly healthy, but misses numerous developmental milestones in his first seven monthsDecember 2016: Alfie catches a chest infection causing seizures, and is taken to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool where he is put on life support.

The Italian Foreign Ministry grants Alfie citizenship amid protests outside the Liverpool hospital. April 23: Alder Hey removes life support for Alfie                                                      Mr Evans said withdrawal of life support would be a \u0027straight up execution\u0027. He earlier posted on Facebook to say he was waiting for Italian authorities to call UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Judges have heard that Alfie, born on May 9 2016, is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition doctors had not definitively diagnosed. On Monday night, Paul Diamond, who represents the couple, told the judge that Alfie had been granted Italian citizenship on Monday, saying there was now an \u0027international relations element\u0027 to the case.But Mr Justice Hayden dismissed Mr Diamond\u0027s application, saying it amounted to a \u0027last-ditch appeal\u0027 and said Alfie was a British citizen and \u0027habitually resident in the UK\u0027, meaning the High Court had jurisdiction. Doctors in Liverpool have said the flight to Italy would be too difficult for him and UK courts, including the Supreme Court, have upheld their decision. The European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital on Monday night, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027 Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027 A source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.            Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition            Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the family    Bambino Gesu, a children\u0027s hospital owned by the Vatican and known as the Pope\u0027s Hospital (pictured), has secured a plane ready to jet Alfie Evans to Rome today.The hospital has contacted Aldey Hey Children\u0027s Hospital  about Alfie\u0027s transfer and has also sent doctors to his bedside.Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research centre in Europe.The hospital has a staff of almost 2,600 including physicians, researchers, nurses, clinical technicians and office staff.Its slogan is: \u0027You think about your child, we\u0027ll think about everything else\u0027.It was also heavily involved in the tragic case of Charlie Gard and had also offered to care for him before he died last year. Bambino Gesu was criticised last year after the publication of a damning investigation in the Italian Press, which accused Bambino Gesu of putting profits before the welfare of children.The scandal occurred before boss Mariella Enoc joined the hospital.                                                     Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027 Dozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027          Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance            Some of the group surge towards are door after protesters tried to block a road to the hospital      A large crowd of around 200 demonstrators gathered outside the hospital on Monday It comes after a British judge said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless, in a decision since backed by Britain\u0027s Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.An ECHR spokesman said on Monday: \u0027The European Court of Human Rights has today rejected the application submitted by the family of Alfie Evans as inadmissible.\u0027The couple have argued that Alfie is being wrongly \u0027detained\u0027 at Alder Hey and have made a habeas corpus application.A writ of habeas corpus - Latin for \u0027you may have the body\u0027 - is a legal manoeuvre which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention.It is a piece of common law which probably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.A spokesman for Alder Hey said: \u0027Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital remains open as usual for all visitors and appointments, however visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence in and around the hospital site - this is part of our ongoing security arrangements.\u0027 The case has echoes of that of Charlie Gard, who was born in August 2016 with a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.The British boy died on July 29, one week short of his first birthday, after doctors withdrew life support treatment.Gard\u0027s parents fought a five-month legal battle for him to be taken to the United States for experimental treatment.They lost a series of appeals in British courts and the ECHR.        Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027            The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing            An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.                         Alfie Evans updates: Police hold back angry protesters as they make stand outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital -

The lack of supply is pushing up prices, leaving young families struggling to get on the ladder.The Government believes that building 300,000 homes a year in England by 2025 is the answer and has ordered local authorities to outline suitable locations.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May warned that if councils don\u0027t build enough houses they will lose their right to determine where they are placed. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, told them he\u0027d be \u0027breathing down their neck\u0027.But Britain\u0027s latest housebuilding drive has led to fierce debates within communities about where these properties should go. At one extreme are the Nimbys (Not In My Back Yard) who don\u0027t want any housebuilding in their neighbourhood for fear the construction would ruin their views and be too noisy.At the other you have a new breed of campaigners nicknamed \u0027Yimbys\u0027 (Yes In My Back Yard) who want housing to help their children and grandchildren raise families.The majority sit somewhere between, pushed and pulled by these factions.          Against: Anna Martin, pictured with daughters Iona (centre) and Annabel, walks and jogs in the woods most days of the weekEastleigh, which must build 14,580 new homes by 2036, is a prime example of the new dynamic. It was one of 15 councils shamed last year for being too slow to put a plan in place. Now the council has revealed a proposal to build nearly 2,000 more homes than required.It has sparked uproar among the residents guiding me around the area. They\u0027re concerned that one in three houses is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood, and the idea of a road through the middle appals them.They tell me one Yimby is pushing this development more than anyone else — Keith House. The Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, who has held that role for more than 20 years, claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxes.\u0027It has been known and accepted for years that we need to build more homes in the right places,\u0027 he says. \u0027While this shift from buying to renting is fine in London and other big cities, there isn\u0027t the stock in the suburbs and on the South coast.\u0027There is a change of tone in the housing debate as people realise that it\u0027s their sons and daughters who can\u0027t afford homes.\u0027It\u0027s clear why families would want to live in a location such as this. You\u0027d have rural Hampshire on your doorstep while being a 30-minute drive from Southampton and within commuting distance of London.And Mr House is adamant he can deliver the schools, roads and other facilities that will be needed here.\u0027All too often councils put the houses up first and then fail to deliver on the infrastructure,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027re committed to putting that in — it\u0027s in the plans.\u0027          Lib Dem councillor Keith House claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxesBut resident Bruce Mitchell, 55, a civil servant, accuses Mr House of ignoring overwhelming opposition. More than 30 people, including environmental experts and charities, spoke against the proposals at a meeting in December that ran on until after 1am, he says.The mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors have quit the Lib Dems over the plans, to run as independents. Even Eastleigh\u0027s Tory MP, Mims Davies, says the move was \u0027panicked and rushed\u0027.Helen Kerris Shaw, 39, who runs an animal charity where the development will be, says: \u0027I\u0027ve volunteered at the charity since I was nine and it\u0027s quite shocking to think it might all be bulldozed over.\u0027Anne Martin, 46, who walks and jogs in the woods most days of the week, says Mr House isn\u0027t thinking about the quality of life in the area.\u0027There are very few places you can go and have such quietness,\u0027 she says. \u0027It is just so short-sighted.\u0027Anne\u0027s daughter Iona, 11, who was highly commended in the British Wildlife Photography Awards, says the road will be like a \u0027Berlin Wall\u0027 for animals which live in the woods.According to the Woodland Trust, just 2 per cent of the UK is ancient woodland which has existed since records began in 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland.Jack Taylor, of the Woodland Trust, says light and road pollution are major threats to wildlife that rarely get mentioned. \u0027These woodlands could be saved with thoughtful design, and people in Eastleigh are right to be alarmed,\u0027 he says.Environmentalists are also concerned that the new road will damage the nearby Itchen river, which has European Special Area of Conservation status. TV naturalist Chris Packham, who grew up in nearby Southampton, has described the plan as \u0027eco-vandalism\u0027.Kate Beal-Blyth, 40, is a member of local action group Action Against Destructive Development.She\u0027s lived in Eastleigh most of her life, running a television production company, and says the group recognises the need to build but says that, with a new railway station and motorway junction, these could be nearer the centre of the borough.          Green belt: One in three houses in the Eastleigh development is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood\u0027We desperately need new homes — they are just being built in the wrong place,\u0027 she says. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, there is space on brownfield land — which has previously been developed — to build one million homes around the country. Many sites already have planning permission so homes can go up straight away, the group says.But PricedOut, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder, says that won\u0027t be enough. It claims much of the green belt isn\u0027t as beautiful as people think — and banning new-builds prevents people from living near work.Mr House agrees. \u0027Every time we have had major development there is inevitable local opposition,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in this case, there is no alternative solution closer to the town centre with the right infrastructure.\u0027Mr House insists he wants to protect the woodland and says the council is not building more homes than Eastleigh needs, as the plan takes into account long-term trends. He says 35 per cent will be affordable housing, with a mix of different property types.          Kate Beal-Blyth is a member of Action Against Destructive DevelopmentSome communities may be able to avoid the sort of disputes that are splitting opinion in Eastleigh.One idea gaining popularity is to fill empty homes before building new ones. More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for at least ten years, according to the Liberal Democrats. About 216,000 have been empty for six months. The Government announced last November that it would allow councils to charge double tax on properties that have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.The Intergenerational Foundation think tank says the Government should focus on filling empty rooms in homes. There are 25 million spare bedrooms in England, it says, adding that many houses are owned by empty-nest pensioners in family-sized houses.For many the costs of downsizing — estimated by Money Mail last year at £29,000 on average — are too off-putting. Experts such as John Godfrey, Theresa May\u0027s former head of policy, say a stamp duty tax break for downsizers could free up these properties for growing families.Mrs May has also suggested former shops could be turned into homes as more people buy online. She says Britain should look to build up as well as out — which could mean using spaces above shops, too.The Prime Minister plans to relax planning rules so people can add two more floors to many properties.Some experts have even suggested building above car parks. Property agency JLL says it has identified 868 car parks within a mile of a station in London that could support an average of 90 homes each. Another concept gaining popularity is the prefab home. These houses are fabricated in factories in as little as 20 days.           Picturesque: The River Itchen which borders the proposed development is one of the world\u0027s most exclusive fishing areasThey are then transported to the necessary location where they take just a few hours to erect. The benefit would be building more homes more quickly, limiting the disruption and noise that cause concern to many Nimbys.The Government hopes that garden towns — whole towns and villages built in commuter belt territory — will also provide room for thousands more homes. Some 14 developments were approved last year from Cornwall to Cumbria. Five in the corridor between Oxford and Cambridge are in the pipeline.Mrs May says she\u0027s working to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Plus there will be a crackdown on developers who sit on land and wait for its value to rise to maximise profits.Yet for residents in areas such as Eastleigh, where councils are under pressure to build thousands of homes right now, these alternatives are emerging too late.Unless enough people back an affordable, sustainable alternative — and win over councillors whose reputations are on the line — campaigners may be fighting a losing battle.It could mean some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful rural areas, whether the locals like it or not, change irrevocably. And as Eastleigh\u0027s 11-year-old photography star Iona Martin is at pains to tell me, that\u0027s causing a great deal of heartache.v.bischoff@dailymail.co.ukOne year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/19/4B6F97E400000578-0-image-a-8_1524422178727.jpg","title":"Man Southwest passenger speaks horror flight","story":"Eric Zilbert, 60, was sitting in front of Jennifer Riordan when the upper half of her body was sucked out of the Southwest Airlines plane last Tuesday\u0027Just this sucking sound. Like being inside a balloon when it deflates,\u0027 he told The Sacramento Bee of the moment. Once he realized what had happened, Riordan was dead, he said. He tried to remain calm on the plane and reassured others around him that they would make it down safely. Southwest Airlines reveals flights will be delayed or...Husband of bank executive who was killed on Southwest flight...Share this articleA self-proclaimed aviation buff, Zilbert, like others who survived the ordeal, said pilot Tammie Jo Shults had a good handle on the plane. \u0027The plane is flying.

The session was arranged by the environmental audit select committee. This nannyish group is chaired by Labour’s Mary Creagh, who first made her name at Westminster by worrying about the temperature of bath water.Pleasant but fretful Ms Creagh has a brow default-set to frowns. She thinks ill-fate can be neutered by a risk-assessing, intervening political class.Little fun on a skiing trip, I suspect. Before her committee yesterday sat a chap from the Met Office, Peter Stott, and a duo from the state-paid, non-governmental Committee on Climate Change. They were Kathryn Brown and Michael Davies, though he should have been called Michael Mrphhh, he was such a mumbler. Sister Brown began almost every reply with ‘so’. You know the type.The Met Office’s Stott was asked for the official definition of a heatwave. He didn’t really have one. Instead he gave a very British answer: a heatwave was when it was hot for two consecutive nights. South of Suez, they would snort at such wimpishness. Two nights? Two years, surely. But here in Blighty if the mercury rises above 30 degrees celsius (86F) for a couple of nights, a hosepipe ban cannot be long delayed.Ms Creagh: ‘Was it a heatwave last weekend?’ Mr Stott: ‘We’re calling that a hot spell.’ Sometimes science can sound awfully like a hairdresser’s smalltalk. Ms Creagh was in anguish.          Zac Goldsmith, pictured,  asked if hotter weather would bring benefits from tourismShe feared that ‘the lack of a formal definition of a heatwave could be an obstacle to public understanding. There’s no narrative about when to look after your old people.’At the word ‘narrative’, my bluster-antennae always tingle.Ms Creagh said a 2003 heatwave killed 15,000 in France. She pressed her witnesses for ‘gender analysis’ of heatwave deaths. They seemed to know of little, though Prof Mrphhh did utter a few indistinct words still being deciphered by my analysts. Mr Stott, filling the gap with statements of the obvious, disclosed that the South-East of England tended to be hotter than northern parts of Britain.The Good Ship Rudd juddered... but did not sink: QUENTIN LETTS sees the humbling of the Home SecretaryQUENTIN LETTS: Take it from a father of three, William – you’re about to learn the plate-spinning horror of being OUTNUMBERED The star who’s SIMPLY THE BEST as Tina Turner…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina musical Radiating grandeur, Lord Patten of Barnes milked his adoring audience as the unelected House threw what it intends to be a ner in the Brexit works… QUENTIN LETTS on yesterday in ParliamentPowerful tale of Tina that’s simply the best…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina Turner musicalAs Labour MPs round on their leader QUENTIN LETTS watches as Corbyn muttered like a bulldog chomping on nettlesQUENTIN LETTS watches the PM defend sending in the RAF in Parliament as Labour MPs shook their heads in disagreement with Jeremy CorbynLusty revival has two waggy stars: QUENTIN LETTS reviews The Fantastic Follies Of Mrs Rich QUENTIN LETTS: Its timing may bounce around like a pinball over two months, but I pray Easter never becomes a fixed date No! Was human activity to blame for heatwaves? ‘Even without human activity there would still have been heatwaves,’ he said, but ‘the likelihood of heatwaves was at least doubled by humans.’Ms Creagh nodded with glum satisfaction. ‘Have you got any more granular breakdown on that?’ she asked. ‘Granular’ is another word that sets off hooters in my ear.Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) broke through the pessimism to ask if hotter weather might bring benefits (eg, from tourism). Ms Brown cautiously agreed that we could do ‘comparatively favourably’ from ‘thermal comfort’ modelling.Translation: hotter weather would be good. The mumbling professor indicated that 40,000 oldies currently die from cold weather but deaths from heat are only 2,000. Ms Creagh glowered. Good news wasn’t what she was after at all.Caroline Lucas (Brighton Pavilion) sloped off after just 41 minutes. She may be Parliament’s only Green but that was enough environmental auditing for her, thank ye. What an important person she is.Headline-seeker Geraint Davies (Lab, Swansea W) asked if roads would have to be closed in heatwaves and marathon runners told to stop.Should doctors be told to take their holidays in summertime. The witnesses did not supply him with a usable soundbite. Maddening for him.The usual grindings of politics were on display: MPs seeking publicity and craving alarmism, a public-sector bureaucracy roboting management-speak. Endless baloney about ‘sophisticated modelling’, which always makes me think of Brigitte Bardot in her prime.Prof Mumbler said it was ‘very challenging to set thresholds for comfort in the built environment’ – ie you can’t generalise about how warm a building should be. Ms Brown spoke of ‘the mortality burden’ (ie deaths) and ‘complicated decision trees’ (dithering hospital bosses). Amid all this bureaucratic and Parliamentary hand-wringing, no one mentioned inidual gumption. Every problem was approached from the position of ‘how do we set an all-embracing rule to prevent the unforeseen?’It will now rain all summer. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/09/4B883E8C00000578-5654377-image-m-135_1524644056092.jpg","title":"Meghan looks sombre Anzac Day service remembrance fianc Harry","story":"    A smiling Prince Harry seems happy to be joined by his fiancee Meghan Markle, who was attending her first official memorial service this morning          The American passed a cultural milestone when she, and Harry, were welcomed by Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana with a traditional hongi          Prince Harry was also given a hongi to Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana, which involves the soft pressing of noses and the sharing of each other\u0027s breath          Prince Harry and his  fiancee Meghan Markle walk with New Zealand\u0027s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Jerry Mateparae, after commemorations at Hyde Park Corner          Prince Harry lays a wreath at the Australian War Memorial during an Anzac Day dawn service at Hyde Park Corner in London  Kensington Palace said the Duke of Cambridge hoped to join Harry and Meghan at the afternoon Anzac Day service  Meghan impressed delegates with her first official appearance at a memorial service, as she prepares to be formally welcomed into the royal family next month          Meghan Markle took part in her first official service of remembrance as she joined her fiancé, Prince Harry , at an Anzac Day Dawn Service          Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle exchange a glance during the service, which represents the American\u0027s first ever remembrance event  The pair, who are set to marry next month, both wore long coats this morning for the moving dawn service at Wellington ArchA handwritten note from the prince, attached to a wreath of red roses, read: \u0027For all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of our freedom.

Well look at him now. He\u0027s not even on a ventilator and he\u0027s not suffering.\u0027Asked what intervention doctors had made, he replied: \u0027They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen.\u0027I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.\u0027He\u0027s now on oxygen. It\u0027s not changing his breathing but it\u0027s oxygenating his body.\u0027He is still working, he\u0027s doing as good as he can.\u0027But we do need him to be supported ... in the next hour it\u0027s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.\u0027Because he\u0027s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours and I think he ought to be respected and given that.\u0027            Protesters outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Alfie is being treated          A large number of police are outside the hospital to prevent demonstrators trying to get in          Some supporters have held an overnight vigil for Alfie after it was announced his life support had been withdrawn          Alder Hey has urged parents only to bring children to A\u0026ampE if there is an emergency and also asked Alfie\u0027s supporters to stop calling its switchboard    Alfie Evans\u0027 father Tom speaks to media and a large crowd outside Alder Hey hospital on Tuesday morning after announcing his son was breathing unassisted             The removal of life support comes after the family lost a \u0027last-ditch\u0027 appeal last night to delay the withdrawal of treatment and mount a further legal challenge             Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door            The Pope, who previously met Alfie\u0027s father, intervened again in the case to say he hoped the boy\u0027s parents would be able to seek new treatment      His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have battled through the courts to save their sonMay 2016: Alfie Evans is born apparently perfectly healthy, but misses numerous developmental milestones in his first seven monthsDecember 2016: Alfie catches a chest infection causing seizures, and is taken to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool where he is put on life support.

The Italian Foreign Ministry grants Alfie citizenship amid protests outside the Liverpool hospital. April 23: Alder Hey removes life support for Alfie                                                      Mr Evans said withdrawal of life support would be a \u0027straight up execution\u0027. He earlier posted on Facebook to say he was waiting for Italian authorities to call UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Judges have heard that Alfie, born on May 9 2016, is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition doctors had not definitively diagnosed. On Monday night, Paul Diamond, who represents the couple, told the judge that Alfie had been granted Italian citizenship on Monday, saying there was now an \u0027international relations element\u0027 to the case.But Mr Justice Hayden dismissed Mr Diamond\u0027s application, saying it amounted to a \u0027last-ditch appeal\u0027 and said Alfie was a British citizen and \u0027habitually resident in the UK\u0027, meaning the High Court had jurisdiction. Doctors in Liverpool have said the flight to Italy would be too difficult for him and UK courts, including the Supreme Court, have upheld their decision. The European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital on Monday night, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027 Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027 A source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.            Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition            Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the family    Bambino Gesu, a children\u0027s hospital owned by the Vatican and known as the Pope\u0027s Hospital (pictured), has secured a plane ready to jet Alfie Evans to Rome today.The hospital has contacted Aldey Hey Children\u0027s Hospital  about Alfie\u0027s transfer and has also sent doctors to his bedside.Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research centre in Europe.The hospital has a staff of almost 2,600 including physicians, researchers, nurses, clinical technicians and office staff.Its slogan is: \u0027You think about your child, we\u0027ll think about everything else\u0027.It was also heavily involved in the tragic case of Charlie Gard and had also offered to care for him before he died last year. Bambino Gesu was criticised last year after the publication of a damning investigation in the Italian Press, which accused Bambino Gesu of putting profits before the welfare of children.The scandal occurred before boss Mariella Enoc joined the hospital.                                                     Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027 Dozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027          Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance            Some of the group surge towards are door after protesters tried to block a road to the hospital      A large crowd of around 200 demonstrators gathered outside the hospital on Monday It comes after a British judge said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless, in a decision since backed by Britain\u0027s Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.An ECHR spokesman said on Monday: \u0027The European Court of Human Rights has today rejected the application submitted by the family of Alfie Evans as inadmissible.\u0027The couple have argued that Alfie is being wrongly \u0027detained\u0027 at Alder Hey and have made a habeas corpus application.A writ of habeas corpus - Latin for \u0027you may have the body\u0027 - is a legal manoeuvre which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention.It is a piece of common law which probably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.A spokesman for Alder Hey said: \u0027Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital remains open as usual for all visitors and appointments, however visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence in and around the hospital site - this is part of our ongoing security arrangements.\u0027 The case has echoes of that of Charlie Gard, who was born in August 2016 with a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.The British boy died on July 29, one week short of his first birthday, after doctors withdrew life support treatment.Gard\u0027s parents fought a five-month legal battle for him to be taken to the United States for experimental treatment.They lost a series of appeals in British courts and the ECHR.        Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027            The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing            An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.                         Alfie Evans updates: Police hold back angry protesters as they make stand outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/07/4B7EDC1100000578-0-image-a-3_1524638727041.jpg","title":"Two officers caught camera messing childrens playground duty","story":"    A police officer is seen using what appears to be a mobile phone to record their colleague playing on the children\u0027s slide near the Andover estate in Holloway, north London          The footage of the two officers larking about in the playground - which was filmed at the weekend - was taken in Holloway, north London, which is an area plagued by knife crimeEXCLUSIVE: Fury as police officers pose for \u0027insensitive\u0027...Panicked mother only found out her daughter had flipped her...Share this articleThe mum the officers appeared to briefly look round the play area - and then to her amazement began to take their turns on the play equipment meant for toddlers. She claimed the officers were filming each other larking around. \u0027The police were in the park for 10-15 mins,\u0027 she said. \u0027My daughter called me at first and said, mummy there\u0027s police outside. I noticed a police van and then noticed the police in the park, at first they seemed as if they were looking for something. \u0027After a while I noticed them recording each other playing on the swings and on the slide.

At the weekend a 20 year old man was stabbed to death in Finsbury Park - less than two miles from the playground in Holloway. The stabbing was close to the home of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn It is not the first time police have been filmed messing around while in duty. The Met was severely criticised in March when after posting a ‘selfie’ of beat officers at a murder scene in Stratford, east London, in March - just hours after a young man was killed.Salisbury Police was blasted in the same month when two more officers took a grinning selfie in front an overturned car on a snowy motorway.A mother only found out her daughter had flipped her car on a treacherous road after police tweeted the photo in front of the crash site.Meanwhile police in Humberside came in for criticism after 18 officers were photographed riding the dodgems at a funfair while others looked on last October. One of the riders was Chief Superintendent Darren Downs, who posted a picture on Twitter and described having a \u0027fantastic afternoon at the fair\u0027.   A witness who recorded the footage told MailOnline that she witnessed the officers playing on the slide, using the swings and climbing the monkey bars that are meant for toddlersAnother senior officer, Inspector Scott Snowden, also posted a series of pictures on social media and wrote: \u0027Cops having a bit of well earned fun with people at the fair!\u0027. Angry local residents said the police should have been out on patrol and not enjoying the rides at Hull Fair last October. A Met Police spokesman said: \u0027We know that Londoners want to see police officers patrolling their neighbourhoods, and the Met is committed to doing just that. \u0027Police officers need to be approachable and visible in all areas of London.

It will include paintings and installation pieces, and classically inspired sculptures such as a version of the Venus de Milo, challenging the antique marbles filling many of the state rooms.“His attitude to life was that everything was possible as long as you set your mind to it – a very positive outlook on the world which is perhaps something we need more than ever now,” said the curator Michael Frahm. “He died too young, but he was hugely hard working, and his work remains highly influential, one of the most original and influential artists of the 20th century.”Frahm is the director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, founded in 2014 by Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill to bring annual exhibitions of contemporary art into the bewilderingly grand formal rooms of his family home. The series has formerly featured living artists and launched with a major exhibition from Ai Weiwei. The Chinese artist was then under house arrest in Beijing but toured the the space to plan the installation through a specially created 3D computer model. The exhibition proved so popular its run had to be extended twice.The 18th-century Oxfordshire palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and set in a landscape designed by the famed gardener Capability Brown, has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 1987. Blenheim was conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough for his victories in war, but as the costs escalated dizzyingly funds stopped with £220,000 spent and the 28,330-sq-metre (seven-acre) house only half completed.

Are they fun and environmentally friendly – or a dangerous nuisance?Electric share scooters have taken over Santa Monica, an affluent beachside city on the edge of Los Angeles, but as they swiftly spread across other cities in California and the US a backlash is already gathering force.Download an app, scan a scooter’s barcode and away you go, zipping at up to 15mph to your destination. You leave the scooter on the pavement for the next rider.Bird, a startup run by former Uber executives, launched the scooters in Santa Monica last September. Hundreds were deposited around the city overnight, the devices so ubiquitous people literally tripped over them.They have thrilled, bemused and aggravated – feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year.A full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices. With a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing backBird comes armed with $115m (£80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine.“The demand is huge. We’re looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world,” says Stephen Schnell, the company’s vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the company’s radar. “We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.”Schnell, like Bird’s CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber.Ride sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the “last mile” problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. “This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.”Marlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space.“Traditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable ‘short trip’ vehicle is.”Boarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution.The boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets – exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China – act as a cautionary tale.  scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the city’s downtown to Bird’s headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55 – a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute. The experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the app’s map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways.Once you’ve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone there’s a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebar’s throttle button and gliding down the street.Not encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings – both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone.Tootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasn’t one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now they’re part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon – except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures.Bird reports quick adoption there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. “It’s kind of amazing,” says Schnell. What’s amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders. Few wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media.Riders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a driver’s licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops.Irked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines.“Even though they got off to a rocky start we didn’t move to kick them out because based on our values we’re really committed to this new model of mobility,” says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monica’s deputy city manager. There has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. “We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.”But there’s another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block won’t people have even less incentive to walk and exercise? “You mean WALL-E world,” says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs. “Let’s hope not. With the scooters at least you have to stand.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff056944b3ca2e4c133ad297fbbe191b0f65da5/0_412_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401b68feb97750902f20700d8c19e639","title":"school good food not just posh kids poorest town oldham","story":"Should you ever need cheering up, I can recommend 11am at Stanley Road primary in Oldham. That’s when lunch starts for the youngest children and it is pure excitement the kind you used to have when horizons were short, days were long and nothing else needed bothering about. First comes the babble of voices, far bigger than the little bodies that follow, swaddled in plump anoraks despite the sun outside. They take crockery, these four- and five-year-olds who, back in September, didn’t know how to hold a knife and fork – and get down to the serious business of\u0026nbspchoosing.Behind the counter stands Sheena Fineran: black hat, big specs, magenta polo and, after 30 years as a dinner lady, in complete mastery of her domain. “When I started, it was lumpy mash. It was liver. It was cheap, fried, nasty food.“Today we’re the best.” Oldham’s school meals are high quality, wholesome and prize-winning. “What I see now – that’s what I’d give my family.”Almost everything in these serving trays has been cooked from scratch this morning in the school’s own kitchen. That roast chicken comes from one of 14 birds that Fineran came in at 6am to roast and strip, singeing her own fingers as she did so. The fish cake is baked with catch certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. More options are laid out here than in most office canteens I’ve visited and, from the carrots up, as much of the food as possible is organic and locally sourced. Then a boy far\u0026nbspshorter and shyer than the rest reaches the front of the queue.A whisper comes back: “Pineapple.” “I bet there’s some hiding,” laughs a colleague, and Fineran bustles off to root it out.Any council would be proud of serving meals that prompt children to present teachers their cleaned-out plates as if they were sports day trophies – but to see what makes this daily ballet such a vast achievement you need to contrast it with those carrying lunchboxes.From one, a boy of seven pulls out some kebab and processed cheese. A few tables down sits a girl chewing stiff chicken nuggets. Others turn up with cold toast or last night’s chips.Some children come to school on an empty stomach and go home to no supper. Headteacher Rebecca Howarth runs a breakfast club and makes sure they get double lunches, even though it comes out of her shrinking budget. “We’ll find some way to do it. You can’t have children going hungry. I can’t.”In 2016 the Office for National Statistics found Oldham to be the poorest town in England . In some of its neighbourhoods, a boy born today can expect to die soon after he hits 70. His counterpart raised just off London’s swanky Brompton Road would be forecast to live until he is 96. In one of the richest societies in human history, something as simple as being born into the wrong class in the wrong town can knock more than 25 years off your life.As mementoes of its industrial, radical past, Oldham has some beautiful redbrick buildings. What it lacks is cash. While Fineran and I are chatting, one of her colleagues comes over to ask whether it’s true that Theresa May is going to scrap free school meals for the under-sevens. When she hears not, her relief is like the sun breaking through clouds: her own boy starts reception this September.What are poor children worth? What do they deserve? The official answer is everything, just like every other child. The reality is that hundreds of thousands of children across Britain go hungry now. Headteachers report grey-skinned pupils “filling their pockets” at the school canteen, while London GPs treat youngsters with that Victorian disease caused by poor diet, rickets.Yet in Oldham the school dinner service runs on the principle that those who have the least also deserve the best possible. It delivers that within very tight budgets, spending a rock-bottom 65p on food for every meal and charging a mere £2.10.Even Jamie Oliver, who almost single-handedly killed the Turkey Twizzler, has sighed: “Feeding your kid right is all considered very posh and middle class.” Yet here it is, happening in the poorest nook of England – and not in some bijou cafe serving 20 foodies and their Instagram accounts, but a municipal office with 86 school kitchens dishing out 17,000 meals a day. Without a council subsidy, the service has to pay its way and it competes with the likes of Compass, also tendering for local school\u0026nbspcontracts.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently?

We’ll include some of your stories in our reporting.So what’s the magic formula? Whoever you ask, it comes down to two words: Anne Burns. Head of Oldham’s school dinner department, she’s also “a force of nature”, says public food academic Kevin Morgan. Visitors from Manchester mayor Andy Burnham’s office, who want the rest of the area to learn from Oldham’s example on school meals, tell her: “If only we could cut you up into pieces and spread you around.”Anyone slicing into Burns would immediately find two things: an expertise on food and a love of animals. Having done school dinners for 40 years, since training as a cook aged 16, she abhors “ping meals” and “plastic food”. When “Jamie started shaking the tree” and campaigning for better school meals in the middle of the last decade, he found a ready audience in the recently-promoted Burns.On the office noticeboard is a page from Chat magazine headlined “Saved by my dog!” It tells the story of how, early one morning three years ago, Burns began spewing blood and mucus before passing out. Only her sleek brown weimaraner, Alice (one of her six dogs and seven cats at the time) brought her round by licking her face and smacking her with her paws. Rushing her into hospital theatre, the surgeon declared: “I should be signing your death certificate.”She needs that toughness, arguing for better food in a council that can always find uses for spare money and is staffed largely by men in suits. As if to exemplify their outsider status, she and her team of women, with 125 years’ catering experience between them, work out of a bungalow plonked next to the town hall. It’s a Cinderella\u0026nbspservice, as school catering is across the country, but as she tells her team: “Tonight, girls, Cinderella’s off to the ball!”More profoundly, Burns is a public servant who looks, sounds and understands the public she serves. Born just down the road in Rochdale, she still lives there – and in over four decades she’s only ever worked for two local authorities. Mum a housewife, dad a painter-decorator who, at 80, still does the odd job. The family home had no phone, but when she remembers her “normal working-class” childhood, it’s of camping all summer long and cricket matches that lasted weeks. She wasn’t raised to be second best, nor does she expect it of the children she feeds.“Those kiddies are our future,” she says. “They’re the most important people. Without them, where do we go?” Contrast that plaintiveness with the high-flier who hops from council to consultancy and whose main job is to tell the residents who pay his salary how terrible their lifestyles are and how their homes need to be replaced with luxury flats.When Burns began altering her menu, by far and away her department’s main supplier was Brakes. Yet the giant multinational was far too big to accommodate the diet fads of some new manager at a town council. Organic wholemeal flour? Brakes was never going to keep a pallet exclusively for Oldham’s use.Which left a gap in the market for small independents, such as TC Meats. Walk into its offices and you’re in no doubt about the chief topic of conversation. Above the factory is a shrine to Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney that presumably doubles as a workplace: a giant poster hails ‘The Maradona of Manchester’, a signed shirt is on the wall, and his neon-yellow boots sit in a glass box on the boss’s coffee table. Some faceless conglomerate this is not.TC Meats sorted out Burns with organic beef and milk and, after a bit of phoning around, it also found a farm selling organic eggs. And why wouldn’t they make the effort? Unlike at Brakes, TC Meats needs Oldham for a big chunk of business. Together with a fruit and veg distributor in Preston, these two relatively local firms have taken a far bigger share of Burns’ budget – while she knows exactly where her produce is coming from. The depth of those partnerships means that Burns can sometimes lean on her suppliers to keep her costs within budget.This is localism with a small “l”. It keeps public money close to home and uses it to grow the local economy and it’s why Morgan describes Burns as “a heroine of public-sector innovation”.For Burns, it’s a choice made not out of ideology but pragmatism. “When the horsemeat scandal came, I slept soundly in my bed,” she says. “We don’t serve stuff from the other side of the world. We know exactly where it comes from.”At Stanley Road primary, Fineran and her team are dishing out for the 10-year-olds. Do the students really care whether their potatoes are organic or their fish is sustainably sourced? “For me, it’s an expense for them it’s an education. We’re giving these kids a good start here,” says Fineran.“I see them come in aged four and go at 11, and it’s an absolute joy to see them doing brilliantly in maths and\u0026nbspEnglish and socialising. It’s like watching my children. It’s an achievement to which I’ve contributed a small part.“We’re deprived – but we’re not.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the Join Aditya below the line at noon (BST) today (Wednesday 25 April) for a special discussion of this piece and the Alternatives series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30a371ba98ea2fb942417b110dac1d6c06ba944/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1acdf5f3bfcb97f2766ccfde501b06e8 700w","title":"football alex oxlade chamberlain injury world cup russia liverpool roma champions league","story":"Jürgen Klopp fears Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s fine debut season for Liverpool is over after the midfielder suffered a knee injury against Roma that threatens his involvement at the World Cup.Oxlade-Chamberlain was taken off on a stretcher in distress during the Champions League semi-final first leg victory following a 15th-minute challenge on Aleksandar Kolarov, his right knee appearing to give way as he tackled the former Manchester City defender.The extent of the England international’s injury will not be known until later in the week but the Liverpool manager said the club’s medical team did not expect him to play again this season. With only two months to go before the World Cup, Oxlade-Chamberlain’s loss is also likely to impact on Gareth Southgate’s plans for Russia.Klopp said: “The biggest blow for the mood in the dressing room is the injury of Oxlade-Chamberlain, so conceding two goals is not what we want 100 per cent but we can deal with that.”Lucky to get away with pushing first-half Kolarov effort on to his bar otherwise relatively quiet\u0026nbsp6Another nerveless performance from the teenager, given space to push on\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspStrong defensively, struck Roma’s bar just before half-time.

We don’t know yet but when all the medical department are concerned without a scan then you know it doesn’t look good. The season is not that long any more.“I am a very positive person and hope it only feels bad but the reason I am not flying mood-wise tonight is because we lost a fantastic player. I am not in the mood to talk about fantastic things. Since I have been here Liverpool has always had to take the more difficult way but in the end Liverpool have always succeeded.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8437dea61cdb7498c64281fb5ca7034241135580/0_136_4511_2707/master/4511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e3dcede59dbae8d8d12dd588edf6cc","title":"jupp heynckes bayern munich confident zidane real madrid","story":"Heynckes came out of retirement six months ago and has steered Bayern to the semi-final as he looks for a record-equalling third Champions League“Nobody had any intention of me being here,” Jupp Heynckes said, sitting at a desk at the Allianz Arena, a microphone tilted towards him, the board behind splattered with sponsors, a card in front saying: “Uefa Champions League”.It turned out he was not finished after all but at 72 this really will be the last time, one more European night in Munich. Six months after being pulled from retirement, called by his old friend Uli Hoeness and asked to coach Bayern for a fourth time, he leads his club into another semi-final. In front of him stands another club with which he has won this competition, Real Madrid.Returning was, Heynckes said then, “a question of the heart”. But if he was coming back, it was to compete. Bayern recovered: the league title is won, the cup awaits and another treble is possible,  as in 2013. “I adore football and, if I do a job, I do it 100 per cent,” he said here. “These are the games you work for and lots of coaches never get the chance to play one of these in their lives. I came back at a very old age and now I have the privilege of being successful again, reaching a semi-final and possibly going through to the final. I am confident.“Football has changed but my style of leadership, my approach, hasn’t. The game has progressed but in the end they are still people out on the pitch, people with different personalities and feelings.”The best example has been James Rodríguez, on loan from Madrid. Bayern will make the deal permanent at the end of the season. “He was a bit down, not in good physical shape either, but I have talked to him a lot and bit by bit his confidence came back. He is more free now and our fans love seeing him play: he has fantastic vision, he’s integrated into the team, happy in Munich. The team that wins the Champions League is the one that is most united.”Toni Kroos, who was part of Bayern’s 2013 Champions League winning team and plays for Madrid, said: “I have the feeling they are much better off with Heynckes. Physically they look to be in good shape, you can see there is a good atmosphere in the team and the whole club.“Heynckes is able to make the collective function the atmosphere within a team is very important. It’s not just about tactical issues it’s also good to keep everyone happy. We’re here to change that a bit.”And that is the thing. For all Heynckes’s confidence, for all that he responded to questions about how he could stop Cristiano Ronaldo by replying, “I might ask you how they can stop Robert Lewandowski,” he was quick to note Madrid are formidable.The chance to win this trophy a third time awaits, something achieved only by Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti. But the team standing before him are Real Madrid and, as Kroos put it, “the Champions League releases special powers” in them. The man occupying the other bench also has a special relationship with this competition and in which he has admitted to feeling he has some kind of guiding “star”.Zinedine Zidane, like Heynckes, is seeking his third European Cup as a manager. It took him 18 months to win two, the first manager in the Champions League era to win consecutive titles it is 20 years since Heynckes first won it, five since his last. In 1998 he won it with Madrid, ending the club’s 32-year wait to be European champions again – “a liberation,” Heynckes called it, although he insisted he had never watched the video. On the other side, playing for Juventus, was Zidane, 27 years his junior.“He is a coach I have maximum respect for, for what he had done at Bayern and at Madrid too,” Zidane said. “He has done great things, he’s admirable. I only have good words for this man. And Bayern is not just a good team, it’s a great club.”The feeling is mutual there was warmth in Heynckes’s words. “I have played against great players and coaches: Sacchi, Cruyff, Lippi, Happel and I have always been a great admirer of Zinedine Zidane as a player and a coach,” he said. “I love how Real Madrid play and his calmness on the touchline, not making a big fuss, not playing to the gallery or the TV cameras. For 90 minutes he follows what is happening on the pitch.”There is something more than finance, Heynckes noted, something deeper that has revived. And while he was clearly enjoying this, there was also a sense of vindication and his line sounded perhaps more pointed when it is considered these teams, though no paupers, faced Paris Saint-Germain this season and, unlike the French champions, are still there. “A team has to respect itself, have human qualities. You can’t buy the Champions League,” he said. You cannot buy moments like this either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d67d6ad2842e0f8095cb7370ce77978e9054a62/289_53_3026_1816/master/3026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92ad1af432d2485d791f2d946e10bc1e","title":"liverpool roma champions league semi final first leg match report 5 2","story":"Of all the mesmerising nights Liverpool have experienced under Anfield’s floodlights in the European competitions, where does this one stand? Up there, surely, with Saint-Étienne in 1977, Olympiakos in 2005, the fightback against Borussia Dortmund in 2016 and all the other famous occasions. Liverpool have added another exhilarating one to an already extensive list and, barring an almost implausible feat of escapology from Roma, can start looking forward to the final in Ukraine on 26 May.The only possible note of caution is that Roma have already overcome a 4-1 first-leg deficit in the Stadio Olimpico against Barcelona in the quarter-finals. On that basis Jürgen Klopp was entitled to be dismayed by his team’s carelessness when they had a 5-0 lead. Yet perhaps the manager miscalculated by withdrawing Mohamed Salah, who had scored twice and set up two of the others. Roma promptly scored two of their own and, somehow, a hitherto rampant Liverpool side had to endure a nervous climax against reinvigorated opponents.Ultimately, though, it was another triumphant night for Liverpool – a scintillating performance, for the most part – and Klopp’s team will head to Italy for the return in a position of strength. True, it might not have been the position they anticipated when they led by five goals and were threatening to add even more. Yet it was a smile on Klopp’s face at the final whistle. Liverpool might have been disappointed not to inflict a quick kill but they have inflicted grievous damage and, on this evidence, they should be confident about adding more goals when the sides meet again on Wednesday week.Roma played well for the opening 20 minutes and found some new momentum in the final quarter of an hour. In between, however, Serie A’s third-placed side looked in need of smelling salts. Liverpool attacked from every angle. The din was extraordinary and Salah had such a hold on the match that it felt almost like a trick of the mind to realise that the fifth goal, when Roberto Firmino headed in James Milner’s corner, did not have the Egyptian’s fingerprints all over it.Lucky to get away with pushing first-half Kolarov effort on to his bar otherwise relatively quiet\u0026nbsp6Another nerveless performance from the teenager, given space to push on\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspStrong defensively, struck Roma’s bar just before half-time.

Later provided good support to score the third goal\u0026nbsp7Ratings by Paul WilsonAt that stage, with 69 minutes gone, it would not have been a surprise if Liverpool had emulated, or even bettered, the seven goals that Manchester United scored past Roma in the 2007 quarter-finals. Instead there was a strange and unexpected end to a wild and eccentric evening. There has never been a semi-final in the Champions League with more goals and, if nothing else, at least Roma kept the tie alive with their late show of resistance. Yet the point remains that Liverpool ought to be enthralled with their night’s work.In the process Salah scored his 42nd and 43rd goals of the season. Sadio Mané added another to his personal collection and Roberto Firmino scored two of his own. Together, those three have accumulated 87 goals this season. Mané’s finishing might have been erratic sometimes but he quickly realised he had the beating of Federico Fazio, the former Tottenham Hotspur reserve. Firmino rarely disappoints on the big occasions and for long spells it was difficult not to pity Eusebio Di Francesco’s team. Roma were taking an almighty chasing.Encouraged by early save from Salah, but given little chance by the same player twice before half-time 6Former Tottenham player was solid in the air, adventurous on the ground when going forward\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspGreece international was caught out of position when Firmino slipped Salah through for second goal\u0026nbsp6Booked when surprised by Mané’s pace, not a success at stopping Salah, a night to forget\u0026nbsp5Not given time to\u0026nbspplay his usual game, the midfielder struggled to handle Liverpool’s pace\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspEarly shot saved but the Netherlands international possibly at fault for second Liverpool goal\u0026nbsp6Could have opened the scoring but rarely made it as far forward again\u0026nbsp6The 20-year-old\u0026nbspTurk was anonymous until being takenoff at half-time\u0026nbspfor Schick\u0026nbsp5Always willing to receive the ball, even under pressure. Some good touches and close control\u0026nbsp7Not his most impressive game, often stationed too wide to cause trouble, but took goal well\u0026nbsp7Ratings by Paul Wilson\u0026nbspMore than anyone, it was another night to savour the little guy with the magic in his feet and enough manners to hold up his palms in front of the away end to apologise for his first-half goals. Salah scored 34 times in 83 appearances for Roma but this performance was another reminder that he operates now at a different level.His first goal was a peach – a curling, diagonal shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar – but the second was not too shabby either. Firmino slipped the pass through the middle and once Salah reached the ball first there was a sense of inevitability about what would happen next – a touch to steady himself, a quick look up and then an impudent chip over Alisson, the Roma goalkeeper, almost in slow motion.When Manchester City came here in the quarter-finals Liverpool inflicted the damage with a blitz of three goals before half-time. This time they restricted themselves to Salah’s double but one of the more attractive traits of this side is that, when they are in a winning position, they always go looking for more goals. Another team might have prioritised a clean sheet in the second half. Liverpool, on the other hand, sensed a rout, attacking from every angle, with Salah at the hub of everything.Perhaps, in the end, that sense of adventure cost them but it was difficult to be too critical when they had scored five and could also reflect on the chances that Mané missed, the header that Dejan Lovren thudded against the crossbar and the times when Salah slalomed round his former team-mates. Salah left Juan Jesus for dead to set up Firmino’s first goal. Jesus, Roma’s left-sided centre-half, had to be substituted midway through the second half and Aleksandar Kolarov, the former Manchester City defender, did not have the speed or agility to keep up with the newly crowned Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year. Even by Salah’s standards, this was an exceptional performance of skill, sophistication and big-game expertise.All of which made it perplexing that Klopp removed his chief tormentor in the 75th minute. Liverpool lost their momentum and Lovren’s mistake let Edin Dzeko pull one back before the substitute Diego Perotti added another from the penalty spot, capitalising on Milner’s handball.The only other downside for Liverpool was the knee injury suffered by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in a challenge with Kolarov in the first half. The midfielder was taken off on a stretcher with his season hanging in the balance. Indeed, Oxlade-Chamberlain seemed so badly hurt there have to be serious concerns he would miss the Champions League final if his team-mates finish the job. Klopp, of course, did not want to be so presumptuous but surely Liverpool will not blow it from this position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0946b6fa6ffdc7a14dd8e6152e5ca6d2ded288/194_412_5086_3051/master/5086.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=830495273cb7ecb318e9dd4672a34bdf","title":"majestic mohamed salah liverpool roma champions league semi final","story":"Reds’ talisman broke the back of his former club before Roma hit back with two goals as he caught his breath on the benchTen minutes before half-time on a wild night of Champions League football Mohamed Salah did perhaps the best thing so far of the many wonderful things contained in his dreamy first Liverpool season.By that stage Anfield was in one of those periods of constant uproar, jiggled and tickled and dragged into a state of intoxication as Liverpool battered away at Roma without drawing breath. It is no secret this Liverpool team play in surges, moments when the day seems to turn a shade of deep red and when the front three become a whirl of malevolent action.But this was something new. Liverpool and Salah did not just accelerate away from Roma, they eviscerated them, almost but not quite killing a semi-final that remains, somehow, in the balance.Liverpool were relentless in those periods, shaking and ragging Roma in their jaws like a terrier with an old leather slipper. Of five Liverpool goals in the space of 35 minutes Salah scored two and provided assists for Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané.Roma pulled back two late goals with Salah off the pitch to make it 5-2 and raise memories of the way they came back at home to knock out Barcelona. Another 3-0 win would do the job this time too. But then, Roma will also have to face Salah again, with bruises still fresh from a beating that came in high-speed waves.Salah was that rare thing, an athlete at the top of his profession finding new heights, new levels. There may be a more breathtakingly brilliant attacking performance in Europe this season but, given the game and the stage, there has not been one yet.For the PFA Premier League’s player of the year this is elite territory, the kind of performance that ends up on stage in Zurich draped in a terrible tuxedo holding a golden bauble and beaming with that rare glaze of sporting ultimacy.It began with the most vital of all his many beautiful goals this season, one of those moments when the game seems to stop. Salah took the ball inside the penalty area found himself with a tiny pocket of space. With a shift of feet he looked up and produced with no real backlift a shot that did something extraordinary, the ball seeming to hang under the lights, generating a strange moment of hush as it arced under the bar before crashing down over the line.It was the first cut in a sublime 15-minute spell for Salah. Best of all it came after a bitty, angsty start. For the opening quarter this had been a different kind of match as Roma’s calmness on the ball, their physical power and the loss of momentum caused by a serious injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took the crackle out of the air.Liverpool found their ignition in the 26th minute, sparked by a hacking foul on Mané. At which point: welcome to the Red Zone. It was Salah who provided the assassin’s eye but this was a team surge, a spell of pure, fast murder ball. First Mané missed a glorious chance after some lovely deft work by Firmino. And steadily Salah began to skate in from the left-hand side, playing now in his own clear pool of light, isolating Juan Jesus as Roma left their centre-half to face an unwinnable one on one.The goals were coming, hammering at the walls, moaning through the keyhole. If that thumping shot to make it 1-0 brought Anfield to its feet, the finish for Salah’s second before half-time was something different. Again it was Firmino with the sweet approach play, on a night that left Salah up there with Cristiano Ronaldo as the top scorer in the Champions League this season. But this time Salah’s finish was a caress, a dink over Alisson that drew coos and gurgles in among the roars.What to say about him now, in a season that just keeps on soaring up through the clouds? It is easy to forget this was a pointed occasion for Salah personally, newly crowned as the player of the year and now facing the biggest club game of his career against his former employers: unarguably the star, against an opponent forewarned and prepared.In the event the Salah Spring just keeps rolling, with 22 goals and nine assists in his past 19 starts since Boxing Day. More significant than the numbers is the spectacle, the basic joy in Salah’s free-running interpretation of the inside-forward role, a combination of preternatural quick feet, a computer of a creative brain and the rare ability in modern football simply to make the game up in front of him.Salah was too much for Roma as he has been for so many others this season. Defensive jitters may have let Roma back in towards the end but Liverpool will travel to Rome with confidence. Jürgen Klopp has spoken about the need for everyone to join “the train”, for the whole team to push it along together. The Olympic Stadium will be a moment to yank the throttle hard once again, to keep that machine driving on right to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2690fddec0a3929c31f24d2cab62a2be9bdbeca2/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c3bf4811da74e1d62f40d206d8d446","title":"un united nations staff pension fund firms rights abuses","story":" investigation reveals $64bn fund includes investments in companies involved in bribery and major environmental damageThe United Nations is facing calls for a full review of its staff pension fund after the  uncovered that it has around a billion dollars invested in companies whose activities are or have been incompatible with core UN principles and programmes.Established in 1948 by the UN general assembly, the fund provides retirement, death and disability benefits to employees. At present it has 203,050 beneficiaries and a market value of $64bn (£45bn), of which nearly $1.5bn is invested in 24 publicly traded companies. Many of those companies have been or are being prosecuted for corrupt practices, implicated in human rights abuses or in environmental catastrophes.“These investments clearly undermine the credibility of a well-respected organisation,” said Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance. “How can I promote sustainable development and the protection of human rights and simultaneously benefit from violations of these?”Three years on from the study, Amnesty and other groups said little had been done to clean up the pollution, while further claims are ongoing over the continuing contamination caused by the spills. Shell insists it is following international best practice in its operations in Nigeria.Barnaby Pace, from Global Witness’s oil, gas and mining team, told the  that “as a global leader”, the UN must invest responsibly and “leverage its investment positions to demand that all companies it invests in … embed robust anti-corruption measures in practice”.“This will help ensure UN investments are not wasted in companies that compete on bribery instead of quality and allow public money to line the pockets of kleptocratic elites,” said Pace.HSBC was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for what US prosecutors described as wilfully flouting sanctions, allowing at least $881m in drug money to pass through its Mexican branches. Also in 2012, the US Justice Department extracted $3bn from GlaxoSmithKline, in which the fund holds $78m of shares, after the pharmaceutical giant pleaded guilty to failing to report drug safety data, misbranding drugs, and marketing anti-depressants not approved for use by minors to children. The firm was fined $490m in China, where it was found guilty of bribing doctors and hospitals to push products.Küchenmeister said there was some irony as the UN was a driving force behind the authoring of the “six principles for responsible investment” (PRI). The PRI have at their heart environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). Last year the UN staff pension fund was awarded an A+ PRI rating. However, an analysis of the fund’s top 10 biggest shareholdings by leading ESG ratings agency Sustainalytics categorised them as either of “significant controversy”, or “high controversy”. The ratings reflect “impact on the environment and society”, as well as the degree to which they suffer from ESG issues.Ian Richards is one of 11 staff representatives on the UN pension fund’s board. He told the  that when the board met with the secretary general’s representative in charge of the fund’s investments in March, it voiced concerns about lack of oversight. “Everything with the UN is quite complicated but that doesn’t prevent us having a closer look at this,” he said. “We don’t want to find that our pensions are being paid from companies that go against the values that we’ve been working for all our careers.”A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said that while the fund does not comment on specific investments, it “does not believe there is a conflict between its fiduciary obligation to its beneficiaries and core UN objectives”.They added that the fund “addresses ESG concerns by explicitly prohibiting investments in the tobacco and armaments sectors”, and its policy is built around the belief that: “By deploying an active voting and engagement policy which supports NGO initiatives and communities, the fund can more effectively impact positive and sustainable change consistent with our mission.”But Peter Frankental, director of Amnesty’s UK’s business and human rights programme, said there should be a full review.“These revelations are troubling, because the UN cannot distance itself morally from the activities of its staff pension scheme to which it contributes financially, even if this is an independent body run at arm’s length,” he said, “The secretary general should install a council on ethics that decides on the exclusion of companies from investment which violate human rights and environmental norms and standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647e1e7559d79e273fed06bced139e545cc58039/0_3011_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9ab5c84e5af8ad8c9d7553cb78bd1a5","title":"renters hold private landlords account","story":"Turfing people out of their homes is cruel and often criminal, but most renters have no chance of legal support or protection How would you feel if you went to work, or to the shops, and when you came back the locks had been changed and you found yourself homeless?Sadly, more than three quarters of our work, as a social enterprise helping private sector tenants, is with people who are imminently threatened with or who have actually been put on the street by landlords. In particularly unpleasant cases, landlords have changed the locks while their tenants are out shopping, on the school run or at work in some cases, they even throw tenants’ possessions away. This is both cruel and criminal. We provide specialist advice, advocacy and support for vulnerable private tenants and victims of criminal landlords in four London boroughs – Croydon, Enfield, Hounslow and Waltham Forest. We work to prevent unlawful evictions by providing specialist advice, advocacy and support to vulnerable private rented sector tenants and victims of criminal landlords.The long awaited Homelessness Reduction Act has come into force, but already stretched local authorities are understandably concerned about the implications of this new duty, which places new legal duties on councils to ensure that anyone who is homeless or at risk of homelessness has access to meaningful help, irrespective of their priority need status. London councils have stated that even with the £61m additional funding provided nationally over the next three years to help them fulfil this duty, they will be left with a gaping financial black hole to fulfil this obligation. I am all for obliging councils to invest money in preventing homelessness – but we need to address some of the key reasons increasing numbers of people are becoming homeless in the first place. Given the cuts to legal aid in recent years and the lack of housing solicitors, most renters have no chance of using the courts for protection, which is where services like ours step in. Many private landlords don’t understand their obligations worse still, too many use shady agents who are adept at exploiting both landlord and tenant to line their own pockets. We find a phone call or a letter to an offending landlord can sometimes stop them in their tracks.Unfortunately, too many of our clients come to our attention only after one of these landlords has taken the law into their own hands. These situations are desperate but we work with tenants to assess whether there is any way to counter these infringements. For example, Section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 allows a “displaced residential occupier” to break back into their home. But being able to prove the grounds for taking this action depends on a number of factors, including having proof of tenancy and proving there is a risk of violence. And renters have to be robust enough to deal with a hostile landlord. We can’t always get renters back into their homes, but we are getting results. About a third of our clients only need advice, on ensuring landlords have followed the correct legal procedures, for instance.  The housing system is failing. It’s a national crisis that requires local approaches, which is why our Safer Renting initiative is part of the Young Foundation’s Reimagining Rent programme, alongside a number of other innovators across the country striving to make the private rented sector work better for all.

However, the initial claims soon proved to be a one-sided account, as further details emerged, including that the girl’s grandmother – with whom she was ultimately to be placed – was a Muslim and did not speak English.Tower Hamlets council complained about an article on the front page of the newspaper’s 30 August edition – the third front page dedicated to the story that week – in which the newspaper implied that a judge had ruled against the council by ordering that the then five-year-old girl be removed from the Muslim household and placed with her grandmother. In fact, the council had requested that the girl be placed with her grandmother.Under the headline “Ipso upholds complaint against Times”, the paper said the press regulator had ruled that the article breached rule one of the editors’ code of practice, which concerns accuracy.The Muslim Council for Britain (MCB) said the Times should be forced to apologise for its coverage, which it said had pushed an “inaccurate, misleading and bigoted narrative about Muslims”. It said the ruling was “too little, too late”.The Ipso ruling, which was published in full on page two of the newspaper, called the article a “distortion” of the issue. “Ipso’s complaints committee found that the article gave the impression that the judge had found that the placement was a ‘failure’ by the council and that this was why she was ‘removing’ the child from her current foster carers, and placing the child with the grandmother. The committee ruled that this was a distortion,” the ruling said.“The impression given by the article was that the judge’s decision represented a finding against the complainant’s assessment of the child’s needs in organising the foster placements. This was not what the court had decided, or an implication of what the court had decided.”However, the press watchdog did not find that the Times’s omission in the article that the child’s grandmother also had a Muslim background amounted to a failure to take care over accuracy.The furore surrounding child AB, as she was known in court documents, was prompted by a front-page article in the Times headlined “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care” on 28 August. According to confidential local authority reports, a social services supervisor had described the child crying, asking not to be returned to one foster carer because “they don’t speak English”.The report included a pixellated photograph of the girl in the company of a woman, said to be her foster carer, wearing Islamic dress.The Daily Mail picked up the story on its front page the following day under the headline: “MPs’ anger as Christian girl forced into Muslim foster care.” The former Mail Online columnist and commentator Katie Hopkins tweeted an image of the front page, asking: “Which inidual at Tower Hamlets was responsible for the abuse of this little girl?”The Daily Mail and Mail Online did not have a photograph of the girl at the heart of the case. Instead, they used a stock picture of a Muslim family to illustrate the story in print and online. But they altered the image to cover the woman’s face with a veil.Khatun Sapnara, a family court judge, took the rare step of publishing a court order that contained details contradicting the original reporting of the case.The child’s maternal grandmother was revealed to be a “non-practising Muslim”. It emerged that the grandmother did not speak English, with the order saying she required a translation of the document. The grandmother also expressed a desire to “return to her country of origin and care for the child there”.Miqdaad Versi, who leads the MCB’s work on media reporting on Islam and Muslims, said: “While Ipso’s ruling on this shameful incidence of anti-Muslim reporting is welcome, their response thus far has been too little, too late. The note on the front page is welcome but cannot be considered even due prominence given this story was on four front pages.”It is understood that the foster carers at the heart of the case were left distraught and upset by the reports, and Tower Hamlets council received abusive phone calls.Will Tuckley, the chief executive of Tower Hamlets council, said: “We felt it was important to make the complaint to defend our foster carers and protect children in foster care, along with standing up for our erse communities.“From the start, we had significant concerns about the validity of the allegations about the foster carers. For example, one allegation was that they did not speak English, even though that is a prerequisite for any foster carers.“An investigation into all the allegations in the Times article later found them to be unsubstantiated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008c28c06f897ab7b6c102e27072c183cde7caa2/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3657e9b1dde3dd240a66ede182187643","title":"weve got more money swirling around how streaming saved the music industry","story":"‘It was a\u0026nbspdisaster,” said an executive called Per Sundin when asked to reflect on his career during the 00s. “A truly terrible time. I\u0026nbspfired more than 250 people. They were dark days: we’d be invited to dinner somewhere and my wife would say to me: ‘Don’t tell anyone what you do for a\u0026nbspliving.’”What ignoble occupation had Sundin chosen? Arms dealer? Cigarette manufacturer? CEO of Enron? Not quite: he was the head of Universal Music’s Nordic operation. The “disaster” he was talking about was working for a\u0026nbsprecord label when CD sales were in\u0026nbspdecline.Sundin’s fatalistic outlook was reflected across the music industry. Despite the fact that artists such as Adele and Rihanna were selling millions of records, music companies seemed perennially glum. As revenues declined, they lashed out, fighting legal battles with teenagers who illegally downloaded music and investing in propaganda campaigns to try to teach pesky young people the value of intellectual property. At one point, they worked with the animator Aardman to create a\u0026nbspfree iPhone game called Music Inc, where you attempt to manage a\u0026nbspband, but always fail because of online\u0026nbsppiracy.For decades, a\u0026nbspjob in music had been some of the most fun you could have as an adult. Labels were charging up to £20 for a CD, raking in hundreds of millions of pounds. And they typically received the lion’s share. When Guy Hands, a private equity manager, arrived at EMI in 2007, he wondered why hundreds of thousands of pounds were being spent on floral arrangements until he realised that “fruit and flowers” was accounting slang for drugs, sex workers and other items otherwise difficult to put on an expenses claim. Parties, hedonism and drug use were part of the job.Then, in the space of a\u0026nbspdecade, the music industry essentially collapsed\u0026nbsp– in the US, music’s biggest market, annual revenues fell from $14.6bn in 1999 to $6.3bn in 2009. Some artists still did OK, particularly those who focused on live shows, merchandise and brand endorsements, but labels had to dramatically cut costs. At EMI, Hands did away with the slush fund as well as almost half the workforce. At the label Per Sundin ran, the majority of the team was laid off. The expense accounts, the marketing budgets, the joy of taking a\u0026nbsppunt on a\u0026nbspweird band of misfits in the hope something magical might happen\u0026nbsp– it was all over. Chart music became safer the bestselling records of the 2010s have all been by middle-of-the-road acts with lots of “nan appeal”: Adele, Ed Sheeran, Michael Bublé and Take\u0026nbspThat.So does that mean we’re back to the glory days of Britpop, private jets and swimming pools full of cocaine? It doesn’t seem that way. There is money sloshing around, but it is not ending up in the places you might expect. Certain genres of music and types of artist are experiencing a\u0026nbspboom, while others remain destitute. It’s a\u0026nbspworld where Nordic cloud-rappers and South American reggaeton artists are watching their bank balances grow, whereas young, hyped guitar bands are struggling.The balance of power has shifted in all kinds of unexpected ways. What has happened, in the space of a\u0026nbspcouple of years, is the biggest change to the industry since the launch of\u0026nbspNapster. Where is all the money ending up? “Five years ago, the kinds of artists we work with wouldn’t see a\u0026nbsppenny until their album came out\u0026nbsp– and even then the album would have to do really well to make any money back,” says Sahil Varma, who works in A\u0026ampR for a mid-sized London based independent label, 37 Adventures. “Now, you’re making money from day\u0026nbspone.”He gives the example of Jones, a soulful singer-songwriter signed to the label. She is not a big artist she plays mid-sized venues in London and her debut album failed to make the Top 200. But on Spotify she has been streamed more than 70m times. “That equates to revenue of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Five years ago, with such low sales, she would have been dropped the week after her album came out. Brands have started looking at Spotify plays, too, so she is doing some stuff with Barbour. Now she has a\u0026nbspsteady income.” Varma says there are thousands of artist like Jones, who just a\u0026nbspfew years ago would have had to get other\u0026nbspjobs.This was always the promise of the streaming revolution. When Spotify launched in 2008, it pledged to defeat music piracy and ensure that artists got paid for their music\u0026nbsp– but it quickly emerged that what they were willing to pay artists was a\u0026nbspcouple of thousandths of a\u0026nbsppenny for each stream. There is a\u0026nbspbig debate over exactly how many thousandths\u0026nbsp– the latest survey by Digital Music News suggests that Apple Music pays $0.00783 and Spotify pays $0.00397. However, Rolling Stone has reported that artists and labels with greater clout in the industry are getting better rates. When I\u0026nbspask Tim Dellow, at the indie label Transgressive (home to Foals and Flume), he says that they are “on a\u0026nbsppar” with the majors. What remains true is that the biggest artists will have more favourable deals with their labels, allowing them to see a\u0026nbspbigger percentage of royalties, just as in the CD\u0026nbspera.Whatever the specifics, we are talking about tiny amounts of money, especially compared with CD sales. Initially, artists revolted, with, for example, Thom Yorke removing his solo album The Eraser from Spotify in 2013, after its producer, Nigel Godrich, complained the service favoured established acts and didn’t support new artists. Some of the biggest artists in the world\u0026nbsp– Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyoncé\u0026nbsp– followed suit, withholding their releases from streaming platforms either temporarily or indefinitely. Smaller artists signed to big labels were essentially powerless to choose whether their music went on to the service or not, and complained that labels were raking in big profits from Spotify while artists were seeing\u0026nbspscraps.But, over time, it has become clear that the fraction of a\u0026nbsppenny you receive from a\u0026nbspstream can’t be seen in the same context as the royalty on a CD sale. The money an artist made from a\u0026nbspphysical album was a\u0026nbspone-off payment within weeks of it being released, this revenue frequently dried\u0026nbspup.On Spotify, every time a listener wants to play the song, the artist gets a\u0026nbsptiny bit of money. If a\u0026nbsplistener adds the song to one of their own playlists, that can mean it will be repeatedly revisited over a\u0026nbsplifetime. If it gets added to one of Spotify’s curated mood playlists – Acoustic Spring, for example – the artist can expect tens of millions of plays. Acts whose biggest hits came well before the streaming era are banking huge new revenues from their existing catalogue. Fleetwood Mac have 11\u0026nbspmillion monthly listeners that’s more than Stormzy, George Ezra or Harry Styles. They will collect a\u0026nbsphuge cheque every month without doing\u0026nbspanything.There are ways to exploit the system, too. “Almost every track we release, we then release in an acoustic version a\u0026nbspfew weeks later,” says Varma. “The acoustic version will end up on different playlists to the main version\u0026nbsp– ones such as Sunday Chilled, and often it will get more\u0026nbspstreams.”Some bigger artists have taken this “moneyball” approach to extremes. Not content with the 1.7bn streams his song Shape of You has had on the site, Ed Sheeran released an acoustic version (74m streams), a\u0026nbspreggaeton version for the Latin market (69m), a\u0026nbspversion with a Stormzy verse (50m), a Major Lazer version for dancehall playlists (48m) and three further dance remixes (32m streams).When just the remixes of one Sheeran song get more streams than some artists will have in their entire career, you can see why big labels are excited. Analysts say the biggest artists, such as Sheeran and Drake, have received in excess of $50m from Spotify before other streaming services are factored in. Sheeran’s label, Warner music, took $1.3bn from streaming alone last\u0026nbspyear.“Our catalogue has become so much more valuable,” says Alec Boateng, the co-head of A\u0026ampR at Atlantic Records. “That means we’ve got more money swirling around the whole company, allowing us to invest pretty heavily in A\u0026ampR and\u0026nbspdevelopment. We’re patient with artists – and being patient can be expensive. The new income makes us feel a\u0026nbspbit more comfortable spending time working with an artist to develop\u0026nbspthem.”The way that A\u0026ampRs are finding new artists is changing, too. Today, every major label has at least one analytics expert, whose job it is to follow trends on the streaming platforms and flag up any unsigned artists who are performing well. It means that a\u0026nbspkid from nowhere who uploads a\u0026nbspsong to Spotify that does well can find every label in the world descending on them, trying to sign a\u0026nbspdeal.“If you walked into any major label meeting this week, the thing they’d be talking about is how ‘Spotify-friendly’ an artist is,” says Varma. “By that, they mean: can they get on Spotify’s playlists, such as New Pop Revolution or Chilled Pop?” Artists such as Nils Frahm, a\u0026nbsprelatively obscure German composer, gets more than 2.5m monthly streams from appearing on playlists such as Peaceful Piano and Songs for\u0026nbspSleeping.Music used to be dominated by audiences with the most spending power\u0026nbsp– so middle-class, middle-aged people, buying albums at Tesco as part of their weekly shop, often decided what topped the charts. Now, Afrobeat, Danish rap, hundreds of genres of niche electronic music and particularly British urban music are flourishing commercially, without having to make any concessions to the\u0026nbspmainstream.“Before, you had to get on mainstream radio, have a\u0026nbspcertain style or sound,” says Boateng. “It’s allowing for a\u0026nbspmore erse proposition for British music and a\u0026nbspwider range of people who are stars. A\u0026nbspgeneration are coming through and feeling\u0026nbspfree.”Even artists who had been written off by the industry are finding an afterlife on streaming. After her much-hyped debut, the BBC Sound of 2010 winner, Little Boots, failed to make the Top 40 with her second record and was dropped by her label. Now she releases her own music to a\u0026nbspsmall but committed\u0026nbspfanbase.“Before, I\u0026nbspmight have sold a\u0026nbspton of records, but none of that money went to me after I\u0026nbspgot my advance and I\u0026nbsphad very little say in how the money was spent,” she says on the phone from Los Angeles, where she now lives. “Now, when I\u0026nbsprelease something, I\u0026nbsphave to pay a\u0026nbsppercentage to my distributor, but most of it ends up with me. It’s not a\u0026nbsphuge amount, and I\u0026nbspthink it should be higher, but I\u0026nbsphave control and I\u0026nbsphave transparency. If I\u0026nbspknow I’m going to get 5,000 streams of a\u0026nbsptrack I\u0026nbspcan do the maths and say: that’s this amount of money, so I\u0026nbspcan spend this amount of money on a\u0026nbspnew EP and project how much I’ll make back. I’m like a\u0026nbspboutique business.”Indeed, streaming has allowed artists such as Chance the Rapper, Skepta, Stormzy and Novelist to release music without signing to a\u0026nbsptraditional label, with hundreds of smaller artists successfully following a\u0026nbspsimilar path. Are labels not worried that streaming, while providing a\u0026nbspshort-term bump, will make them\u0026nbspobsolete?“It’s definitely a\u0026nbspchallenge for labels to persuade artists that signing a\u0026nbsprecord deal will be useful to their careers, but I\u0026nbspthink that’s a\u0026nbspgood thing,” says Boateng. “It makes us clear about what we’re trying to achieve. Because artists can see that they’ll earn a\u0026nbspcertain amount of money without any involvement from a\u0026nbsplabel, I\u0026nbspmake an understanding with an artist about what I’m offering. Helping them make the best music they can make, challenging them, introducing new creative relationships\u0026nbsp– that’s where the value lies. Sometimes you’ll get an artist who isn’t interested and they might walk away, but then others, who ambition-wise are thinking a\u0026nbspbit more globally, they can see what we bring to the\u0026nbsptable.”I wonder if this all sounds too good to be true\u0026nbsp– can streaming really be making things better for small artists, big artists and labels? Boateng says there aren’t really any losers, but some music managers and label staff I\u0026nbspspeak to say that if you don’t fit neatly into Spotify playlists, it can be a\u0026nbsplot harder to make an impact. This is particularly true if you’re an unusual indie band whose record someone might once have bought as a\u0026nbspstatus symbol, but not listened to that often. Spotify’s hip-hop playlist Rap Caviar, described by Vulture as “the most influential playlist in music”, has 9.3 million subscribers. The service’s Punked playlist, described as “vital, angry new music from the bleeding edge of modern punk”, has fewer than 5,000.There are lots of small ways Spotify has changed the way music is made. The intros of songs have become shorter to stop listeners skipping a\u0026nbsptrack with a\u0026nbspslow buildup. Albums have got longer, often clocking in at more than 20 tracks, simply because listening to a 20-track album generates twice as much revenue as listening to a 10-track one. Acts with global appeal obviously perform much better than those who are only popular in one country, which means region-specific sounds can lose out. The creation of so many activity-based playlists (music for running, music for relaxing) has also proven challenging for artists who make abrasive music. “It’s undoubtedly easier to programme ‘mood-based’ tunes than music that’s unignorable, interruptive and commands your full attention rather than passively soundtracking another activity,” says\u0026nbspDellow.In practice, this has meant that electronic and urban artists are performing better than they would without streaming whereas local alternative acts are struggling. A\u0026nbspband such as Pale Waves, fifth on the BBC Sound of 2018 tastemakers poll with lots of radio play and written about extensively in the music press, have 428,000 monthly listeners. 6ix9ine, a Brooklyn “SoundCloud rapper” who is barely played on UK radio, has 6.1\u0026nbspmillion.For Dellow, whose label signs mostly alternative acts, this just means they can’t give up on other revenue streams, including physical sales. “In a\u0026nbspsense, we have two markets: those who were previously just listening to music on the radio and not going to shows or buying albums – and that’s great, and they’re easier to reach now – but also a\u0026nbspmarket of diehard obsessives who I’d love to see still supporting an artist with a\u0026nbsppurchase if they’ve been repeatedly streaming and enjoying a\u0026nbsprelease.”Few insiders would air their worries about Spotify on the record, citing the sensitivity of the relationship. The shadowy decision-making process by Spotify playlist compilers is a\u0026nbspconcern, with so much power concentrated in the hands of a\u0026nbspfew, often unidentified, people. Spotify, which has 3,000 employees, refused repeated requests for an interview. (“No one from the team is available,” its publicist\u0026nbspsaid.)Varma strikes another note of caution: although previously artists weren’t making much money from record sales, they were able to develop a\u0026nbspfinancial connection with their fans through touring or merchandise. Now that’s being lost. “Streaming often has no bearing on whether people want to buy tickets or a\u0026nbspphysical album,” says Varma. “The audience is pretty passive for most huge streaming acts. For Jones, we found out that many people streaming her didn’t even know who she was they were streaming her on a\u0026nbspplaylist alongside 50 other\u0026nbspsongs.”Still, even the insiders I\u0026nbspspeak to who do express reservations say that the overall benefits of streaming outweigh the negatives. There is a\u0026nbspsense that streaming has created a\u0026nbspmore democratic music industry one in which artists can make money with or without a\u0026nbsplabel, and where the spending power of a\u0026nbspgenre’s audience doesn’t affect how much money can be\u0026nbspmade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91237590f13eb6f354fdbac71a2576ec01839599/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de57831e9d8b7ec428d6bbcf3f21eed","title":"beyond belief brexit app for eu nationals wont work on iphones","story":"MEPs say problems with app is further proof of Home Office’s poor grasp of technology A mobile phone app for EU nationals seeking to stay in the UK after Brexit – claimed to be as user-friendly as “an online account at LK Bennett” – will not work on iPhones, Home Office officials have admitted.After arriving late for a meeting in Brussels to reassure MEPs of the efficiency of the British government, officials from Amber Rudd’s department conceded that a key function on the app would not work on the phone brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP who attended the meeting, said one Home Office official had suggested applicants could “borrow someone else’s” phone to complete the registration. “It is beyond belief,” Bearder told reporters.The group of officials, who were late due to a delayed Eurostar, were in Brussels to demonstrate to MEPs the functions of the new Home Office app in order to build confidence. Rudd had insisted that using the Home Office app would be as easy for the 3 million EU nationals in the UK as setting up an online account at LK Bennett, the clothes retailer. She also said it had been “extensively tested”, but Home Office officials admitted they had not yet begun mass testing of the app. They also said they would be hiring 1,000 caseworkers for a customer service centre for EU citizens, although they had not yet begun this process. However, the fact that the app does not work on Apple devices has highlighted what many say is the government’s poor record with technology.EU citizens who have tested the app say it requires just a small amount of information, such as a scan of a passport, address, email address and a selfie to match the passport picture. The system then matches the biographical details with HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs records to give the applicant an instant answer as to whether their application has been successful. However, it has emerged that because Apple will not enable its technology to read the chip on modern passports, the registration can only be completed on an Android phone. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said he would be writing to Theresa May this week about a series of wider concerns, including the £72 cost of registering, and the need for every member of a family to inidually apply for settled status.Verhofstadt said: “The treatment of the Windrush generation under UK immigration law has unfortunately created renewed anxiety among EU citizens in the UK and shows why we have to get this right. The European parliament will closely scrutinise developments and work to ensure sufficient guarantees are in place to avoid the repetition of such a situation for EU citizens.”The London MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties committee, said: “In my opinion, there is a need for more investment. They need to understand the political immensity of this, they need to understand that there is no history globally of registration systems based on this technology working.”One person in the meeting is said to have quipped: “It’s like the Irish border – they are trying to solve the problem with technology and we know it won’t work.”Moraes added that he was deeply concerned that the government was registering EU citizens on the basis of secondary rather than primary legislation, allowing the laws to be changed in the future.Under the withdrawal agreement, EU nationals will have recourse to the European court of justice should they have complaints about their treatment, but the scandal over the Windrush generation has illustrated the dangers in the longer term, Verhofstadt said.It is understood that the iPhone compatibility issue was known about at the app’s inception. “We’re speaking to Apple to try and get this resolved,” a Home Office spokesman said.In its statement, the department added that “technology will play an important role” in the identification element of registration, but it was also making “non-digital” routes available to all applicants, including sending a passport through the post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e671900cb96e7d38124f0da231d870eade2a80e9/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a087a7ac5a40cd0875b8e7f9fc3ff0a4","title":"pmqs may corbyn david davis amber rudd windrush questioned by commons brexit committee politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs, Amber Rudd giving evidence to MPs on Windrush and David Davis giving evidence to MPs on BrexitQ: You put forward two customs ideas.

He says the commission has set out its “opening position”.Q: Negotiations on a treaty for the trade deal will spill over into the transition, won’t they?Davis says he does not accept that.He says there are six months between the withdrawal agreement being agreed and Brexit.He says it is not the government’s intention to allow the trade negotiations to spill over into the transition.He says he wants the political agreement on trade in the autumn to be very detailed.It should be possible to turn that into a treaty within six months, he says.Davis says he does not expect to have a “legal text” of a future trade agreement at the time of the withdrawal agreement. There will be a political declaration covering this, he says.He says the EU cannot sign a trade deal until after the UK leaves the EU.Q: So it won’t be legally binding?Davis says it may not be legally binding, but it will be politically binding.Q: Will the motion by amendable?Davis says, if Benn knows how to put forward an unamendable motion, he will take a tutorial.Q: And will the government take any amendment seriously if that gets passed?Davis says the government would not have a vote if it were not going to take it seriously.Hilary Benn, the committee chair, opens the session.Q: How long will parliament have to consider the withdrawal agreement before the “meaningful vote”?Davis starts by saying he will have to leave after an hour and a half.

Holloway, a supporter of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, also said that a rise in street homelessness was driven by eastern European immigration, claiming that many migrants from that region preferred to sleep rough than pay for accommodation.He said mental illness and drug addiction were “real ingrained problems” behind homelessness that needed to be tackled to solve the crisis.Holloway, who told MPs he had spent a number of nights during the parliamentary recess in February sleeping on the streets as part of a television programme on street homelessness, said: “One observation I do have, if you are able-bodied and of sound mind there are all sorts of services – not quite 24 hours a day – that make it possible to sleep out. “I’m 52, I was in the army to be honest for me sleeping rough in central London is a lot more comfortable than going on exercise in the army.“But if you’re mentally ill or you are old or you are personality disordered then it is a very different thing. Or if you’re drug addicted it is very difficult. We have to accept that some people are able to sleep rough because there are resources to do so.”Holloway’s comments come after research revealed at least 78 homeless people died on the streets and in temporary accommodation this winter, bringing the number of recorded homeless deaths to more than 300 since 2013.Challenged by the Labour MP Laura Smith, Holloway acknowledged that he was not saying “even a large minority of the homeless are there because there are resources for them” but added “we’re going to get absolutely nowhere on this, in solving the problem in getting to the people who are most needy if we just continue to just talk about the homeless and feel sorry for everybody”.He later said there was a link between the scaling back of mental health services and the rise of homelessness. He said in February he took some cardboard to Covent Garden and “bedded down” for the night under the awning of St Paul’s church. The MP said he had first attempted this nearly 27 years ago as a television reporter for ITN’s World In Action. He said that compared with the early 90s, the majority of rough sleepers were “foreign nationals”.Holloway, who faced criticism in 2015 for claiming asylum seekers often holidayed in the country from which they had supposedly fled, said: “As I wandered round as shawls and brand new trainers who were handed out I honestly didn’t hear English being spoken by anybody. I heard east European languages. I heard Arabic. And I heard Italian.”He later said: “If we’re to be honest about the correlation between immigration and rising numbers of street homeless, it’s no surprise to me that 1,950 rough sleepers in 2016-2017 were migrants from Romania, Poland and Lithuania. When people are far from home and familial support structures, homelessness is a much greater risk.“Some migrants do indeed sleep on the streets by choice, preferring to sleep rough than to pay for accommodation.”On the same topic, he said: “On the subject of people from eastern Europe, perhaps it’s time to ask ourselves whether it’s exploitative to build an economy on cheap labour provided by those who can barely afford to accommodate themselves in our country. “Of course you could argue these people are not strictly homeless because they might have a home back home but that’s their reality when they’re here.”Holloway’s claim that the majority of homeless were foreign nationals was challenged by the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn, who said UK-wide this was not the case.Holloway said during his experience on the streets in February he was taken to a hostel in Hither Green, which he said was less comfortable than sleeping rough. “When I left there I was quite relieved, the thought of potentially sleeping days and weeks on the floor in a cramped room between a refrigerator and french windows did not appeal to me,” he said. “I can completely see how if you’re able-bodied and of sound mind it would be much more appealing to sleep under the awning of St Paul’s in Covent Garden because there you have freedom.”Holloway said “people’s generosity can sometimes be as much part of the problem as part of the solution”.“Begging is part of the problem,” he said. “You can make – if you’re able-bodied – quite a lot of money from begging on the streets of London. So generosity of members of the public is a factor in this. Generosity can be enabling.”Holloway did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049608569b2e71db85e48ad0b6ce859044121630/89_10_2818_1691/master/2818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ad6b0f7f9a4dfd9cd89be59bf89e32","title":"brexit blamed record number eu nurses give up britain","story":"UK said farewell to 4,000 nurses and midwives from European Economic Area in past year, with only 800 arrivingRecord numbers of nurses and midwives from EU27 countries quit Britain last year, fuelling fears that a Brexit brain drain will deepen the NHS’s already chronic staffing crisis.A total of 3,962 such staff from the European Economic Area (EEA) left the Nursing and Midwifery Council register between 2017 and 2018. The register tracks who is eligible to work in those areas of healthcare in the UK.“It feels that efforts to boost the number of nurses are being dragged down by a botched Brexit,” said Janet Davies, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing.The government’s refusal to detail the rights that the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain will have once the UK leaves the EU in March next year is a key cause of the loss of EU staff, she added. “Nurses returning home, or giving Britain a miss entirely, are doing so because their rights are not clear enough.” Brexit emerged as a key reason why EU-trained staff are stopping working in the UK in interviews the NMC conducted with 3,496 people who left the register between June and November 2017. The NMC figures bear out the much greater difficulty hospital trusts are having recruiting nurses from Europe, particularly from countries where many have come from in recent years – notably Italy, Portugal and Spain.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “These figures are yet more worrying evidence of the huge impact that the government’s shambolic approach to Brexit is having for our NHS. The government should have made clear straight after the referendum that these staff were valued and welcome but instead ministers dithered and delayed and now we see a huge fall in the number of staff coming to work here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b370ff77c281273dcdc90793a57dadf5cf44702/0_331_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be33c368826ec397a1ce56fad741aea","title":"party leaders urge theresa may to act on childhood obesity","story":"Jeremy Corbyn among those seeking curbs on TV advertising for junk food and discount deals A ban on buy-one-get-one-free offers on junk food, as well as strict new rules on how and when it can be advertised, are among a host of measures aimed at tackling childhood obesity proposed by the leaders of the main opposition parties in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday.The letter, coordinated by the celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver, also calls for action that would make healthier foods cheaper and easier to recognise, adding that the NHS is struggling to cope with the burgeoning obesity crisis.“We don’t agree on everything, but we do agree on this: If we don’t act now, the current generation of young children could well live shorter lives than their parents,” the letter to Theresa May says.It was signed by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as well as the heads of the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats, Nicola Sturgeon and Vince Cable, and the joint leaders of the Green party, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.“We are writing to urge you to take bold action to tackle one of the greatest health challenges of our time. A crisis which is putting immense pressure on the NHS as it approaches its 70th birthday,” they write.Saying a raft of measures needed to be introduced en masse to tackle the problem, they say they would support the prime minister if she banned multi-buy offers on junk food, stopped adverts for it before 9pm and online, and prohibited the use of popular cartoon characters and celebrities in ads.Among other proposals, they call for the tax system to be “used to make healthy food cheaper and discourage unhealthy choices both at home and on our high streets”.The leaders also say the levels of sugar, calories, salt and fat in junk food should be lowered overall, while more training should be given to medical staff to help people with nutrition.A government source told the Times many of the opposition proposals were already in the pipeline as part of its anti-obesity drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaca7929d42f0fa8be151783cb3a3d97f3f56262/158_322_4996_2998/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1aea3ece89558dd44f48cc4be8560f3e","title":"england suspected ball tampering australia perth alastair cook","story":"Alastair Cook has admitted to suspicions among the England team of ball-tampering by Australia during the Ashes series.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are all serving lengthy bans after the latter was caught using sandpaper on the ball during the Cape Town Test against South Africa in a premeditated plan to obtain reverse swing.Smith, the Australia captain, insisted it was a one-off. Asked if he believed that to be the case, Cook pointed to the third Ashes Test, where England were bowled out on a final day that had been delayed by rain, as one instance that was queried by his team-mates during their 4-0 defeat.“We did think in Perth, when the outfield was wet after the rain, they managed to get the ball reversing. I didn’t see anything,” Cook said. “But there’s also that thing about whether reverse swing comes the quicker you bowl. Back in 2005 we had SimonJones and Freddie Flintoff, who were quicker than the Aussies – they managed to get reverse swing and the Aussies didn’t, so we have to be very careful there.Cook will make his return for Essex at Hampshire on Friday in preparation for what will be a 13th summer of international cricket. But, though the sport’s landscape is shifting and a new selector is in place, his hunger is unabated. By his own admission the recent tour of New Zealand passed by Cook somewhat with a top score of 14 in four innings. And while he gorged on 244 not out during the Boxing Day Ashes Test, his winter overall was one of fleeting time spent at the crease.As a result the 33-year-old accepts that murmurs have again resurfaced as to his longevity but, while there is a new man in Ed Smith heading the selection process, Cook insists his own challenges remain the same as ever.“My job never changes,” said Cook, speaking at an event to mark the return of Yorkshire Tea national cricket week (18-22 June). “It’s to score runs at the top of the order. If someone taps me on the shoulder and tells me they don’t want me to open for England, it is going to hurt at this precise moment because I want to carry on.“The hunger and desire is still there but no one has a God-given right to play for England. You have to score the runs to justify your place. Since I’ve come home I’ve started to look at my preparation. Have I got it right? Do I need to change things? Because that’s the right way to do it. I will never sit here and say I’ve cracked the game or will ever be perfect.”With a paucity of alternatives it still seems a given that Cook will take the field when England host Pakistan at Lord’s next month and, should he do so, he would equal Allan Border’s record of 153 consecutive matches.It would be the latest testament to the fitness and mental obduracy of England’s record run-scorer but in an era of Twenty20 – or even the ECB’s proposed new 100-ball tournament – the question remains as to where the next Test players will come from.While he is the latest centrally-contracted player to offer predictable support to England’s new short-form competition – after Joe Root, Eoin Morgan and Stuart Broad – and believes social media would have derided Twenty20 back in 2003 had it existed, Cook has been pondering the same thing.He said: “Why would you put yourself through the stresses and strains of the five-day game when you can play three hours or two and a half hours of crash-bang-wallop? For a deep-down cricket fan, it’s very different from what we know. But that doesn’t mean it can’t go back the other way. There are a few guys now just playing white-ball cricket but there’s very few who can do that. For most people, to earn a living you’re going to have to play four-day cricket as well.”Cook believes there is a decent talent pool from which Ed Smith can construct a Test side but he believes patience will be needed if they are to match the side who last beat Australia away in 2010-11.“There were probably 14 cast-iron Test cricketers you could have picked from, with a lot of skill and experience. We are probably not at that stage. There are a lot of unanswered questions,” he said, “but I do think the talent is there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd36ce2aae33329243003d21b63091d14c02ec79/310_982_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b12203b30d818022da857082ff5acb","title":"theatre of the disbelieved monkeywood","story":"When a rape trial ends in acquittal, what do the anonymous women who made the claims do next? They are the women whose voices we rarely hear, whose faces we are not allowed to print in the newspaper. A rape trial ends in an acquittal. The accused gives a defiant statement on the court steps. But from the woman whose allegations began the judicial process we hear nothing. Regardless of the verdict, she remains entitled to lifelong anonymity – unless she is prosecuted for making a false allegation. She may want to tell her story but the media cannot, will not, publish it. She has not been believed, and to give her publicity would be to suggest that the jury got it wrong. A new site-specific play premiering in Bolton this week gives a platform to the disbelieved. Trial, by Manchester’s award-winning Monkeywood Theatre, takes the stories of real women who have suffered sexual violence and explores the devastating impact of being portrayed as a liar. Staged in Bolton’s grand council chamber, which was once a court room, it presents four inidual stories, woven together with excerpts from a transcript of a real sexual abuse trial.All identifying features have been stripped from the transcript to avoid a libel claim from the defendant, but the case centred on historic allegations made by a series of women who said they had been groomed by him when they were girls.Monkeywood met one of the complainants, who is now in her 40s, and had told the court she was abused between the ages of eight and 12. She has given her blessing for her story to be used and now works with survivors of sexual violence, according to Monkeywood co-artistic director, Sarah McDonald Hughes, who has written one of the four mini plays that comprise Trial.McDonald Hughes will play the role of a girl who wakes up, having been raped on a night out. She can’t remember what’s happened at all. “It’s about the process of going to court and what happens in the court process,” says the playwright. “Really it’s about how she starts off loving being a girl and loves life and feels really powerful and in control and actually she learns through this experience that you can’t be that free when you’re a girl.”A second story, written and performed by Rosina Carbone, is set around a school reunion where a woman remembers when her friend was falsely accused of sleeping with a boy. “It explores the idea of frigidity and the double standards girls face,” says Carbone. A third story, by Nisa Cole, tells the story of a girl who is groomed and tells her teacher, only to be accused of not telling the truth. The fourth, by Eve Steel, looks at the lifelong effect of being a witness in a sex abuse trial.For legal reasons, the theatre company cannot link any of the stories with their real-life inspirations and insist the four protagonists are composite characters. The company insists it is not suggesting that all men accused of rape are guilty. “No one is saying that it isn’t awful to be falsely accused. But if you look at the percentage of people who make false allegations it is tiny, compared with the number of rape allegations which end in a conviction,” says McDonald Hughes. “This isn’t a play about how how times men are falsely accused of rape. We are telling stories we feel are largely untold and unseen on stage, characters who you don’t see and if you do see, are usually portrayed in a certain way.”While developing the show the writers have worked with Rape Crisis and consulted survivors of sexual violence throughout. “We’ve checked meticulously for truth,” says McDonald Hughes. They have also held workshops with young people, exploring their own experiences. So far the feedback has been positive, though some victims said “it’s even worse than you’re making it seem”, she remembers.Eyebrows may be raised at the choice of a male director, Monkeywood’s Martin Gibbons, who admits he still has reservations about that.But McDonald Hughes says it’s not a problem: “I can see the argument for having a female director, but this isn’t a women’s issue. It’s really important that men engage with this. It’s everyone’s problem. With the whole #MeToo debate you often hear men talking out because they can imagine it was their sister or daughter and it makes me want to tear my hair out. You should care about it because she’s a person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c689d9124cca9254e30f39c3c6024b046ffd2f/37_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4fb9ffef62e0e056f29725c38e73cc","title":"the two pizza rule and the secret of amazons success","story":"Jeff Bezos’s firm is good at selling things to shoppers, but that is the tip of its commercial iceberg In the early days of Amazon, Jeff Bezos instituted a rule: every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasn’t to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But it’s the latter that really matters for Amazon.The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals.“You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms,” Evans notes. “You don’t need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.”Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what it’s great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things. The company calls this approach its “flywheel”: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it.Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). That’s the ision of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies – including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries).It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didn’t exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything.From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally.AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer. AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the “Snowmobile”, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazon’s cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes – that’s roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound – it turns out there’s no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph.While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazon’s actual website. Amazon Marketplace launched in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to put up their own wares on the site. The feature has expanded over the years to become a major plank in the company’s quest to be the “everything store” – the one destination on the internet you need to go to to buy anything in existence.Marketplace goes one better than the pizza rule, allowing Amazon to expand into new sectors without needing to employ a single extra employee. The variety of things sold on Amazon is now so huge that its internal computer scientists faced a problem. “E-commerce companies such as Amazon … process billions of orders every year,” a team of Amazon researchers wrote. “However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders.” The solution? Train an artificial intelligence purely to generate plausible fake orders, to better guess how to market brand-new products.Increasingly, then, Amazon resembles less a big-box retailer such as Tesco or Walmart, hovering at the edge of town sucking up commerce and killing the local high street, and more a shopping mall: independent retailers can exist, and even make a tidy living, but only if they get a slot in the mall itself – and if they always remember that the real moneymaker is the landlord.Since 2014, Amazon has added a third flywheel to its business: artificial intelligence. The company has always been near the leading edge of the industry, most obviously in its neural-network-powered recommendation algorithms. But, until recently, that approach was scattershot, segmented, and hardly world-class (think of the last time you bought something on Amazon only to have it recommended to you for weeks afterwards. “You like duvets? Why not buy 10 more?”). That changed when the company decided to build the hardware that would become the Echo. In classic Amazon fashion, it started at the end and worked backwards from there, writing a “press release” for the notional future product and then trying to figure out what expertise needed to be developed – or bought – to make it. Need a personal assistant? Buy Cambridge-based True Knowledge, once working on a Siri competitor, and you get Alexa. Require far-field voice recognition, letting you hear people on the other side of the room? Start working on that now, because no one’s really cracked the problem.Institutionally, the bulk of the Alexa AI team still sits under AWS, using its infrastructure and offering another tranche of digital services to third parties who want to build speech control into their devices. But the economies of scale that come to AI are unique. There’s the value to the data, of course: the more people use an Echo, the more speech samples it has to train with, and so the better the Echo becomes. And beyond that, machine learning technologies are so fundamental, and so general purpose, that every advancement Amazon makes ricochets throughout its business, increasing efficiency, opening up new fields, and suggesting further avenues of research.But nothing lasts forever, and even Amazon has its weak points. The two-pizza rule, for instance, may be a good strategy for building an infinitely expandable company, but it doesn’t lend itself to a pleasant, stress-free working environment. Amazon has long faced criticism over its treatment of warehouse workers: as with many companies in its sector, huge valuations and high-tech aspirations sit uneasily alongside the low-paid, low-skilled work that makes the company tick over. Where Amazon differs from companies such as Deliveroo, Apple and Facebook is that the highly skilled employees sitting in the headquarters have almost as many complaints. A New York Times exposé from 2015 described employees crying at their desks and suffering near-breakdowns from the pressure they were put under. The company’s rapid employee turnover is legendary, with insiders describing a sort of Forth Bridge of technical debt: someone leaves, and someone else has to rewrite all their code to make it understandable to the people still there – but by the time the rewrite is finished, the person doing the rewriting has also left, requiring someone else to start the whole process again.But the one thing that’s been true from day one is that Jeff Bezos sits at the top of the food chain, with direct control of a $740bn (£530bn) business matched by few other bosses. It would take a bold gambler to bet against the company right now."},{"url":null,"title":"bezoss empire how amazon became the worlds biggest retailer","story":"Amazon has shipped more than 400 items per second at its peak.

Pashinyan led nearly two weeks of protests against Serzh Sargsyan – Armenia’s most powerful politician for more than a decade – prompted by accusations that he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power.The latest protests will be a crucial test of whether the opposition can maintain its momentum after Sargsyan’s resignation. Karen Karapetyan, the acting prime minister and an ally of Sargsyan, suggested on Wednesday morning that a parliamentary election could be held to end the political crisis. “If Pashinyan is the people’s choice, the people can elect him,” he said.In a video appeal posted on Facebook after he led thousands of people on a march, Pashinyan said: “The Republican party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan’s resignation and wants to keep power.“We can’t agree on the appointment of this party’s representative as prime minister and we can’t allow this corrupted system to continue to exist.”He urged supporters to “come to the square and finish the velvet revolution”.Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sargsyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the prime minister to go in a televised exchange, before being imprisoned and then released. He had been due to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday.Sargsyan was a close ally of Vladimir Putin and Russia is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.The Armenian president, Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the former premier, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament.Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister, while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post. In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia’s closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said he was ready to be the country’s next prime minister “if people put this responsibility on me”, and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change.In Los Angeles, thousands of demonstrators attended a rally on Tuesday to mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555ea3f07572f719574350021c41ab846713bcb0/0_165_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a49a5ed6ef62317a91e312162f9875","title":"vanuatu landslide and flash flood hampers relief effort on ambae","story":"Manaro volcano rumbling, spewing torrents of ash, gas and rocks from its craterA landslide and flash flood on the Vanuatu island of Ambae is complicating evacuation efforts, with as many as 800 people now sheltering in emergency relief centres.Ambae Island is home to 11,000 people, and for the second time in six months Manaro volcano on top of Mount Lombenben has started rumbling, spewing torrents of ash, gas and rocks from its crater. The debris is causing breathing and health problems, and threatening livelihoods by burying vegetable plots and crops.The government has declared a three-month state of emergency while it works with non-governmental organisations to safely evacuate the island and secure new homes for displaced islanders who may never be able to return. Acting prime minister Jean Pierre Nirua said Vanuatu was the most vulnerable country in the world to natural disasters, and was currently stretched by responding to the clean-up of last month’s cyclone Hola and the unfolding Ambae emergency. According to the Vanuatu meteorology and geohazards department the volcano remains at level three, with a danger zone surrounding the cone of three kilometres. Due to eruption activity the cone of the volcano had widened, resulting in ash fall, gas, and acid rain, as well as a heightened risk of landslides and flash floods.Olivia Finau from the Vanuatu Red Cross said there was a likelihood it would remain active for some time, forcing the government to plan for the permanent relocation of Ambae Islanders to nearby Islands. Some neighbouring chiefs had already made offers of land suitable for relocation to the government.A reconciliation ceremony was staged last week between the Island chiefs of Santos and Ambae, after Santos Islanders took offence at the alleged ungratefulness of evacuees who stayed on their island last year, the Vanuatu Daily Post reports.Access to the island for NGOs and government officials is proving challenging after a local airline cancelled flights, forcing the government to charter a plane on Tuesday. Southern parts of Ambae Island were worst hit by ash fall, and Unicef workers on the ground reported people with asthma or other respiratory problems were having difficulty breathing.“It is really challenging for the affected community, it is their home and all they know, they’ve been there for their entire life,” said Uncief Pacific’s chief of communications Cate Heinrich, adding that there were more than 5,000 children on Ambae.“At the moment our priority is helping women and children who have been affected, making sure children have safe spaces and helping them begin to process and understand what is happening to their home, using techniques like drawing.”Many water sources have been contaminated by ash, with water needing to be trucked in or purified using tablets. Some schools were closed, and there was a sense of limbo as locals waited for the government to establish a time-line for the evacuation, which was being conducted much more slowly and safely than the DIY-style evacuation last year, said Heinrich.On Monday the Chinese ambassador Liu Quan presented a cheque for AU$120K to the Vanuatuan government to aid in the relief effort.The Australian government provided AU$3.2m to support early recovery efforts for those affected by the Ambae volcano last year, and is ready to give further assistance, a spokesperson said. The New Zealand government has provided more than NZ$1.5m in assistance, as well as technical support and relief supplies.Vanuatu is no stranger to natural disasters, and its 83 islands are stuck in the middle of hurricane alley and dot the border of the “ring of fire” – a belt around the Pacific prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d37f0b205ec3682f8d0c6a3f28b9b705bd64b/0_228_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab332e0ac7f7a33691799b00fc3ae29","title":"emmanuel macron goes to washington in pictures","story":"The French president and his wife Brigitte opened their pomp-filled three-day state visit with a double date with Donald and Melania Trump at George Washington’s house"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows collision on wellington quay in dublin","story":"  April 24, 2018Garda\u0026iacute pin driver to ground after car hits several vehicles in multiple incidents "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3473676.1524644671!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one of dublin 4 s most sought after houses left unoccupied for more decade","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t13 St Mary’s Road in Ballsbridge has been unoccupied for a decade. Photograph: Google Street Concerns are growing over the condition of a protected structure on one of Dublin 4’s most sought-after residential streets, which has been left unoccupied for more than a decade.The Victorian house at 13 St Mary’s Road in Ballsbridge has been in the possession of Permanent TSB since 2015, but despite growing property values has remained vacant.The house appears in poor repair and had been entered on Dublin City Council’s register of derelict sites until late last year, when the bank removed large amounts of rubble, litter and wooden hoardings from the front garden.However, the council said its conservation section will in the coming week carry out a more in-depth in inspection of the interior to determine if the house, which is on the city’s Record of Protected Structures, should be entered on its Buildings at Risk register, which aims to prevent the loss of heritage properties.Local resident Killian Mallin said he was shocked to discover the house had been removed from the Derelict Sites Register last year.“It has been empty and in a worsening condition for at least 10 years. But all it seemed to take was a clear-out of the front garden for it to be taken off the Derelict Sites register to me that is illogical when it is clearly so neglected.”While the house is unsightly, with a broken lintel above the front door and sections missing from the wooden side entrance door, the waste of a family home was the most frustrating aspect of the situation, said Mr Mallin.“This property would be a fantastic home for someone. Dublin is facing a housing crisis, with desperation even at the upper end of the market, yet it seems that unless a building is showing signs of imminent collapse the council won’t take action.”Local Fine Gael Cllr Paddy McCartan wrote to Permanent TSB last month asking its intentions in relation to the house, but said he has received no reply.“The bank has had control of this house for a few years now and it has a responsibility to address this situation. It is not good enough to clear the garden and leave it at that. In the current climate, any vacant premises which has the potential to be brought back into use should be a priority.”A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. However, it is understood that there are title issues with the property which have yet to be resolved.The house has been valued at €1.4 million in its current condition. A refurbished house two doors up went on the market last May at €1.9 million. Another house on the road was advertised for rent earlier this year asking €5,500 per month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3473663.1524641708!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judicial tensions flare up again","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Transport Shane Ross: warned he would walk away from Government at one point.

Image: Oireachtas TV. While they didn’t physically recoil from the images, some TDs found them utterly unacceptable.“Rubbish,” shouted Mattie McGrath at the offending graphics and the five miscreants displaying them. “You’re above the law!”The Leas-Cheann Comhairle sounded scandalised. “I may have to take action,” quivered Pat ‘the Cope’ Gallagher, reacting to what he saw as an act of “deliberate” provocation.Even the Tánaiste was aghast. When there was a break in the roaring, Simon Coveney leaned forward and, sounding like the best boy in class, he primly chided the culprits.“Stupid stunts like that do nothing to inform people.”Perhaps it was the way Simon said “stupid stunts” or maybe it was the prissy tone in which it was delivered, but his intervention made a lot of people giggle.The reason for this brief outbreak of unrest during an otherwise uneventful Leaders’ Questions was the decision by members of the SolidarityPeople Before Profit group to stage another of their capsule performances on the floor of the Dáil.Having earned critical acclaim with their seminal “Repeal the Eighth Jumpers” in 2016, the group struck out with a new production this\u0026nbspafternoon. But they were in that difficult second album territory – it was always going to be hard to recapture the moment of that first routine.But they made a spirited attempt.Blink and you would have missed this one. This time the five deputies – Cork TD Mick Barry wasn’t present – seemed a bit sheepish as they unfurled shocking pictures of an image which was removed from the side of arts centre on Monday as its presence compromised the organisation’s charitable status and consequently jeopardised its funding. This was because the artwork, by street artist Maser, addressed a political issue.It features the outline of a heart in red on a blue background with “Repeal the Eighth” written through it.“This country has an inglorious record of censorship, both artistic and political, and this parliament should be clear,” said Ruth Coppinger, “a piece of art was removed from an arts building in 2018 in a ruling more reminiscent of the Committee on Evil Literature of the 1920s.”Quoting George Orwell along the way, Coppinger asked the Taoiseach if he believed that “that art shouldn’t argue for social change and that charities shouldn’t either”.As she saw it, the view that this mural is outside the brief of an arts centre is a subjective one. And while this is the assertion of the chief executive of the Charities Regulator, she felt it was a subjective one because he is “someone who also has a long connection himself with the Catholic Church and a history of writing Catholic texts”.As Coppinger spoke, the tut-tutting began at the opposite end of the chamber, where McGrath and the Healy-Raes sit. They were joined by a handful off Fianna Fáil TDs, all of whom did not agree with the Socialist TD’s argument.She wanted the Taoiseach to review the decision to remove the mural and wondered if he could get to the bottom of how the artwork, in Temple Bar, “came under orchestrated attack, with all of the complaints being lodged on one day”.It began to sound like a row about holy pictures. “Are we back to the old days of de Valera, when the arts had to keep to the holiest traditions?” asked Ruth.“What was wrong with de Valera?” piped up Michael Healy-Rae (who is from a strong Fianna Fáil background.)“Or the Catholic Church?” added his brother, Danny.Coppinger said the Project Arts Centre did not have the funds to challenge the decision.“The campaign to repeal the Eighth might give you a bit of money,” quipped McGrath.The Dublin West TD called it “a remarkable double standard” that the Catholic Church could be “an active agent” in the referendum without having to register with the Standards in Public Office Commission, which secular groups must do. Many religious organisations are on the register of charities and seem to have no problem using their buildings to “propagate the anti-repeal position”.Leo Varadkar couldn’t help her. The decision to remove the mural was made by the Charities Regulator and he presumed it did not matter whether it was a pro-choice or anti-abortion painting on the wall of the arts centre.He wasn’t too put out by what happened. If anything, he reckoned that, because all the publicity, more people than might otherwise have been expected will see the image and read the message.Furthermore, he threw out an interesting prediction. “I’ve no doubt that the mural will appear elsewhere, perhaps somebody who has a private building may wish to make space available for the mural to be reinstated.”“While you can paint over a mural, you certainly can’t paint over an issue, and the issue is that nine women every day in Ireland are forced to travel overseas in order to end their pregnancies, and three women in Ireland every day – and the number is only rise into the future – are importing pills online and are taking them without medical supervision and guidance, often in their own homes.”At the end of her second and final question, Coppinger wondered what was actually offensive in the mural.As she said earlier, the irony of its removal was that there was a “proliferation of No posters which are offensive and upsetting”.Paraphrasing a famous Jack Nicholson line, Mattie scoffed at her. “You don’t like the truth.”The Taoiseach thought Maser’s artwork was fine. “Certainly, from my personal point of view, I don’t find the mural in any way offensive, but I don’t think it’s murals or posters that are going to change people’s minds or convince people on this issue.”(That being said, he won’t be adverse to a few thousand Leo posters hitting the nation’s lampposts at the next election.)In truth, if deputies really wanted to be offended, they could have stepped outside the Dáil chamber and walked to the main entrance. Right along the gates, almost as high as them, was a collection of the most lurid and graphic images of blood-soaked alleged foetal body parts.The groups of schoolchildren who visited Leinster House would have had to walk past these pictures on their way in.Some TDs may have approved of them.Yet not of small photocopies of an innocuous piece of art.Coppinger held up her page, then Paul Murphy, Richard Boyd-Barrett, Gino Kenny and Bríd Smith. They didn’t do it for very long and said nothing.But they had broken the rules. People complained.Outside the gates, there seemed to be a different set of rules.“I believe the Maser mural will actually be more popular as a result and I believe the message young people should take from it s to use it in the referendum to win a repeal vote,” said Coppinger.And she hoped she would be able to speak in the Dáil “and not be shouted down by a group of male deputies who can never actually be pregnant”.No. That would be a hope too far.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security How a mango mousse has exposed the delicate diplomacy of the North Korea summitA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitBoris Johnson calls for amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in UK for 10 yearsAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityRoyal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump and Emmanuel Macron toast friendship at state dinner organised by MelaniaWhat do we know about Alek Minassian, arrested after Toronto van attack?Toronto van attack victims: An \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 charity worker and a sports-loving grandmotherEuroMillions draw: Lucky Brit\u0026#39s numbers come in to scoop third highest  UK jackpot everPioneering prostate treatment for tens of thousands of men gets NHS green lightRoyal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39new deal\u0026#39 on Iran as Donald Trump blasts \u0026#39insane\u0026#39 current agreementAdmiral Harry Harris lined up to fill America\u0026#39s key South Korean envoy postTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedWhatsApp raising minimum age to 16 - but unclear how it will enforce age limitBritain to rival EU\u0026#39s Galileo space project by sending own satellite navigation system into spaceNew law could be made against upskirting in the UKAllison Mack attempted to recruit Emma Watson to join New York \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39Trump welcomes Macron with handshakes, hugs and kissesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"france unreliable lover wont replace britain americas primary","story":"As with any budding affair, the diplomatic love-in between French President Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, his enthusiastic American suitor, will raise expectations that “le bromance” could blossom into a more enduring relationship.Ever since Mr Macron stole a march on his European rivals by feting Mr Trump during last year’s Bastille Day celebrations with a candlelit dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower, the American leader has entertained a tendresse for the dynamic young French politician.This is evident from the lengths to which Mr Trump has gone to make Mr Macron and France’s first lady welcome during the first state visit he has hosted since becoming president.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet.

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It\u0027s beyond belief,” Ms Bearder said.The app, Home Secretary Amber Rudd pledged would be easy to use, will not function on iPhones because they do not have the capability to read the chip in a biometric passport.The revelation is likely to further lower the opinion of British immigration authorities in the eyes of European politicians and citizens, hot on the heels of damage done by the Windrush immigration scandal and erroneous deportation letters being sent to EU nationals last year.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Speaking after the Tuesday meeting Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator who requested the official visit to Brussels by the Home Office, said he would be writing to UK authorities to resolve various “question marks” about the registration process.The European Parliament says any system should be by way of “declaration” rather than application that the UK government would have to process.

If there wasn’t Brexit there shouldn’t be a special status for EU citizens in the future and there wouldn’t be a reason to apply for such a status.”He also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.The parliament also insisted that British citizens living abroad at the point of exit should be guaranteed full rights to freedom of movement across the EU rather than just for the country they’re currently resided in. One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?European confidence in British immigration authorities reached a new low following the Windrush scandal, but it was already dealt a blow last year after the Home Office accidentally sent letters to some EU citizens telling them they had no right to remain in the country.Ms May described the false deportation notices as an “unfortunate error” on the part of the Home Office and later sent other letters to EU nationals pleading for them to remain in “open and erse” Britain.Brexit negotiators ‘gave EU power to freeze UK out of Galileo project’Theresa May dismisses EU claims that the UK is delaying Brexit talksUK holding up Brexit talks with lack of clarity, Michel Barnier says Lords defeats government plans to scrap EU rights charter after BrexitEU agrees new trade deal with Mexico as Brexit loomsPound sterling falls to five week low against US dollar The prime minister and home secretary, Amber Rudd, have come under significant pressure after it was revealed that Home Office has been threatening to deport British residents, and their descendants, who arrived from the Commonwealth before 1973.Often children who travelled on a parent’s passport did not have to go through the same administrative process as their mother or father, meaning they lacked some documentary evidence in later life to prove their arrival.Problems reached crisis point amid the “hostile environment” policy instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary, which saw officials across all wings of government and even private landlords required to demand proof of immigration status before providing services.A raft of cases are now emerging of people who have every right to live in the UK being denied jobs, homes, medical treatment and even being threatened with removal because they have not had the right documents.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

She is carrying out the will of the British people but it’s hard to read what level of enthusiasm she has for it.“She is doing it, she has never indicated anything other than that, she said ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but she doesn’t – by her nature – express herself unduly emotionally.”He said it was a “good thing” that the leader can exercise “self control”, but his words come as Brexiteers seek to pressure Ms May into sticking to her commitment to leave the customs union.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The announcement, set for Wednesday, consists of £150 million of new money spread across the two years.Officials say the aid will be focused on keeping medical facilities in the region open, as well as training doctors and nurses – amid estimates that 478 health facilities have been attacked or destroyed and at around 830 health workers have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in 2011.Western countries plan to bypass Russia\u0027s UN veto over SyriaMinisters from dozens of countries across the world met with NGOs and donor countries on Tuesday in the EU capital on the first day of the so-called Brussels II summit.Opening the international meeting at a joint press conference UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura insisted that a political solution had to be found to the civil war“We\u0027re seeing in last few weeks, days, that military gains, territorial gains and military escalation do not bring a political solution, has not brought any change. On the contrary,” he said.Speaking at the same joint press conference, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, echoed Mr de Mistura’s comments, saying there was a need to “return to the political process under the UN auspices to start real, meaningful political negotiations that are clearly the only way forward for the country”.The first day of the summit mostly consisted of government liaising with NGOs and aid groups on priorities and strategies to help alleviate civilian suffering. Closing the Tuesday sessions, EU humanitarian and and crisis commissioner Christos Stylianides described the day’s sessions as “fruitful”.The British government’s message on the first day of the summit focused on Russia’s role in the conflict, with international development secretary Penny Mordaunt warning that “flagrant disregard for international norms” would cause more “misery and destruction”.Mordaunt said Britain wanted to defend a “global rules-based system that keeps all of us safe”.“Russia’s flagrant disregard for international norms and laws poses a grave threat to the global order we rely on for our collective security. In wielding its UN veto twelve times on Syria, it has given a green flag to Assad to perpetrate human rights atrocities against his own people,” she warned.“We’re here to address the urgent humanitarian needs in Syria and the wider region, but all of us here know that the only solution to end the suffering in Syria is a political settlement that brings peace. The longer they delay, the more people are going to die, and the more misery and destruction will be inflicted on Syria.”Syria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageSyria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, which was targeted by the US, UK and France air strikes.A Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center surrounded by papers and rubble.Firefighrers extinguish smoke that rises from the damage.

Calling for an immediate ceasefire, she is expected to say that “Syria is now one of the most dangerous places on earth for aid workers and medical staff”. She will continue: “Medical facilities and schools have been deliberately targeted, aid has been blocked to starve communities into submission, and rape and sexual violence have been deployed as routine weapons of war.“Today’s pledge of UK aid support will help keep medical facilities open in the face of relentless attacks so doctors and nurses can save the lives of innocent Syrians, as well as helping the millions of Syrian refugees sheltering in neighbouring countries. But today can’t only be about pledges of money and we cannot allow anyone to turn their backs on the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous.

Male blue monkeys, she added, probably arrived later after being kicked out of their own groups on reaching sexual maturity.“I kept coming back to the idea that if they are only supposed to mate with their own kind, then why did these red-tailed monkeys mate with the blue monkeys, especially if they had males of their own species around,” Prof Detwiler said. “The female red-tailed monkeys present as willing partners and they are not coerced or forced into copulation with blue monkeys.“Apparently, some female red-tailed monkeys were attracted to novel males with different faces and welcomed the sexual advances.”The research involved analysing DNA from the faeces of the primates.Zhongzhong and HuahuaChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences         Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences    Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences              Now Prof Detwiler believes studying how the two species have co-existed and merged could help in understanding hybridisation in general.She said the society provides “an amazing laboratory in nature to help us answer many questions about how species boundaries are maintained.She added: This research is very timely because hybridization often occurs in response to environmental changes, as we are seeing with climate change and modified landscapes—it is nature\u0027s way to respond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Alfie Evans latest: Queen asked to intervene, petition reaches 100,000                Alfie Evans FRESH HOPE: Court of Appeal AGREES to hear parents\u0027 caseSpeaking to reporters outside Alder Hey Children\u0026rsquos Hospital in Liverpool on Tuesday night, where Alfie is being treated, Mr Evans said his 23-month-old son had confounded doctors\u0026rsquo expectations when he continued to live after life support was withdrawn.\u0026ldquoThe court of appeal have reached out to us and said they are going to set back three judges to hear the case.\u0026ldquoIn reality, he could be in Italy right now. We all know the military air force are ready to take him and a team of doctors are there.\u0026ldquoWe\u0027ve also got a German air ambulance team, who attempted to take him in the first place, ready... the reality is these people are eager to get him out of the country and I\u0027m not giving up because Alfie\u0027s breathing away, he\u0027s not suffering.Mr Evans revealed that Alfie had at times needed to be helped with his breathing, adding: \u0026ldquoAt some point I had to give him mouth-to-mouth because his lips went blue and he was really fighting with his breathing so me and his mum were giving him mouth-to-mouth.During a separate three-hour hearing on Tuesday at the Family Division of the High Court in Manchester, Paul Diamond from the Christian Legal Centre suggested the alleged change in this position meant the court should consider its decision on allowing Alfie to travel abroad.The judge rejected claims from Tom Evans that his son was \u0026ldquosignificantly better than first thought Mr Diamond handed the court a witness statement from Mr Evans in which he suggested his son\u0026rsquos health was \u0026ldquosignificantly better than first thought since life support was withdrawn at 9:17pm on Monday, as he was continuing to live and breathe.But Mr Justice Hayden said in his ruling: \u0026ldquoThe sad truth is that it is not.\u0026ldquoWith little, indeed no hesitation, I reject that.Instead, the judge said Alfie\u0026rsquos continued life was a \u0026ldquoshaft of right and a \u0026ldquospecial opportunity for his parents to spend time with him, not the time for more legal manoeuvres.The judge also criticised the \u0026ldquomalign hand of one of the family\u0026rsquos advisers, law student Pavel Stroilov, who had, the court heard, been party to Mr Evans lodging a private prosecution of Alder Hey Hospital doctors, allegedly for murder.Mr Justice Hayden said that in fact the hospital had provided \u0026ldquoworld class care for Alfie.Tom Evans told reporters that Alfie had confounded doctors\u0027 expectationsFollowing the hearing, a spokesman for Alder Hey said it was working closely with the youngster\u0026rsquos parents, but that its \u0026ldquotop priority therefore remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout.In a statement Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said decisions to withold or withdraw treatment from a child are not made lightly.Mr Viner said there is a clear and compassionate framework to guide practice which includes three sets of circumstances when withdrawing life-sustaining treatment may be considered.\u0026nbspThese are if treatment is unable or unlikely to result in the child living much longer where treatment may prolong life but will cause the child unacceptable pain and suffering and if an older child with a life limiting illness repeatedly makes it clear they do not want treatment and this decision is supported by their parents and doctors.\u0026nbspAs healthcare professionals involved in the care of babies, children and young people, the priority has to be the child.Every action and decisions is taken in the best interests of the child, and decisions on care, including the withdrawal of treatment, are always made with the involvement of parents.Alfie Evans supporters have been demonstrating outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s HospitalWe cannot comment on the specifics of the case - only the medical team treating Alfie, and the legal team, will know the exact details and they are bound by patient confidentiality.However, we feel it is important for the public to know that decisions to withhold or withdraw treatment from a child are not made lightly.Decisions on whether to withdraw treatment from a child are unfortunately ones that need to be made frequently. The model is always for doctors to work closely with parents to agree on the best course of action for the child.In the vast majority of cases an equal decision is made to withdraw treatment and it is rare that there is disagreement. The cases where this is a significant difference in view are the ones that grab the media headlines.
