Photos of the garment would appear to confirm Lund\u0027s story, as the bustier worn by Abdul looks identical to the one created by Lund           Lund (pictured with Cindy Crawford in April) says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete          Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian (pictured together in their early teens), made the bustier eight years agoBut after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the \u002780s icon for the return of her item.\u0027I don\u0027t know how she came to have it, I\u0027m not saying she stole it or her stylist stole it or anything,\u0027 Lund said in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.\u0027I would just like to get it back – it\u0027s obviously my piece.\u0027Abdul\u0027s representative declined to comment on the bustier when approached by DailyMailTV, except to note that the publicity photo was taken two years ago.Lund\u0027s lawyer Stephanie Ovadia told DailyMailTV: \u0027I was retained to see the return of the property after she attempted to contact Paula to no avail.\u0027We are currently in the process of contacting Ms Abdul for the swift return of the property.\u0027Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian, made the bustier eight years ago and says creating it took her five days.She told DailyMailTV the piece has sentimental value because her grandmother helped her to create it.\u0027My grandmother helped me make it,\u0027 Lund said. \u0027She sat with me for a few hours and I had a deadline to get it done and she actually weaved some pieces on for me to help me. It\u0027s a very important piece to me.\u0027          The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani, Britney Spears and singer Roselyn Sanchez (pictured)           But after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the 80s icon for the return of her item          Lund (pictured with Kim Kardashian in their younger years) said: \u0027I don\u0027t know why it would be so hard for them to give it back to the rightful owner. It is important to me. I just want it back\u0027The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani and Britney Spears.Lund says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete.She says the garment disappeared from her showroom four years ago and assumed it had been taken by accident which is why she never reported the missing item to police.Lund said: \u0027I didn\u0027t report it to the police and the reason why we didn\u0027t is because I figured at the time, it would have been returned, it would have come back.\u0027To be honest, what are the police going to do with a bustier gone missing? They don\u0027t take something like that as seriously.\u0027I figured that through friends and through time, I would eventually get the bustier back. I always honestly thought I would get the bustier back.\u0027\u0027Every moment of life should be savored\u0027: Paula Abdul shares...Kaia Gerber steals the Versace show in flamboyant suit as...Share this article    Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems But despite her hopes, the garment was not seen again until the release of Abdul\u0027s publicity photos, which Lund saw for the first time over the weekend.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I felt two things – I felt elated and I felt excited I could possibly get my piece back again.\u0027But I also felt a little angry because it reminded me that somebody had obtained that piece dishonestly and that doesn\u0027t mean that Paula Abdul did, it doesn\u0027t mean that her stylist did, it means that somebody took that piece and it ended up in her hands and I just hope she does the right thing and gets it back to me.\u0027 Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems.

Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime. We are grateful for her many other contributions, respect her decision and wish Julie all the best in everything she does.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/19/507D87FC00000578-6203475-image-a-1_1537901253818.jpg","title":"Asia Argento speaks against Jimmy Bennett Rose McGowan","story":"    Speaking out: Asia Argento has hit back at her accuser Jimmy Bennett and her once close friend Rose McGowan in a searing interview with DailyMailTV           In the first part of her DailyMailTV interview, the actress spoke of her agony at Anthony Bourdain\u0027s death and told of her ordeal of being accused of driving him to suicide by cheating          MeToo sisters: Asia Argento and Rose McGowan shared an intense bond after both accusing Harvey Weinstein of rape and being at the forefront of speaking out about sexual harassment and violence      EXCLUSIVE: \u0027People say I murdered Anthony Bourdain.

Anthony Bourdain\u0027s grief-stricken partner accuses Dove of trying to smear Bourdain as dying with a prostitute and overdosing on heroin. In fact he hanged himself alone          Her side: Asia Argento said that although Bennett (pictured as a young boy in 2004) assaulted her, she \u0027felt sorry for the child I had met, that I cared so much about,\u0027 because he \u0027needed money\u0027          Argento\u0027s first contact with McGowan was a pivotal moment in her life. She explained, \u0027She was the first person, another Weinstein victim, I was talking to\u0027The women\u0027s friendship was forged through their shared trauma and their united goal to use it to bring about a cultural change.To Argento, McGowan was \u0027a sister.\u0027 They even got matching tattoos -a simple dot on Argento\u0027s ankle that is a marked contrast to the intricate ink of Argento\u0027s many other tattoos. (She now plans to have it erased).And when the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered.She recalled, \u0027Rose said she was in Europe that she would come and see me.\u0027What I didn\u0027t know is that she... told, this notion that she was coming to \u0027\u0027my rescue\u0027\u0027 in an interview.\u0027Today, she said, she views McGowan\u0027s actions as nothing but a \u0027publicity stunt.\u0027                             I thought, \u0027My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me.\u0027 I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me                        She said, \u0027I was completely numb, paralyzed, obviously I wasn\u0027t reading. I didn\u0027t even want to read the details of Anthony\u0027s death. I was frightened to know.\u0027I found out later that she had given this information to the news so already it was like a publicity stunt but I didn\u0027t see it.\u0027I thought, My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me. I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me.\u0027The day after Bourdain died Argento went back to work on Italian X-Factor on which she was a judge. She had a choice, she said, - work or never get up again. Today she credits that work with saving her life.She has been forced to step down from the role in the wake of the Bennett allegations.Looking back to the days directly after Bourdain\u0027s death, Argento reflected, \u0027At this time I was so lost in my mind.\u0027According to Argento it was a bizarre interlude during which she traveled to Berlin to meet Rose and her partner Dove, whom she had met for the first time the day before.Dove identifies as gender non-binary and uses the pronoun they Argento calls Dove \u0027she\u0027.          When the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered      Messages: These are texts Rain Dove sent Asia Argento in which the non-binary model told her they had obtained toxicology and medical examination results and identified a prostitute Anthony Bourdain was with who had come from Russia. All those claims were untrue.  She believed it: Texts shared by Asia Argento show how she (in blue) had come to be convinced that her lover died with a prostitute while on drugs. She now knows that to be untrue  More claims: The texts show that Rain Dove told her they knew where the \u0027syringe\u0027 used by Bourdain was and that they had obtained post-mortem documents      Shared: Asia Argento\u0027s sent these texts to Rain Dove in the form of screengrabs in which she and the CNN host discussed how to deal with Jimmy BennettSitting talking today Argento recognizes how crazy this all sounds.But then, she said, \u0027I am believing her because I am so fragile and I am looking for answers and she is giving me them, something to hold on to, a reason that he did it.\u0027DailyMailTV has spoken with another witness who was present in Berlin who backs up Argento\u0027s account about what Dove said and did. Text messages from Dove to Argento also back her story and show that McGowan was aware in July of Dove\u0027s actions, but telling Argento that she was not part of it.Argento said: \u0027I am a woman completely destroyed at this point. I don\u0027t know what day it is. I thought maybe this was Rose\u0027s Army that she spoke about. I thought maybe it exists.\u0027And when the Bennett allegations surfaced she turned to that army of women - which she called \u0027the network\u0027 for help.                             I was frozen and he was on top of me and after the act it felt weird.                        She said\u0027 \u0027I asked Rain if the network could help me some way.\u0027In response, Argento said, Dove started to tease out details of what had happened between her and Bennett - an event she is reluctant to label rape but she is certain she was the victim.She shared texts which show her disclosing the details of her and Bourdain\u0027s dealings with Bennett to Dove.She said: \u0027I said in the messages I was frozen and he was on top of me and after the act it felt weird.\u0027A picture of Argento in bed with Bennett proved particularly damaging to her claims of innocence but she maintained she was \u0027in shock\u0027 when it all took place.Argento  says the texts, first published by TMZ, were sold. Texts show Rain Dove denying that they had sold the texts.McGowan, through lawyers, vigorously denies to DailyMailTV that she was involved in obtaining or making money from the texts.Dove has maintained that they were not behind the leak of texts in which Argento told her that her interaction with Bennett had turned sexual but that HE was the aggressor.That leak came hot on the heels of a public statement issued on Argento\u0027s behalf denying everything.For Argento, she feels she is the victim again, this time of betrayal.She said: \u0027I am a single mother, I don\u0027t have work, I can\u0027t support both my children financially.\u0027But as she cops with the \u0027hole\u0027 opened up by Bourdain\u0027s death, she told DailyMailTV that there is hope.\u0027I am wounded,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I will recover.\u0027Daily Mail TV | Episodes, Showtimes, Video and more | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/19/19/5069B20200000578-0-image-m-67_1537383218809.jpg","title":"Justin Bieber new fianc Hailey Baldwin watch couples wedding","story":"     Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin overlook the wedding at the Belmond Caruso Hotel in Italy          Rebecca Reed-Sperrin and Stefan Johansen tied the knot at the exclusive hotel in RavelloThe couple, who arrived in Italy after announcing their engagement, watched on as Mr Johansen, 31, and Miss Reed-Sperrin, 32, became husband and wife.Hailey Baldwin calls engagement to Justin Bieber the...Hailey Baldwin posts and DELETES an intimate picture...Share this articleMiss Reed-Sperrin, who got engaged to her man at the hotel 18 months ago, said: \u0027It was surreal.

The process happens at this time of year and can depend upon many factors including the animals age and the latitude at which they live.Deer antlers are used primarily  to battle other male deer for mating rights. Male deer grow their first set of antlers when they hit puberty, at approximately one year of age.When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027.          Gary Kramer, 70, captured a barren ground caribou shedding its velvet at Denali National Park, Alaska          When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027. Although there is a lot of blood, the process doesn\u0027t cause the deer any discomfortBy late summer, when testosterone levels are at their peak, the blood vessels shut down around the base of the antlers and they harden into bone.Although there the antlers shed bloody red velvet, the deer do not feel any discomfort from the outgrowth.Velvet peeling typically takes a day or two to complete and those lucky enough to witness this process will often see the deer rubbing their antlers against tree branches.  Hunt for killer tigress: India\u0027s most-celebrated hunter is...These funny photos are guaranteed to make you smile!

This week the father of four was pictured, somewhat bafflingly, with what appeared to be a full head of hair — not to mention a line free-forehead, dazzling white teeth and cheeks full enough to make a twenty- something envious.So how is Beckham holding back the years? And what has he done to his barnet?HAS HE HAD A TRANSPLANT?Beckham\u0027s camp have refused to comment on whether he\u0027s had a transplant — a surgical procedure in which hair is extracted from an area of the scalp with dense growth and re-implanted into thinning areas under local anaesthetic.Beckham himself once suggested he wouldn\u0027t be tempted. \u0027There is definitely nothing wrong with doing that,\u0027 he said in 2012, \u0027but I don\u0027t think personally I would. If I do start showing signs of going bald, then I will shave it off.\u0027Hair transplant surgeon Dr Bessam Farjo, meanwhile, says there is no way the star could have had a transplant that resulted in a head of new hair in the space of a few weeks. \u0027Transplanted hair takes about three months just to break through the skin,\u0027 says Dr Farjo. He adds, however, that this doesn\u0027t mean Beckham hasn\u0027t had a transplant at some earlier stage.\u0027It\u0027s possible he might have had a transplant many months ago and been extremely clever, clipping his hair short to ert attention from it.\u0027David Beckham admits driving his £200,000 Bentley at 59mph...Tax avoiders who dodged the roll call of dishonour:...Share this articleA transplant on the front of the head extending to the crown would take around ten hours and cost around £10,000. As Dr Farjo says: \u0027A lot more men than you think have had a hair transplant, including top names who want to keep it discreet.\u0027PUMP UP THE VOLUMEEven if he has had a transplant, says Dr Farjo, there is \u0027definitely some sort of cosmetic trickery\u0027 at play to make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker.\u0027It\u0027s possible he\u0027s using a camouflage product, like a hair fibre spray, to give the illusion of thicker hair,\u0027 he says. \u0027It\u0027s a bit like putting on make-up.\u0027Fibre sprays work in two ways. \u0027They reduce the contrast in colour between the hair and skin so you don\u0027t see the scalp so easily, and they coat the hairs with a powdery material to make the hair appear thicker,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.\u0027It is quite common for make-up artists to use them on men in the media to make their hair look better under cameras. It lasts until you wash it out.\u0027And whether, in Beckham\u0027s case, the end result is ageing Adonis or nondescript middle-office-manager is a matter of opinion. \u0027It looks good — but maybe a bit over the top,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.A MANE TO DYE FORRegardless of how he got the volume back, there is no denying his hair has changed colour, with Becks\u0027s reinvention as a brunette a marked move away from the blond locks of his past. But while many might think he\u0027s well shot of the highlights, the jury\u0027s out on this new shade.Mark Woolley, creative director at Electric hairdressing group, says his new look does make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker. \u0027It looks like he\u0027s had it coloured half a shade darker. Blond hair absorbs light whereas dark hair reflects light which increases the density.\u0027He adds, however, that this \u0027can look severe\u0027 especially given the grey in his beard, and says Beckham would be better off going grey.FRESH-FACED IN HIS FORTIESBecks\u0027s face is largely wrinkle free – unusual for a man in his mid-40s. His cheeks are impressively full, and his smile lines less pronounced than in recent years.Of course, this could be down to a diligent skin care routine. \u0027One thing I do love is a face mask,\u0027 he said recently.Cynics might scoff, but cosmetic doctor Dr Mervyn Patterson insists good skincare can indeed make the skin more youthful.\u0027It is entirely possible his youthful looks could be the result of a good skin care regime and non-invasive treatments,\u0027 he says.\u0027Micro dermabrasian, for example, removes the dead skin cells to make the skin look smoother while peels — acids applied to the skin — may rejuvenate the skin and stimulate it into increasing collagen, the support structure underneath.\u0027SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUTAs a member of Manchester United\u0027s youth team David\u0027s teeth were slightly yellow, with the odd one as curved as his legendary free kicks at goal. Now they are straight, devoid of gaps and whiter than an England football kit.According to Dr Mervyn Druian of The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, he is likely to have had both braces and veneers.\u0027I\u0027m assuming that David would have had a lingual brace, which is placed at the back of your teeth and invisible. Veneers, in which very fine porcelain is bonded over the natural teeth, are likely to have changed their colour and lengths. His orthodontic treatment could have taken anything from four months to a year.\u0027He adds: \u0027I\u0027m sure the orthodontics were done some time ago, with other enhancements done more recently. The cost would have been around £8,000 to £10,000 and it is a very good result indeed.\u0027A FURROW-FREE FOREHEADHe could just lead a worry-free life, but Beckham\u0027s forehead is incredibly smooth for a man of his age. This could be attributed to a skilled application of Botox, although Beckham did specifically say he didn\u0027t \u0027agree\u0027 with the procedure last year.Dr Patterson doesn\u0027t think Beckham has had Botox, but says it \u0027is very much on the rise among men, with lots of partners encouraging them to have it done\u0027.Mr Azhar Aslam, lead surgeon at Linia Cosmetic Surgery, says: \u0027There seems to be less indention in some of the lines in his forehead and his frown line which would suggest that he has had some Botox in this area.\u0027However, it is probably only a small amount as he does not have the frozen look.\u0027 He adds: \u0027David has a great expressive face and I doubt he has had Botox around the eye area.\u0027As a surgeon I would also recommend not having Botox in this area as David has a great smile, which comes through in his eyes.\u0027So what else can Becks do to halt his hair loss...TRANSFORMATION OF THE TOUPEEHair pieces have come a long way in recent years, with celebrities from Charlie Sheen to John Travolta reported to have worn them.\u0027With a hair piece you can have any look you want,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.          Beckham, pictured in his wonky-toothed heyday, has sported many hairstyles over the yearsHair4all, a company offering \u0027non-surgical hair replacement systems\u0027 from around £550, says demand has never been higher thanks to men wanting to look like their favourite reality television stars. After an initial consultation their hair pieces are designed over a 12-14 week period, stay attached to the head for up to a month.THE VAMPIRE OPTIONFor men with thinning hair and bulging wallets, there is a version of the \u0027vampire facial\u0027 in which the patient\u0027s own blood is injected back into their scalps.In a \u0027platelet rich plasma treatment\u0027 (PRP) blood is said to stimulate the hair follicle, prolonging its growth phase. The blood is collected and separated so that the platelets — which contain protein and stimulants — can be injected back into the scalp.The treatment takes 90 minutes under local anaesthetic. One treatment every four to six months for the first year is recommended and one treatment a year for maintenance thereafter.

It is used for male pattern baldness, in which the body becomes over-sensitive to male hormones called androgens, which can block hair growth.One survey found 70.6 per cent of 352 patients reported an improvement in hair growth after 16 weeks. The topical lotion can be bought over the counter (Boots sells a three-month supply for £69.99).It was originally developed as a drug to lower blood pressure, with its hair loss remedies only discovered when people taking it realised they were growing hair where they had lost it.FISH PILLS AND CAFFEINE SHAMPOOOne of the biggest hair loss \u0027cures\u0027 currently on the market are supplements such as Nourkrin and Viviscal which contain protein extracts from fish that are believed to regenerate hair follicles.But they come at a cost and require commitment — tablets need to be taken twice a day for six months for best results, and cost around £50 for a month\u0027s supply.Proponents of caffeine shampoo claim it stops the hair roots being weakened by androgens, and in doing so encourages hair growth.But there is still limited research to suggest it does work and this March the Advertising Standards Authority told the makers of Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo that they must no longer advertise that the product can reduce hair loss. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/24/18/509DC41D00000578-0-image-m-40_1537811431738.jpg","title":"Instagram founder super p ed Mark Zuckerberg leaving","story":"Share this articleInstagram co-founders\u0027 falling out with Zuckerberg led to departures, sources sayKevin Systrom on Instagram: “@mikeyk and I are grateful for the last eight years at Instagram and six years with the Facebook team.

The equinox is when the earth\u0027s equator is almost directly in line with the sun. Pictured: The moon in London           Craig O\u0027Toole shared this incredible photograph of the Harvest Moon in Dublin          Jane Brook captured pictures of the moon at sunrise over Huddersfield, Yorkshire today           Old English Sheepdog Harry Shepherd, who has his own Twitter account, posed for this picture against the backdrop of the moonThe Harvest Moon rising over Portsmouth Cathedral in Hampshire last nightThe moon has been used by civilisations all over the world to keep track of time and, according to lunar tradition, each month\u0027s full moon receives its own name. The names will vary by location and differing folklore, however many are based on the moon\u0027s seasonal characteristics.The Harvest Moon is the closest full moon to the fall equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and usually takes place around September 22. Although it has been some time since we last saw an October Harvest Moon, it is not that rare an anomaly. \u0027The previous one was in 2009, but the one before that was 2006, and the next one will be in 2020, Earnie Wright, a specialist at the NASA Goddard Space Flighty Center\u0027s Scientific Visualization Studio in Maryland told National Geographic. Based on the equinox\u0027s timing and the regular 29.5-day cycle of the moon, a harvest moon can happen on any date between September 8 (as in 2014) and October 7 (as in 1987). It means the likelihood of an October harvest moon is roughly one in four, according to Mr Wright.           It usually appears in September and was traditionally a symbol that told farmers when to harvest their crops. It is seen rising over Portsmouth Cathedral Why is it called a Harvest Moon? Throughout the year, the moon appears over the horizon about 50 minutes later each days, on average.  But for several days around the fall equinox, the moon rises only about 30 minutes later in the US, an just 10 to 20 minutes later throughout Canada and Europe. While it might sound like not much of a difference, but the shift brings noticeably bright nights. The full moon will rise almost immediately after the sun has set, first appearing as a huge, orange-coloured orb around dusk.And with shorter periods between sunset and moonrise, farmers are able to work harvesting the crops later on into the night, hence this particular moon\u0027s name. The harvest moon is a full moon, but not one that really provides any specific unique-viewing opportunity—other than that you might have great observing from a pumpkin patch,\u0027 Andrea Jones, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter public engagement lead at NASA said.                                   Some hospitals put more staff on at full moon and ban doctors from taking days offAn investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that, in hospitals across the U.S., medical staff are convinced that full moons are ‘harbingers of chaos in their emergency rooms and delivery wards’.Doctors and nurses said full moon nights prompted a surge in patient admissions, particularly involving psychotic episodes, as well as strange injuries and women going into labour under unusual circumstances.A hospital nurse in San Antonio, Texas, recalled a full moon night when so many high school students were rushed in — all suffering from food poisoning — that the hospital ran out of beds to put them in.Some hospitals put more staff on at full moon and ban doctors from taking days off.John Becher, an A\u0026ampE doctor in New Jersey and Philadelphia for 40 years, became so convinced by the phenomenon that he didn’t want to work on full moon nights.Many medical staff had their own theories for why the full moon affects us. Michelle Schusky, a veteran radiologist, put it down to the composition of the human body. ‘Our bodies are 70 per cent water and, because the moon moves the oceans, it moves the water in your body — people flip out,’ she said.Skeptics have suggested they are victims of so-called ‘confirmation bias’ — they notice it happens to be a full moon on a night when odd things happen, but ignore the full moon nights that are deadly dull.For all that, the Sun’s effect on humans and animals is enormous, giving us the 24-hour circadian rhythm, a cycle that dominates so many creatures’ existence — everything from appetite and mood to sleep quality. That is well accepted in conventional science. Is it really so irrational to assume that the Moon influences us, too?                                                     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/13/509B45BA00000578-0-image-a-34_1537879502878.jpg","title":"Rare pinup photos o Marilyn Monroe set auction","story":"    Photographer Richard C.

Among the many images that Miller made of her, this photograph depicts Norma Jeane wearing the wedding dress from her marriage to Dougherty           Miller was one of the first photographers to work with Norma Jeane during this early period in her blossoming modeling career with the Blue Book Modeling Agency           \u0027I had no idea when I was taking these pictures that she would become famous and that the pictures would become valuable,\u0027 Miller would later say. \u0027She was just a nice, sweet attractive girl with outrageous ambitions\u0027          Miller took a rarely-seen series of portraits of brunette starlet Norma Jean in 1946 when she was an up and coming Armed Forces pinup          Miller\u0027s prints will go under the hammer October 7  along with the original photographic model release form Norma Jean Dougherty signed on March 26, 1946          \u0027He used Norma Jeane at four or five locations over several days,\u0027 the late photographer\u0027s daughter, Peg Miller, told DailyMail.com          \u0027I can\u0027t remember anything because I was a baby at the time.

But Jan, my older sister, remembered that we gave her a nickname, Nonny.\u0027It was just one of those things children make up. When Dick saw her years later he didn\u0027t know what to call her, Norma Jean, Nonny or Marilyn.\u0027I remember being told the story of how she was sat at the dinner table telling everyone that she wanted to become a star.\u0027Our parents thought, yeah right, sure - you and 20,000 other hopefuls. But sure enough she made it happen.\u0027Norma Jeane was raised an orphan in Los Angeles, enduring an abusive, unhappy childhood before she married James \u0027Jim\u0027 Dougherty at 16 to escape a series of foster homes.After dropping out of high school, the teenager turned bored housewife until Dougherty went to sea with the Merchant Marines and she took a job at a defense plant.There, Norma Jeane caught the eye of propaganda photographers who visited the factory to take morale-boosting pictures of beautiful female workers.She quit her job and in 1945 joined the Blue Book Model Agency who would book her for advertisements and magazines such U.S. Camera, Laff and Pageant, a rival to Reader\u0027s Digest.Miller was one of the first photographers to work with Norma Jeane, his memorable image of her wearing her wedding dress and clutching his wife\u0027s prayer book appearing on the June 1947 cover of Personal Romances magazine.Months later Norma Jeane signed for 20th Century Fox where executive Ben Lyon urged her to combine the name Marilyn with her grandmother\u0027s name, Monroe.

She had the charismatic quality that good models have,\u0027 added Peg, 73, a retired professor of English and higher education policy.\u0027But he didn\u0027t like her on the set of Some Like it Hot. By that time she was really challenged. She had trouble getting to the set on time. She had trouble getting her lines out.\u0027He remembered the moment Tony Curtis famously finished a kissing scene then stood up and said kissing Marilyn was just like kissing Hitler.\u0027Monroe\u0027s troubled private life received almost as much attention as her bombshell looks as she struggled with substance abuse and depression.Her second and third marriages to baseball star Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller both ended in orce.Monroe died from an overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home on August 5, 1962. She was only 36.Although the icon\u0027s death was ruled a probable suicide her demise has been subject to countless conspiracy theories.Many of those who worked alongside her, including Miller, harbored doubts.\u0027Fame was too much for her, it really was,\u0027 added Peg. \u0027My father was very skeptical of the idea her death was suicide.Bill Cosby is escorted out of court in handcuffsTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleTrump thanks Kim Jong-Un for improved relations during UN speechMeghan Markle arrives at the Royal Academy of Arts for \u0027Oceania\u0027Kavanaugh to Martha McCallum: \u0027I\u0027ve never sexually assaulted anyone\u0027McConnell says Kavanaugh will get a vote on the Senate floorHeartrending moment mom dog bids pup farewell after it was adoptedMartha MacCallum exclusive interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wifeUnique \u0027tidal\u0027 art gallery at Males resort is destroyed by policeParascending pair injured after flying into electricity cablesBeluga whale spotted in the THAMES off Coalhouse FortMarilyn Monroe\u0027s wedding car goes on sale for $500k:...The glitz and glamour of a bygone era: LA\u0027s \u0027belle epoque\u0027...Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Share this article    The portfolio going to auction next week comprises 12 archival pigment prints capturing the youthful Monroe modelling by the pool, splashing around in the sea, fishing, carrying a cute puppy and playfully hopping a fence.           Miller, here in a self portrait with Marilyn, died in 2010 at the age of 98.

The process happens at this time of year and can depend upon many factors including the animals age and the latitude at which they live.Deer antlers are used primarily  to battle other male deer for mating rights. Male deer grow their first set of antlers when they hit puberty, at approximately one year of age.When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027.          Gary Kramer, 70, captured a barren ground caribou shedding its velvet at Denali National Park, Alaska          When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027. Although there is a lot of blood, the process doesn\u0027t cause the deer any discomfortBy late summer, when testosterone levels are at their peak, the blood vessels shut down around the base of the antlers and they harden into bone.Although there the antlers shed bloody red velvet, the deer do not feel any discomfort from the outgrowth.Velvet peeling typically takes a day or two to complete and those lucky enough to witness this process will often see the deer rubbing their antlers against tree branches.  Hunt for killer tigress: India\u0027s most-celebrated hunter is...These funny photos are guaranteed to make you smile!

There is no partner in Samantha\u0027s life. She conceived via a sperm donor after deciding to go it alone at age 38 as her biological clock ticked ever faster.Instead, Grace and Rory will move from their three-bedroom home in Lincoln to London, where they will be raised by Samantha\u0027s cousin, a married mother-of-two.Pragmatic by nature, Samantha has spent the fortnight since receiving her devastating prognosis preparing for their lives without her.She is hurriedly planning memory boxes of treasured possessions, gifts for future birthdays and teddy bears sewn from their mummy\u0027s clothes. She hopes, too, that these pictures taken by the Mail will be lasting mementos to remember her by.          Samantha with her non identical twins Grace and Rory who were born three years apart\u0027They are the last photographs we will have taken together,\u0027 says Samantha, whose healthy-looking exterior belies the fact her body is failing. Exhausted, she struggles to eat, suffers from nausea and is no longer strong enough to pick Grace up.When she deteriorates further she will go to a hospice: she doesn\u0027t want her children to see her suffer.\u0027I don\u0027t want them to remember me looking ill, and I cannot imagine what it would be like for them to watch me die,\u0027 she says. \u0027I want them to have only happy memories of me, which is why our \u0027golden hours\u0027 are so important.\u0027Samantha\u0027s desire to become a mother was consolidated by both family tragedy and the realities of her job.The daughter of an RAF nurse and an engineer, she joined the Forces aged 18 as a linguist, working her way up to Intelligence Officer, analysing defence intelligence from coutries such as Iraq and Kuwait and often serving in warzones.\u0027People I know died in service,\u0027 she says.Her growing desire to put down roots of her own was compounded when her mother died in 2000, aged 49, from a perforated stomach ulcer and her father in 2005 from cirrhosis of the liver. Her sister took her own life the following year.\u0027When you lose people, you realise what\u0027s valuable,\u0027 says Samantha. \u0027I am a caring person and wanted someone to nurture, to bring up the best I could.\u0027Going it alone wasn\u0027t Samantha\u0027s first choice, yet her hopes of finding someone to start a family with were to be dashed. From her late 20s, she\u0027d dated a colleague until he finally admitted that having had children in a previous relationship, he didn\u0027t want more.One person quits smoking every 80 seconds in England as...Lying about dead dogs, posing as cancer doctors and faking...Philip Hammond \u0027plans to hammer the pensions of thousands of...Share this article    Samantha, who has served 20 years in the forces,  smiling and happy with Grace after Rory\u0027s birth          Samantha  became a mum aged 40, when her daughter Grace was born, after she spent £10,000 on IVF treatment. Here she is on beach with her family          After three failed attempts at IUI, where sperm is placed directly into the uterus, Samantha embarked on IVFBy then aged 38, Samantha had served 20 years in the Forces and was entitled to a £12,000-a-year pension, enabling her to leave and concentrate on making a family life for herself. But still she failed to find someone to settle down with.As dating proved unsuccessful, Samantha considered adoption — but was put off by the fact that if she met a partner after embarking on the process as a single woman, she would have to begin again.So via the privately-owned European Sperm Bank, she paid £2,000 for sperm from a Danish donor called Lance, who was a 35-year-old medical student.\u0027My research showed children who have been conceived through a donor usually want to know their roots, and the Bank provided his photograph and a recording of his voice which I have kept for the children,\u0027 says Samantha.\u0027I didn\u0027t worry about having babies without a dad. It is better they had no father than a bad father, and with friends and relatives\u0027 support I could give them all the love they needed.\u0027          For the past year Samantha has been home schooling Grace so she didn\u0027t have to be apart from her daughterAfter three failed attempts at IUI, where sperm is placed directly into the uterus, Samantha embarked on IVF. Seven of her eggs were fertilised, with two embryos implanted and the remaining five frozen should she decide to have more children.Aged 40, she fell pregnant on her first IVF attempt in March 2012.\u0027I was overjoyed — it took several pregnancy tests to sink in,\u0027 says Samantha. Grace was born in December 2012.It was when her daughter was three that Samantha decided to try for another child.\u0027I didn\u0027t want Grace to grow up without a sibling and decided to give IVF another go,\u0027 she says.Three of her stored embryos were still viable. To her delight, one resulted in pregnancy and Rory was born in August 2016.\u0027I felt doubly blessed,\u0027 Samantha says. \u0027Having been conceived at the same time, they are twins, even though they were born years apart. They are incredibly close, though very different.\u0027          Spending £12,000 on IVF,  Samantha, pictured with Rory, gave birth to twins made from the same embryoInstead of a funeral, which Samantha believes would be too upsetting for Grace and Rory, she is having a \u0027living wake\u0027 this week at a local pub. The dress code is pink, and Samantha\u0027s pink kaftan and wig are already laid out in preparation.\u0027I want people to celebrate my life while I\u0027m here,\u0027 she says.She is donating her body to the University of Nottingham School of Health Sciences for medical training, after which, she says, \u0027they can stick any ashes left into a firework and fire it into the air. My children don\u0027t need a graveyard to remember me by.\u0027Instead, Grace is planning a fairy garden in honour of her mummy, for which she has already painted fairies and a pink ballerina stone.\u0027I\u0027m not religious but I am spiritual and I\u0027m not scared of dying,\u0027 says Samantha. \u0027I\u0027ve told Grace I\u0027ll always be around — that whenever she\u0027s thinking about me, I\u0027ll be thinking about her.\u0027In the letters she is in the process of writing to her children, she will tell them not to be afraid to follow their dreams. \u0027Don\u0027t put off what you want to do. Pay compliments, speak to strangers. Be kind.\u0027How would she like Grace and Rory to think of their mother, as they grow up without her?

This week the father of four was pictured, somewhat bafflingly, with what appeared to be a full head of hair — not to mention a line free-forehead, dazzling white teeth and cheeks full enough to make a twenty- something envious.So how is Beckham holding back the years? And what has he done to his barnet?HAS HE HAD A TRANSPLANT?Beckham\u0027s camp have refused to comment on whether he\u0027s had a transplant — a surgical procedure in which hair is extracted from an area of the scalp with dense growth and re-implanted into thinning areas under local anaesthetic.Beckham himself once suggested he wouldn\u0027t be tempted. \u0027There is definitely nothing wrong with doing that,\u0027 he said in 2012, \u0027but I don\u0027t think personally I would. If I do start showing signs of going bald, then I will shave it off.\u0027Hair transplant surgeon Dr Bessam Farjo, meanwhile, says there is no way the star could have had a transplant that resulted in a head of new hair in the space of a few weeks. \u0027Transplanted hair takes about three months just to break through the skin,\u0027 says Dr Farjo. He adds, however, that this doesn\u0027t mean Beckham hasn\u0027t had a transplant at some earlier stage.\u0027It\u0027s possible he might have had a transplant many months ago and been extremely clever, clipping his hair short to ert attention from it.\u0027David Beckham admits driving his £200,000 Bentley at 59mph...Tax avoiders who dodged the roll call of dishonour:...Share this articleA transplant on the front of the head extending to the crown would take around ten hours and cost around £10,000. As Dr Farjo says: \u0027A lot more men than you think have had a hair transplant, including top names who want to keep it discreet.\u0027PUMP UP THE VOLUMEEven if he has had a transplant, says Dr Farjo, there is \u0027definitely some sort of cosmetic trickery\u0027 at play to make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker.\u0027It\u0027s possible he\u0027s using a camouflage product, like a hair fibre spray, to give the illusion of thicker hair,\u0027 he says. \u0027It\u0027s a bit like putting on make-up.\u0027Fibre sprays work in two ways. \u0027They reduce the contrast in colour between the hair and skin so you don\u0027t see the scalp so easily, and they coat the hairs with a powdery material to make the hair appear thicker,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.\u0027It is quite common for make-up artists to use them on men in the media to make their hair look better under cameras. It lasts until you wash it out.\u0027And whether, in Beckham\u0027s case, the end result is ageing Adonis or nondescript middle-office-manager is a matter of opinion. \u0027It looks good — but maybe a bit over the top,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.A MANE TO DYE FORRegardless of how he got the volume back, there is no denying his hair has changed colour, with Becks\u0027s reinvention as a brunette a marked move away from the blond locks of his past. But while many might think he\u0027s well shot of the highlights, the jury\u0027s out on this new shade.Mark Woolley, creative director at Electric hairdressing group, says his new look does make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker. \u0027It looks like he\u0027s had it coloured half a shade darker. Blond hair absorbs light whereas dark hair reflects light which increases the density.\u0027He adds, however, that this \u0027can look severe\u0027 especially given the grey in his beard, and says Beckham would be better off going grey.FRESH-FACED IN HIS FORTIESBecks\u0027s face is largely wrinkle free – unusual for a man in his mid-40s. His cheeks are impressively full, and his smile lines less pronounced than in recent years.Of course, this could be down to a diligent skin care routine. \u0027One thing I do love is a face mask,\u0027 he said recently.Cynics might scoff, but cosmetic doctor Dr Mervyn Patterson insists good skincare can indeed make the skin more youthful.\u0027It is entirely possible his youthful looks could be the result of a good skin care regime and non-invasive treatments,\u0027 he says.\u0027Micro dermabrasian, for example, removes the dead skin cells to make the skin look smoother while peels — acids applied to the skin — may rejuvenate the skin and stimulate it into increasing collagen, the support structure underneath.\u0027SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUTAs a member of Manchester United\u0027s youth team David\u0027s teeth were slightly yellow, with the odd one as curved as his legendary free kicks at goal. Now they are straight, devoid of gaps and whiter than an England football kit.According to Dr Mervyn Druian of The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, he is likely to have had both braces and veneers.\u0027I\u0027m assuming that David would have had a lingual brace, which is placed at the back of your teeth and invisible. Veneers, in which very fine porcelain is bonded over the natural teeth, are likely to have changed their colour and lengths. His orthodontic treatment could have taken anything from four months to a year.\u0027He adds: \u0027I\u0027m sure the orthodontics were done some time ago, with other enhancements done more recently. The cost would have been around £8,000 to £10,000 and it is a very good result indeed.\u0027A FURROW-FREE FOREHEADHe could just lead a worry-free life, but Beckham\u0027s forehead is incredibly smooth for a man of his age. This could be attributed to a skilled application of Botox, although Beckham did specifically say he didn\u0027t \u0027agree\u0027 with the procedure last year.Dr Patterson doesn\u0027t think Beckham has had Botox, but says it \u0027is very much on the rise among men, with lots of partners encouraging them to have it done\u0027.Mr Azhar Aslam, lead surgeon at Linia Cosmetic Surgery, says: \u0027There seems to be less indention in some of the lines in his forehead and his frown line which would suggest that he has had some Botox in this area.\u0027However, it is probably only a small amount as he does not have the frozen look.\u0027 He adds: \u0027David has a great expressive face and I doubt he has had Botox around the eye area.\u0027As a surgeon I would also recommend not having Botox in this area as David has a great smile, which comes through in his eyes.\u0027So what else can Becks do to halt his hair loss...TRANSFORMATION OF THE TOUPEEHair pieces have come a long way in recent years, with celebrities from Charlie Sheen to John Travolta reported to have worn them.\u0027With a hair piece you can have any look you want,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.          Beckham, pictured in his wonky-toothed heyday, has sported many hairstyles over the yearsHair4all, a company offering \u0027non-surgical hair replacement systems\u0027 from around £550, says demand has never been higher thanks to men wanting to look like their favourite reality television stars. After an initial consultation their hair pieces are designed over a 12-14 week period, stay attached to the head for up to a month.THE VAMPIRE OPTIONFor men with thinning hair and bulging wallets, there is a version of the \u0027vampire facial\u0027 in which the patient\u0027s own blood is injected back into their scalps.In a \u0027platelet rich plasma treatment\u0027 (PRP) blood is said to stimulate the hair follicle, prolonging its growth phase. The blood is collected and separated so that the platelets — which contain protein and stimulants — can be injected back into the scalp.The treatment takes 90 minutes under local anaesthetic. One treatment every four to six months for the first year is recommended and one treatment a year for maintenance thereafter. Treatments cost upwards of £1,000 and there have yet to be any major clinical trials on it.\u0027It\u0027s fashionable, and good at preparing the scalp for a hair transplant, but the jury is definitely out on how beneficial this is,\u0027 says Glenn Lyons, clinical director at The Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic in London. \u0027There is no substantial evidence it works.\u0027THE PROVEN TREATMENTOne of the only proven methods for preventing hair loss is minoxidil, sold under the brand name Regaine. It is used for male pattern baldness, in which the body becomes over-sensitive to male hormones called androgens, which can block hair growth.One survey found 70.6 per cent of 352 patients reported an improvement in hair growth after 16 weeks. The topical lotion can be bought over the counter (Boots sells a three-month supply for £69.99).It was originally developed as a drug to lower blood pressure, with its hair loss remedies only discovered when people taking it realised they were growing hair where they had lost it.FISH PILLS AND CAFFEINE SHAMPOOOne of the biggest hair loss \u0027cures\u0027 currently on the market are supplements such as Nourkrin and Viviscal which contain protein extracts from fish that are believed to regenerate hair follicles.But they come at a cost and require commitment — tablets need to be taken twice a day for six months for best results, and cost around £50 for a month\u0027s supply.Proponents of caffeine shampoo claim it stops the hair roots being weakened by androgens, and in doing so encourages hair growth.But there is still limited research to suggest it does work and this March the Advertising Standards Authority told the makers of Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo that they must no longer advertise that the product can reduce hair loss. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/15/502C266000000578-0-image-m-32_1536935844299.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyn announce green jobs revolution plans promising 400 000 new jobs","story":"    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn works on his speech at a hotel in Liverpool ahead of addressing delegates at the party\u0027s annual conference todayAnd Labour will set a target for retro-fitting insulation to four million homes – a move which could cost middle-class families thousands.

Mr Corbyn will today pledge to tackle \u0027patchy\u0027 provision and scrap means-testing - benefiting up to a million children and their parents.Under current Government rules for free childcare, 15 hours a week is offered for all three and four-year-olds, regardless of income, but under Labour\u0027s changes it will be doubled to 30 hours for three and four-year-olds with two-year-olds also included.

Dominika Piasecka, a spokeswoman for The Vegan Society, has said the advert was in bad taste but, on the plus side, could cause more people to go veganShe said: \u0027The number of vegans has quadrupled in the last four years alone and it\u0027s obvious that the meat, dairy and egg industries are becoming worried and resorting to adverts like this.\u0027The irony is that this message actually helps people to make the connection between the dead cow being sold at the butcher\u0027s shop and the sentient, living being he or she once was.\u0027We hope this advert will help people to see that eating animals is unnecessary and easily avoidable in this day and age, with a plethora of vegan options available everywhere.\u0027While some took to social media to criticise the butchers, some have defended his actions.One wrote: \u0027The board outside the butchers says something comical and funny every week. I don\u0027t see how this is alienating vegans as why would a vegan be setting foot in a butchers anyway.While another said: \u0027Brilliant.

But the Labour Party\u0027s official policy is to keep Trident\u0027Plus the assumption that all those skilled workers would be happy to walk away from the brilliant work they are doing in building out new submarines demonstrates how out of touch they really are.\u0027 His comments come after Andrew Murray, a senior aide to the Labour leader, earlier this week told a meeting at the party\u0027s annual conference in Liverpool that a Corbyn government would be an anti-war Government. And he detailed similar plans to scrap Trident and put the well-skilled employees to work in other industries.Mr Hamilton has previously stated his commitment to see Trident scrapped.   In an interview with the Trident Ploughshares anti-nuclear weapons group, he said: \u0027It (Labour) should be a party of nuclear disarmament. It isn\u0027t at the moment. That is a source of sadness to me.\u0027I need to win this argument as shadow minister for peace and disarmament. But you need to carry on putting that pressure on elected members, on party members...\u0027You need to keep up that effort and that profile you\u0027ve had making the case for Britain to sign the treaty, to get rid of its nuclear weapons.\u0027They are not a deterrent in my view, and they are certainly far too expensive, and they are certainly not independent.\u0027Let\u0027s use that money for life-enhancing expenditure on our health service, on our public transport system even on our conventional defence... but not on these terrible weapons of mass destruction that can only result in the end of life on Earth.\u0027              Labour frontbencher’s plan to scrap Trident to be considered by Shadow Cabinet - Yorkshire Post"},{"url":null,"title":"Rochester mother told stop breastfeeding easyJet flight London Gatwick Fuerteventura","story":"    Kelly Edgson-Payne, 36, was flying from London Gatwick to Fuerteventura with her husband Ross, 40, and their four children when she was told she could not breastfeed her one-year-old son Lex (pictured together) Eleven-month-old baby dies on Qatar Airways flight to IndiaShare this articleMs Edgson-Payne, who says she has never had an issue breastfeeding any of her children on flights, has slammed the budget airline for \u0027not seeming to know the law about breastfeeding\u0027.The mother-of-four, of Rochester, Kent, said: \u0027It\u0027s just absolutely crazy that I was told that I couldn\u0027t feed him - crazy, and really embarrassing for me.\u0027I find it really disappointing that an airline I trust, and who we fly with all the time, actually broke the law in discriminating against me as a breastfeeding mother.\u0027The law in the UK says it protects breastfeeding mothers - and even easyJet\u0027s own website says mothers are welcome to breastfeed at any time during a flight.          Pictured: Kelly Edgson-Payne and her one-year-old son Lex, who live in Rochester, Kent \u0027There\u0027s just no consistency in their messages. They should not be discriminating against breastfeeding.\u0027 She continued: \u0027We fly with easyJet literally all the time, and I have always breastfed all my children over the years during take-off - because their ears pop and its uncomfortable for them.\u0027Most other cabin crew would actually encourage breastfeeding during take-off, because it distracts them and stops them from crying.\u0027I\u0027ve never before been told that I can\u0027t feed Lex, or any of my other children - and we\u0027ve flown with him about 16 times in the last year.\u0027\u0027So I got settled into my seat and I started to feed my son, as I would usually.          The mother-of-four (pictured with son Lex), from Kent, claims she was \u0027mortified\u0027 and she and her youngest child were both left in tears \u0027Then a male member of cabin crew came over and told me I couldn\u0027t feed him during take-off, and that I\u0027d have to stop and strap him in to his infant seat next to me.\u0027Ms Edgson-Payne continued: \u0027It was just crazy. I said, \u0027Well, he\u0027s feeding\u0027. But I just had to stop mid-feed and hand him to my husband.\u0027I was mortified. I\u0027m not afraid to breastfeed my baby wherever - I\u0027ve stopped at a break point during a marathon before and fed him - but this left me embarrassed and in tears.\u0027I had to very quickly cover myself up - but my breasts were still leaking milk, because I had stopped mid-feed.\u0027Even my eldest daughter, who is nine, said, \u0027Mummy, they can\u0027t tell you not to breastfeed him\u0027.\u0027Ms Edgson-Payne, mother to Mia, nine, Elena, five, Jax, three, and Lex, one, said a female member of cabin crew approached her after take-off and apologised for the incident.She said: \u0027The two of them had a bit of a hoo-ha, and she then later came up to me and said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry about that, ignore him, he\u0027s wrong.\u0027          Ms Edgson-Payne (pictured with Lex) who says she has never had an issue breastfeeding any of her children on flights, has slammed the budget airline for \u0027not seeming to know the law about breastfeeding\u0027\u0027What annoys and disappoints me is that there is no consistency. On their website they state, \u0027We support breastfeeding mothers and you can feed your baby on board at any time\u0027.\u0027But when I emailed their customer services about it afterwards, I was told, Passengers are allowed to breastfeed their babies on board the aircraft, as long as you are doing this in a discreet manner.\u0027The ironic thing is, since having my third and fourth children, whenever I fly I have always booked my infant a seat next to me.\u0027So I\u0027ve never in the last six years sat next to a random passenger.\u0027Up until the cabin crew told me I couldn\u0027t breastfeed, I don\u0027t think any other passengers were even paying any attention to me at all.\u0027She added that all easyJet offered her in the way of compensation was a £25 voucher to be used on another flight with them.She said: \u0027I just want them to make themselves aware of the law so no other mums have to go through this.\u0027An easyJet spokesman said: \u0027easyJet supports breastfeeding and customers flying with easyJet can breastfeed at any time during the flight.\u0027It is not our policy to ask mothers to be discreet and we make this very clear in our training.\u0027This flight was operated by another airline on our behalf and while they should follow easyJet policies we are sorry this did not happen on this occasion.\u0027We have followed up to ensure this does not happen in future.\u0027           When she raised the issue with easyJet after she landed, she was told passengers are welcome to breastfeed babies on their flights - so long as they are \u0027discreet\u0027.

Our own Sydney Opera House exemplifies the power of architecture to touch the heart. It amplifies the delights of our city, its harbour and its landscape. Its design responds to our climate and light, as delicately reflected in the sculptural beauty of the shells.

As a result, the back-breaking work of shearing inevitably took place in sweltering temperatures, often over 40 degrees. The Deepwater Woolshed, constructed in 2005, rethought the shearing shed. Alongside optimal orientation to capture prevailing breezes, the large overhangs shade the walls and sheep access areas. A reticulated water system sprays cooling water on the roof and across mesh screen walls. A clever system of gates allows flexible and efficient movement and handling of sheep in a low-stress environment. Using simple techniques, the architects have provided the most comfortable environment for both sheep and shearers – and it still, unmistakably, continues the tradition of the great Aussie shed.”University of the Sunshine Coast Library, Sippy Downs, QueenslandNominated by Lindsay and Kerry Clare, Clare DesignArchitects Lawrence Nield in association with John Mainwaring Architects“This project entirely re-evaluates the traditional role of the library as a repository for books, to become an open ‘information exchange centre’.

What does the Cuban artist have in store for Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall? Will the mounted police have to be called out again?This is not really helping. My best guess is that the Caillebotte suggests something about shared, communal labour. I’m not sure what The Ambassadors hints at, since it’s such an enigmatic work of art.“My God, I have never done this before,” Bruguera says, gleefully, “this thing of saying nothing and saying everything. Let’s say that this work is related to portraiture.” She gives me some other clues. It will, she says, be the first work in the Turbine Hall commission’s 18-year history to be a community project. Or, more specifically, a neighbourhood project, since it will involve people who have Tate Modern’s postcode, London SE1. She likes the idea of its not being about communities but neighbours, those people you can’t choose, often don’t meet and who might range through every socioeconomic bracket.She drops a few more hints. It will involve a legacy, a shift in the way the Tate works, a new body that will outlast the project itself, called Tate Neighbours. As with all Bruguera’s creative output, it will rely on others for it to burst into existence. “It will need the audience to uncover the work, to reveal the work. It will only exist if there is a genuine collective effort to make the work happen. To make it you have to work with people you have never met. Unless you come together with 300 friends, you will have to work with whoever is next to you. It is a neighbourhood in the Tate.” And what is it all for? “It is about how we make immigrants our neighbours. That is the big question of the project.” It is, she says, her response to the rising global tide of nationalism and xenophobia.For Bruguera, who is 50, art, activism and politics are not matters to be carefully untangled and set apart. Her work is always in the service of a political idea. It is arte útil – useful art. She grew up in Cuba in a well-connected family. Her father served as a diplomat, loyal to the regime to the end of Fidel Castro’s life. She studied in Cuba and the US, and her life is largely ided between the two countries.She considers herself a revolutionary, but has become a thorn in the side of the Cuban authorities. She has been detained repeatedly, interrogated on more than 40 occasions, and denounced in newspapers as a CIA operative.The work she considers her most successful is a piece called Tatlin’s Whisper No 6. (The series of works is named after Vladimir Tatlin, the Soviet constructivist artist.) At the Havana Biennial in 2009, in the wake of Raúl Castro’s promise of a greater degree of open debate in Cuba, she set up an official-looking stage, presided over by two men in military uniform. Anyone could step up to the podium and say what they wanted for one minute. A white dove was placed on each speaker’s shoulder – a reference to the dove that landed on Fidel Castro’s shoulder in Havana in 1959 when he spoke amid the triumph of the new-minted revolution.Tatlin’s Whisper No 6 was, she says, “the art of ‘not yet’, or the art of ‘what if’”. Taking official statements on openness at face value, she created “a real moment of free speech. And it worked because it stopped the government. They didn’t know how to censor it. I don’t like to be censored. I want to make work that surpasses censorship.” The piece, she says, is her most theatrical work. “I staged reality. And this is the only thing they understand – theatre. Not performance but traditional theatre, where the script is prewritten and there are just a few stock characters.”She once had an argument about the theatre of Cuban politics with her interrogator. (She has one regular woman assigned to her.) These sessions might involve being taken to a police station or a special house frequently they happen when she is entering or leaving the country. (A leitmotif of recent interrogations has been their urging her never to come back.)“It is frightening,” she says. “You feel in those moments that the law doesn’t exist. It’s an interesting position to be in because it was the first time I have felt the law – I mean the absence of it. You assume in your life that certain protections or rights exist. When I asked for a lawyer, they said to me, ‘You have been watching too many Hollywood movies.’ I said, ‘I want to call my family.’ It never happened.” She is normally filmed during these sessions, which she finds unnerving: she fears the footage will be manipulated.Bruguera, for now, is concentrating on the Turbine Hall commission. She has already made one work in the space – not for the big annual project but as part of the museum’s regular programme. Unheralded and unpublicised, it involved two real mounted police officers using crowd control techniques on visitors. She liked it because it was simply itself, rather than a representation or a symbol. They were real police officers, doing to visitors what they did to crowds in reality. If her work sounds dry and conceptual, this is the artwork to knock aside that view: it was alsobeautiful, the horses splendid and incongruous in the museum. “I have had to forget that piece in order to do this project. I just kept thinking, ‘It has to be better than the horses!’” she says.Her favourite works in the Turbine Hall series have been “the ones that everyone loved” – Doris Salcedo and Olafur Eliasson. Salcedo had a crack jackhammered into the length of the Turbine Hall Eliasson’s Weather Project involved artificial fog and a strange, hovering sodium sun. Looking back at her predecessors in the series, she has learned that “you have to do a clear gesture instead of objects. And, no matter what you do, people will make it their own in their imaginations. You have to treat the Turbine Hall not as a gallery, but as a street. Maybe people pass by and stop. Maybe they will just pass by.”The world is catching up with Bruguera’s view. Many younger artists are rejecting the fastidious distinction between art and activism they are nailing their colours to the mast. Art, Bruguera argues, has a role to play in responding to a political situation, or to precipitating change. Sometimes a response to injustice is not primarily rational, but emotional emotion that can then be processed into language or music or art, she argues.Bruguera’s work can be dark, but there is also a chink of light. “Sometimes I deal with negative energies. That does not mean the work is pessimistic, but that it deals with things people would rather not touch. I do work with faith. I have faith. It’s just that the path is complicated.”• Tania Bruguera’s Hyundai Commission is at Tate Modern, London, from 2 October-24 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f59c3e2be6967b2dee8c49a5e40174d1f97af02c/0_148_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f4c125ee21a7c182d3bfb96381b4ae4","title":"obscenity trial judges copy of lady chatterleys lover to be sold","story":"Edition of DH Lawrence novel used by Sir Lawrence Byrne in presiding over the landmark prosecution will be auctioned in OctoberA copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover used by the judge who presided over the novel’s 1960 obscenity trial, complete with annotations from his wife noting where DH Lawrence descended to writing about “love making”, is set to be auctioned this autumn, for the first time in 25 years.The 1960 trial saw Penguin Books prosecuted for publishing the unexpurgated text of Lawrence’s novel. It was a test case for the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which ruled that a work was obscene if its effect “is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons”.In its preliminary address, the prosecution asked: “Would you approve of your young sons, young daughters – because girls can read as well as boys – reading this book? Is it a book that you would have lying around in your own house? Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?” The defence, in its turn, called 35 eminent literary figures to give their opinions on Lawrence’s treatment of sex, as well as his intentions.Presiding judge Sir Lawrence Byrne’s wife, Lady Dorothy Byrne, read the novel for her husband, noting down the passages and pages that veered into sexually explicit areas – or, as she put it, “coarse” territory, or “love making”. She is also understood to have sewn the damask bag in which the copy was kept. Sotheby’s, which will auction the book, the notes and the bag on 30 October for an estimate of £10,000-15,000, said the blue-grey bag was “no doubt to prevent the press photographers from capturing the judge carrying a copy of the book”.Byrne’s copy of Lady Chatterley’s Lover is “far from the only copy of the book to have been read with particular attention to the sex scenes, but as a document of the event, it is arguably the most important copy to have survived to this day,” said Sotheby’s, which described the trial as the most celebrated in British literary history.The copy was previously sold in December 1993 for £4,370, then the highest price ever recorded for a paperback sold at auction. The purchaser was Christopher Cone, who bought it as a present for his partner, the late Stanley J Seeger. It is now being sold as part of a sale of property from their country home.The trial jury took just three hours to return their “not guilty” verdict. Sotheby’s said that while Mr Justice Byrne’s “summing up had been fair … his private views were almost certainly glimpsed in his refusal to award costs, leaving the defendants with a substantial legal bill”.

Not strictly a colony but rather an International Settlement, a port city forced open by imperialist aggression in 1842 after the first opium war. The part of the city that was sectioned off came under foreign control, its residents subject only to the laws of their home countries. The irony is that as a result of this, Shanghai was to become a refuge during the 1920s and 30s for more than three million Chinese fleeing civil war, warlordism, disease, drought and famine. In the late 30s, it also became a port of last resort for some 30,000 Jewish refugees fleeing fascism in Germany and Austria.From its inception the International Settlement and adjacent French Concession developed a unique culture that took from both Chinese and western trends. Haipai, or Shanghai style, saw cross-cultural innovations in dress, manners and social mores, as well as in literature, cinema, entertainment and commercial design. The undoubted glamour of Shanghai’s modernist aesthetic is seductive and lends a romantic appeal to the city of this period, but it was also a city of endemic poverty for many and it endured constant political turmoil.City of Devils is the true story of two men who sought wealth and fame in Shanghai while attempting to put their past lives, in Europe and the US, behind them. The two men are representative of the aspiration and the chutzpah, as well as the avarice and amorality, of those who made Shanghai’s underworld their home. “Lucky” Jack Riley, an ex-navy boxing champion, who escaped from prison in the US, spotted a craze for gambling in China and rose to become Shanghai’s gambling kingpin. “Dapper”Joe Farren was a Jewish boy who fled Vienna’s ghetto for Shanghai and created chorus lines that rivalled Ziegfeld’s. Together they built the city’s biggest casino. The book is the story of their rise to power and their downfall how they thought they ruled Shanghai but found the city had other ideas.So here are 10 books – fiction and non-fiction – that reveal the unique cosmopolitan hybridity of Shanghai between the wars:1. Man’s Fate by André Malraux (1933) In recreating the bloody events of the suppression of the Communist party in Shanghai in 1927, Malraux wrote the best novel about interwar Shanghai. His cast of characters – both Chinese and foreign – reflect the city’s cosmopolitan population and its Jekyll and Hyde politics of being both a centre of rightwing bootstraps capitalism and the birthplace of the Chinese Communist party. 2. Lust, Caution by Eileen Chang (Zhang Ailing) (1979) Chang recalls her own traumatic and adventurous wartime years in this novella that, because it is so personal and revelatory, took her more than 35 years to write. The long Japanese occupation of the city, the relationships that formed in those desperate times, and the terrible choices the Shanghainese were forced to make are at the heart of a book that became a fantastic movie directed by Ang Lee. Chang remains the pre-eminent bard of Shanghai.3. Old Shanghai: Gangsters in Paradise by Lynn Pan (Pan Ling) (1984)Pan is a non-fiction writer living in Shanghai who was a child during the Japanese occupation. Her research and scholarship is exemplary, while her writing is both precise and lyrical. She evokes the interwar years of Shanghai wonderfully, portraying the city as a criminal free-for-all controlled by its all-powerful Chinese mobs, “Big Eared” Du’s Green Gang and “Pockmarked” Huang’s Red Gang.4. Shanghai: A Novel by Yokomitsu Riichi (1931)A marvellously evocative representation of Shanghai written contemporaneously by one of Japan’s leading experimental modernists, a member of the New Sensationalist group of writers. It reads like a hardboiled noir with fog, rain and dark, dangerous streets. Riichi spent time in Shanghai and his novel reveals the city as a melting pot of cultures, nationalities and ideas. He shows us Shanghai’s Japanese community before the second world war, the positive interactions between Chinese and Japanese intellectuals and artists, as well as the large number of often-grim Japanese-run cotton mills and silk filatures.5. No Dogs and Not Many Chinese by Frances Wood (1998) Wood, a former curator of the Chinese collection at the British Library, tells the story of Shanghai from its mid-19th-century creation as an imperial prize forced from China to its formation as an international treaty port. She describes Shanghai’s cosmopolitanism, wealth and modernity, which was often in stark contrast to the poverty of much of the Chinese and European refugee population.6. Empire of the Sun by JG Ballard (1984) Shanghai-born Ballard’s fictionalised memoir of his time in a Japanese civilian internment camp at Lunghua on the edge of the city annoyed many of his fellow camp inmates when it was published, as they didn’t come out of it very well. Ballard took the decision to fictionalise his experiences the better to show the often “casual surrealism” of war. While he reveals the ignominies and deprivations of the camp, the earlier chapters also provide a vivid description of life for a wealthy and privileged foreign family in the city before the war with Japan.7. Midnight by Mao Dun (1933) The best of the Shanghai-set novels by China’s leftwing realist writers of the 1930s – who also included Lu Xun and Ba Jin – which accentuated the harsh and often brutal capitalist face of the city and offered an intimate portrait of working-class life.8. Miss Jill by Emily Hahn (1947) The New Yorker correspondent “Mickey” Hahn lived in Shanghai shortly before the war and saw all sides of the city - she became an opium addict, was the mistress of a wealthy Shanghai poet (Shao Xunmei), got invited to all the best parties and knew everybody there was to know. Miss Jill is one of Hahn’s few novels and tells the story of an American girl roving the pre-war China coast and making her way in the city using whatever skills she has to attract admirers and pay the rent. Hahn herself spent much of her sojourn in Shanghai living close by a street frequented by American “streetwalkers” not unlike her protagonist.9. Shanghai Modern: The Flowering of a New Urban Culture in China, 1930-1945 by Leo Ou-fan Lee A classic study detailing Shanghai’s interwar cosmopolitanism, modernity and urban style. Ou-fan Lee looks at the work of six writers of the time, including Shi Zhecun, Mu Shiying and Eileen Chang, as well as commenting on Shanghai’s vibrant movie studios and publishing industry. He shows that Shanghai’s modernity, while intrinsically Chinese and profoundly anomalous, mixed easily with new ideas into the “treaty port” from the west to create the unique haipai avant garde culture of Shanghai.10. Shanghai Baby by Wei Hui (1999) Opinion has always been ided on this semi-autobiographical novel set amid the go-go boom times of the mid-to-late 1990s. As one who was there for many of those years, I find Wei captures the city in all its frenetic and cacophonous glory. In these sterner and more restrictive times of Xi Jinping, many Chinese, including those not really old enough to remember, are now looking back with a certain nostalgic fondness on the Jiang Zemin era. They see it as a time of greater freedom, opportunity and creativity, at least in Shanghai. • City of Devils by Paul French is published by riverrun, priced £14.99.

We need to have a two-year transition period and to get something sorted out during that. The idea of day-one no-deal is just crazy.”Economists have warned tougher border controls, import tariffs and other barriers to trade in the event of no-deal Brexit would have severe consequences for the economy, with one consultancy estimating the cost at around £1bn per year.Researchers at Imperial College London estimate just two extra minutes of checks could more than triple the existing queues at ports, potentially leading to motorway tailbacks in Kent up to 29 miles long.Leading Brexiters have dismissed the warnings as scaremongering and urged walking away from negotiations without a deal and striking free trade agreements around the world instead.Ministers have also attempted to downplay the concerns by suggesting they could relax efforts to collect border taxes to maintain the free movement of imports and exports in the event of no-deal.There are precedents for disruption, including Operation Stack on the M20, which forced trucks to a standstill in 2015 amid tunnel fires and industrial action in Calais. Typically used for a few days each year, it had a lengthier impact three years ago when 7,000 trucks were stranded, taking 36 hours to work their way through.Some food products did not make it to market because they went off in the queue, while others arrived so late that there were late penalties. Rolls-Royce was forced to delay its production line when goods did not arrive in time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ca1d9508982af66fd6278500ced6814dd25157e/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0198b603502ac8885265ff5ec6d5c8af","title":"labour second referendum democracy brexit","story":"People always say politics is ugly to watch up close, and they’re talking about the cynicism and manipulation, the treachery, the low cunning beneath the high rhetoric. Democracy in action is ugly in a different way, more like a jumble sale: mess, chaos, mountains of tedium, elbows everywhere. You have to stay alert because you know that underneath the polyester there’s something – not wishing to overextend an analogy, let’s call it a second vote on Brexit – that you would treasure.The Labour conference in Liverpool this week had that jumble sale feel. In any process that is remotely pluralistic, there are too many people in the room. And so 150 Labour delegates met to discuss their composite Brexit motion, boiling 150 motions from different constituency parties down to one single motion, which was passed  this afternoon.It was a heroic, multi-houred marathon on which there were scores of perspectives, none of which was “Hallelujah”. Most of the motions that were fed in had a strong anti-Brexit flavour, and were firmly supportive of a referendum on any deal. They were opposed by a loose collection of the cautious, lefty Brexiters and ultra-loyalists who would prefer not to hold the leadership to anything. The final motion read as a series of conditional measures: if the government is defeated, but if a general election isn’t called, then Labour will campaign for a public vote, whose terms are yet undecided.The post-match analysis seemed to be that this was a defanging of the members, all the better to roll them over later. In fact, this is what participation looks like: frustrating, iterative, inconclusive and interpretable. I’m told one memorable point of the meeting was Keir Starmer saying: “Right, now we have to agree what we mean by ‘consensus’.” The mind boggles as to how they kept it to five hours.In a period of flux, as a party moves from one version of democracy (nominal) to another (meaningful), proceedings are garishly splenetic. The week began with a vote on proposals from the party’s year-long democracy review. From the outside, it all looks ridiculous, tautologous, self-referential: what kind of a party has, as the first line of its agenda, a battle over its own rules?At its kernel, inevitably, was the issue of how easy it is for local party members to deselect their Labour MP. Momentum wanted mandatory reselections, which would see all Labour MPs face a selection battle against challenger candidates before every general election. It got another fudge instead: a lower threshold for triggering a full reselection selection process. Now it will happen if a third of local party branches and affiliated trade union branches express dissatisfaction with the local MP, rather than a half.The argument in favour of mandatory reselection is unremarkable and straightforward. On the one hand, if an MP is chosen by party members, why should that choice be immutable? Circumstances change the composition of the party changes MPs change. My local MP, Kate Hoey, appeared at a Brexit rally last week with Nigel Farage and David Davis. The idea that Hoey represents Vauxhall Labour party – which is fiercely anti-Brexit – is flat-out silly. On the other hand, internal contests use energy that could be directed elsewhere – towards one’s political opponents, for instance.It’s a debate that could play out quite reasonably, both sides having clear elements of truth and strength. But emotions run so high that pragmatism doesn’t get a look-in. MPs who oppose mandatory reselection say their duty is to all their constituents, not just to Labour party members, much as a parent is bound to love all their children equally. The MP Stella Creasy delivered a stinging critique of “toxic” Momentum at a rally: “If you think being political means sitting in meetings … you can do one.”If a political party is to mean anything, there has to be a mechanism that connects members to its decisions. Those members must, by definition, carry more weight than constituents who aren’t members, with the obvious proviso that anyone who wants more weight can always join. Otherwise, it’s not a democratic party – it’s a kind of political burlesque, where MPs put on a show of representation and party members distinguish themselves by cheering the loudest.But democracy is extremely painful: even if everyone were courteous, which we know they aren’t, participation is challenging. It doesn’t respect seniority. People cannot really be disciplined, only persuaded. Being political actually does mean sitting in meetings, and worse: having no control over who else is in the meeting, or what they think.It has become fashionable to say, in weary amusement, that Labour is replaying the 1980s that this is a cul-de-sac in which it has lost itself before, from which it will sooner or later emerge. But the goal is not to return to a Labour party where we can all move along because there’s nothing to see: it’s a pluralistic ecosystem so densely populated that differences cannot be obliterated by fury or stamped out by discipline, only resolved through creativity.Two days after that composite meeting, Starmer committed to a second referendum with a remain option on the ballot. It was all anyone wanted: not to erase the referendum, just to revisit it in light of the disaster of its unfolding.It was, as one conference delegate described, the result of “ordinary people making sound decisions, for the many not the few”. That’s the distinction of democracy. It’s ugly to see its workings, but it’s beautiful when it works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5711286b61c3b1cee7aa0f0463d46b5a5c33dde2/0_183_3101_1861/master/3101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee5abba0f0591e03552f51bf296351d","title":"populists immigration orban salvini law eu elections","story":"The way to take on Orbán and Salvini is to point out the dangers they pose to everyday freedoms and the rule of lawWhile the British Brexit debate rages on, it continues to ignore entirely a more important European political battle: the search for the best way to defeat populists on the continent within the next eight months – the time left before the EU parliamentary elections. That little of this seems to get factored into internal British discourse is not surprising: for all the headlines about Theresa May’s “Salzburg humiliation” or “EU dirty rats”, Brexit is essentially the British talking to themselves.Across the Channel, a new line of attack against Europe’s populists is taking shape: it focuses on breaches to democratic rule of law, rather than the issue of immigration. That’s why the most important piece of EU news this month was not the Salzburg situation (entirely predictable) but the 12 September vote in the EU parliament on the rule of law in Hungary (much less so). For the first time, an EU institution which is hard to describe as “anti-democratic” (it is elected directly by its citizens) called for the activation of article 7 procedure against a member state’s government because of the way it has been disemboweling essential democratic institutions and rights.For a long time now, Europe’s liberal democrats have been struggling to curtail political forces that threaten core principles. But since the 2015 refugee crisis they have let themselves get dragged into precisely the debate that populists can thrive on: migration. Not only was the EU at a loss over how to deal with the arrival of a million people in 2015, but its liberals have mostly failed to convince large swaths of the population that immigration is needed, that it needn’t upend social services, and that it does not spell the end of a certain sense of European or national identity.Migration conjures up fears that rational argument struggles to cope with. Hungary’s avowedly “illiberal” Viktor Orbán and Italy’s far-right Matteo Salvini have secured major electoral breakthroughs by relentlessly pounding away at migration, depicted as a “Muslim invasion” (Orbán) or as something that requires “mass cleansing, street by street” (Salvini). With that rhetoric, they are now preparing to launch their bid to take control of the EU parliament, along with like-minded European politicians.With that rhetoric also, the Swedish far right has won a position that allows it to foster political instability, as shown by this week’s no-confidence vote in Stockholm. Pushing back at these forces with talk of multiculturalism and inclusiveness will go only so far. A better strategy is to nail them on the democratic rule of law. That’s where the populist achilles heel is found and it’s where the EU has tools to act, such as article 7, which can suspend EU voting rights, or European court rulings.By this, I certainly don’t mean that the moral and legal argument for saving people fleeing war and persecution should not be made. But it may be too late now, before the May 2019 vote, to shift those parts of public opinion in Europe that have come to believe asylum is shorthand for demographic upheaval or “replacement”. Studies show European citizens overestimate the percentage of migrants in their countries (Italians believe it is three times higher than the real figure). The bare fact that migration flows have dropped steeply since 2015 does not register in perceptions. It is no coincidence that anti-immigration narratives have now spread from Europe’s hard right to its hard left – with Germany’s Sahra Wagenknecht and France’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon arguing that the arrival of migrants is a capitalist European plot to suppress workers’ wages.At this point, to shift the argument against Europe’s extremes away from migration makes much better sense.Saying that the democratic rule of law is under siege holds more political potential. This is what happened on 12 September, when two-thirds of European lawmakers drew a line marking what is acceptable and what isn’t. Think of it as a case of European checks and balances at last kicking in. The resolution voted through that day is a clear indictment of everything Orbán has done to violate democratic standards, from restricting freedom of the press to undermining the electoral system. It ought to serve as a template for a wider grassroots European campaign to protect the democratic rule of law.Rather than lambasting Orbán for rejecting the 2015 EU refugee redistribution scheme (compulsory quotas that never translated into reality), cornering him on the dismantling of mechanisms that give citizens a proper say in democracy, and allow them to make informed decisions, is likely to be more rewarding. A better way to counter Orbán and Salvini is to focus on how they threaten what protects citizens. Populists aim to destroy the safety that comes from being able to count on an independent judge if you have been the victim of abuse the safety that comes with getting pluralistic information, not state propaganda the safety that comes from being confident your shop or your business won’t be choked by kleptocratic, corrupt power networks.It helps to picture populists as a bulldozer over which a large banner reading Migrants Out has been slapped to hide the grinding wheels and huge metal shovel that are busy dismantling the democratic rule of law. It’s happened in Hungary and Poland, and it’s threatening to happen in Italy if Salvini gets his way. Ask a European citizen if they want more migrants and they may answer uneasily. Ask them if they want their government to deprive them of the tools that give people a say and the protections that come with democratic rule, and the response will be more forthright.Rule of law – as a shield against abuse of power and corruption – should be the signature theme of next year’s election.Choice of vocabulary matters too. Framing the debate as a battle of “progressives versus nationalists” has limits because populists will push back by equating “progressivism” with enforcing “open-border” or “anti-Christian” policies. A shrewder approach would be to cast this existential battle for Europe’s soul as “democrats versus authoritarians”. At the end of the day, our common enemy is autocracy. Arbitrary rule leaves citizens unprotected Europe’s body of law protects them. Populists want that to come undone, so they can redraw the continent as they like. That’s where the real, immediate danger lies – not in all the fantasising that, from Brexit to Orbán, has surrounded migration.• Natalie Nougayrède is a  columnist and leader writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcaf42f27cf416b8480e90a7313b12191a2b9d23/0_125_5118_3071/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be7f21230cc6818f4ca16f7dc47ef217","title":"the good place actor kristen bell model marriage charity work","story":"She’s made philosophy fun in The Good Place, has a model marriage and still finds time for charity work. No wonder Kristen Bell struggles to keep it all togetherLately, Kristen Bell has been fielding a lot of stymieing questions. At home, her daughters, three and five, have been asking scramblers such as, “Why is Earth?” and “Who made dogs?”. They have also been asking about death, she says, taking a sip of her green smoothie at a health food cafe in Los Feliz. “Are we going to die? When are we going to die?” – questions that dovetail eerily with their mother’s work on the set of The Good Place. In the Netflix sitcom set in the afterlife, each episode sees her character Eleanor – a self-described Arizona trash-bag whose soul is in constant threat of gut-disemboweling damnation – calibrate the least amount of ethical effort to keep herself out of The Bad Place. (Eleanor would settle for somewhere medium, the afterlife equivalent of Cleveland.) “It’s taking philosophy lessons, wrapping them in a fart joke, and making them digestible,” says Bell. Even so, the show’s creator, Mike Schur, heaps his desk with “400-page book after 400-page book after 400-page book and he’s like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s for the next episode.’”Thanks to The Good Place, Bell can now crisply outline the debate between Kantian and utilitarian philosophy. But at this moment, right in the middle of a sentence describing her personal belief in moral particularism, Bell is stumped by something she can’t explain. “Look at that. What is that?” she blurts, extracting a pair of industrial-sized shapewear knickers out of her purse. “I can’t explain.” Then she pulls out one sock, then an entirely different mismatched sock, and then a mangled sticking plaster. “I don’t know,” she sighs. Just one more mystery in the universe.She is very visible – a blonde in a bright shirt in a restaurant where everyone else is wearing black, and the most famous face in the place – yet brandishing her underwear doesn’t make her blush. “One thing I really want to do publicly – like on social media – is a, ‘What’s in my bag?’” she says, referring to the fashion magazine features that are usually just plugs for lip gloss. “Like actually videotape myself and go, ‘This is no bullshit. Here is what’s in my fucking bag.’”In The Good Place, Bell would be forced to substitute “bullshirt” and “forking” for those swear words. On Earth, her goal is to tell everything like it is, as though every day is an exercise in Celebrity Demystification. She is publicly seen as a Very Good Person, an empath who volunteers for a half-dozen charities. Thanks to The Good Place – and honestly, just being a celebrity in these tumultuous, take-a-stand years – she is often turned to as an oracle of ethics. “I personally think it’s a responsibility that if you’re lucky enough to have been handed a microphone in your short time on this planet, use it. Use it.”Within her radius, I tip extra, and yet she still tips twice as much. And yet she prefers to play characters who are selfish creeps. “That’s what I feel like!” she protests. “Look, I consider myself a very nice person and there are plenty of times I want to scream at someone on the street. And Eleanor does that – she tells people to eat their farts.”Bell and her husband, the comedian and actor Dax Shepard, are aware that their marriage inspires awe. While they were dating, he surprised her on her birthday with a live sloth, and her ecstatic, sobbing meltdown went viral. The day the supreme court legalised gay marriage, she proposed to him on Twitter. Internet strangers reply to their tweets with hashtags such as #RelationshipGoals. Instead of leaning into the mystique, Bell prefers to talk about the hard work they do every day to stay together. Couples therapy, sobriety, the challenges of monogamy, and their constant bickering, which they recently allowed people to eavesdrop on during an episode of Shepard’s podcast Armchair Expert, where they relitigated whether or not he gawped at her chest on their first date.As a child, Bell was a talented mimic. She would repeat unusual accents, Broadway warbles, even entire Lee Press-On Nails commercials from memory. Her parents split up before she was born, so to help her single mother earn extra cash, Bell began modelling for local newspaper ads when she was a pre-teen. She was small and cute, which made her perfect for posing with karaoke machines and kids’ bikes. “Every now and then, someone would bring a circular to school and be like, ‘Is this you? Ew!’” says Bell. “Kmart underwear and training bras was particularly embarrassing.” Her mother, a practising Christian, enrolled her in a Catholic high school, where she heard all the conservative fear-mongering that kept her gay friends from musical theatre hidden in the closet. Despite her daily religion classes, Bell refused to mimic their homophobia. “Definitely, people in my community had the same idea about lifestyles they were unfamiliar with, but I never had a point where I remember going, ‘Oh, being gay is OK!’ I was always like, ‘What are you talking about?’”“I was so hungry for weirdos,” says Bell. “I couldn’t be Stepford if I tried.” She pauses and reconsiders. “Well, maybe I could fit that box, but I don’t want the people around me to fit that box.” So as soon as she graduated, she moved to New York. “My first memories were just being slack-jawed at the amount of stimuli from other people and immediately recognising that I found my people.” They were in her acting classes, in her first gigs on Broadway, and even today, she refers to the crew of The Good Place as “my family members”. Bell uses the word “tribe” a lot. It’s part of her current thinking about how humanity can improve. Now that she has producer-level clout, her last three projects have instituted what she calls a “no jerks policy”. This includes no sexual harassment, no making people uncomfortable, no passive aggressiveness, and if she spots a director being rude to a crew member, they won’t be hired back.Recently, she went to a lecture by the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker and has fixated on caveman behaviour, which she refers to as the “outdated software in our brains”. Her cornerstone belief is that humans weren’t meant to live in large groups, not even places as fabulous as Manhattan. That we were meant to live in villages of 115 people, max, which is why we tend to be immediately suspicious of anyone unfamiliar. “If you and I met a couple thousand years ago in a field, we would probably kill each other,” she explains, with her friendliest smile.“There’s no bigger space that egos exist than in the non-profit world,” says Bell. Tahanis are real – and she would know. Bell’s current list of charities covers a staggering amount of ground: animal rights, prostate cancer, stem cell donation, Alzheimer’s disease, international child hunger, domestic chid poverty and young mothers raised in foster care. On birthdays, she and her friends prefer to furnish apartments for homeless people transitioning off the street rather than going out to a bar, and, this week, she will make her United Nations debut as an ambassador for the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund.“My job is not to go into politics,” Bell stresses. “My job is that I have the ear of 18-year-olds because of The Good Place or Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” It is almost impossible to imagine how she fits everything in. “Honestly, every day you quit at seven, throw in the towel, scream, and then wake up and do it all over again,” she admits. “I know from the outside it can look like, ‘Oh! She’s got it so together! And has a career that looks nice and is doing all these things with these charities.’ But I am struggling to keep it together on a day-to-day basis, and I know that’s what everyone feels like, so that’s what I like to see in my characters.”Still, she is questioning how much Hollywood loves anti-heroes. There are plenty of them in the news – do we still need them on Netflix? (Witness Bell and Kelsey Grammer as an estranged daughter and father in Like Father.) Is there a way to break Hollywood’s insistence on pitting heroes against jerks, especially when most people, even her, are both? Bell points to Frozen, the Disney blockbuster for which she voiced the lonely Princess Anna. In the first versions of the script, the frosty Princess Elsa was more of a traditional bad guy. What if they broke the mould? “In the final draft, it was like, ‘No, not only does she not need to be forgiven for anything, she’s the most sympathetic character in the whole piece,’” says Bell. “It’s a much more complex story when there’s no villain.“I want to watch someone fight for the underdog, I want to watch a hero without a cape,” says Bell. “I want to watch someone trying to be good like Eleanor.” Which means it’s the right time to resurrect Veronica Mars, the TV show about a teen detective that made her a household name. Next month, she is jumping back into production for eight new episodes that will premiere – in the US next year. “It’s not high-school crime any more,” says Bell. “It’s going to be Veronica as an adult, so it’s going to be different … and I mean that from an emotional perspective of what Veronica’s dealing with. She’s going to take on much bigger problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f6cd03c5c089861f9e11f2f0710cfda80bba0/171_115_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=010d872d0350e7937de6f55d796e36cc","title":"ebb and flow britains tidal coastline in pictures","story":"Photographers David Levene and Christopher Thomond picked spots around Britain’s coastline at high and low tideby  David Levene and  Christopher Thomond Words by  Patrick BarkhamThe tide is a long wave. The vertical movement of water pulled by a constellation of air pressure, wind, topography, the sun and the elliptical orbit of the moon is rarely visible to the naked eye. Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside.

They have been bleached white by marine heatwaves and killed off en masse by a combination of factors including pollution, overfishing, acidification and climate change.But now scientists in Florida, and other tropical locations worldwide, are attempting to stop the rot by creating coral “nurseries” in which young populations can be raised in controlled conditions before being planted on denuded reefs.Off the southern tip of Florida, a sprawling marine farming operation has been established in which corals are painstakingly grown on anchored fibreglass trees and then planted on the barrier reef.“The idea is to do as much as we can now to give these coral populations a fighting chance,” says Jessica Levy, programme manager at the Coral Restoration Foundation. “If you don’t put back the material and ersity that has been lost, the populations are going to crash and become extinct. For reefs, you’re looking at a global extinction of the ecosystem if things don’t change quickly.”The maladies are numerous and stretch back decades. A burgeoning Floridian population and mass tourism have led to water pollution and direct damage to corals, while agriculture has sent torrents of nutrients flowing on to the reef.Although regulations have curbed some of these local risks, climate change remains a big threat. In 2014 a spike in water temperatures led the Florida corals to bleach – when a reef expels its symbiotic algae under heat stress, whitens and potentially dies. It happened again in 2015, as a prolonged global bleaching event gripped the planet’s corals. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was cooked to the point that it reportedly smelled of death.The world is on course for a temperature increase that will comfortably wipe out most of the coral ecosystems, a scenario that would strip away a crucial nursery and smorgasbord for countless marine species, diminish fisheries and remove a vital coastal buffer to storms that will intensify as the planet warms.“The outlook for the Florida reef is pretty grim,” says Kim Cobb, a coral expert at Georgia Institute of Technology. “The threats are overwhelming. Just as the reef is climbing out of decades of systemic problems it is under increasing threat from climate change.”The Coral Restoration Foundation has increased the replanting of corals as the situation has deteriorated, and the foundation’s underwater trees are becoming sought-after items for stressed reefs around the world.Partnerships have formed to provide trees to places such as Jamaica and Colombia. A chartered fishing operation in Mexico is in talks to do the same. This month, it was announced that 100 corals had been successfully planted on the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest living structure, using the coral tree frames.The operation came about after tropical fish collector Ken Neidermeyer noticed a rare type of coral called stylophora growing on his live rock farm in 2003. A loophole in endangered species laws meant the coral was his to keep, so he began cutting it up to grow new coral from the fragments.Neidermeyer hoped to regrow enough coral to start patching up Florida’s reef. Initially, the fragments were mounted on sunken concentric blocks that mimicked reefs. But the real breakthrough came in 2011 with the development of fabricated trees on which dozens of pieces of coral can be dangled from the branches.Backed by funding from the federal government and concerned donors, the foundation now has around 700 trees arranged in seven nurseries along the reef system as far as Ernest Hemingway’s old haunt of Key West.Retrieved fragments of wild coral are sliced into finger-sized pieces, sorted into genomic types and strung from the fibreglass and PVC trees, which are anchored to the seabed and buoyed with a float. Alongside the staghorn and elkhorn corals, swaying gently on lines in the currents, are boulder-covering corals that are mounted on nearby platforms.This environment lets the corals grow three times faster than normal. Even so, it takes up to nine months for them to reach the size of a small football, at which point they are taken to be attached to an appropriate reef using a special putty.Diversity is key, says Levy. While some other projects are experimenting with heat-resistant corals that can cope with occasionally warming waters, the foundation hopes a range of coral candidates will produce survivors. “We don’t want to put all our eggs in the heat tolerance basket,” she says.The aim is for the corals to take root, connect and spawn with each other. So far in 2018 more than 18,000 corals have been planted on to reefs, double that achieved annually five years ago. Around eight in 10 planted corals survive at least a year.This work is laborious and occasionally fraught. The trees need to be regularly cleaned of detritus, while around 300 coral genotypes across nine species must be sorted and tagged. Regrown coral can be swiftly wiped out by hot or cold snaps, storms or disease. Hurricane Irma stripped corals off the trees, although the structures themselves were almost all unscathed.“We lost a fair bit of stock with Irma,” says Levy. “This work can be very hard as well as very rewarding. You plant corals and watch them grow for several years and then something out of your control like bleaching can happen.“It just makes us go for the numbers – the more corals we get out there the more erse it will be and the better chance something is going to survive past the continued stress.”The largest of the nurseries, located three miles off the Key Largo coast, has around 500 trees, which look a bit like giant, antiquated TV aerials. Branching staghorn and elkhorn coral dangle from the trees just 10ft underwater.A constellation of marine life, such as trumpet fish, hog fish and trigger fish, flit between the trees. A nearby reef site is dotted with replanted corals bearing the tags of the Coral Restoration Foundation, although the overall coral coverage is scant.The bleak scene is completed by stands of lifeless pillar coral, ravaged by a bacterial disease that swept through the Keys last summer. A nearby brain coral is split by jagged white lines, further evidence of disease. The origins of many coral diseases are vague but at least one major outbreak has been linked to human faecal waste: the Keys only gained a fully functioning sewer system during the past decade. Recent research has found that these diseases will worsen as the oceans warm.The scale of the foundation’s task is “monumental”, says Cobb. But the restoration work could help provide a lifeline for reefs, she says.“Corals made it through the impact that killed the dinosaurs,” she says. “I believe some corals will limp through, the question is how much will be left. There is important work that holds real promise. There won’t be just one solution but a whole basket of them, some of which we can only guess at.”Another form of reef renovation has been taking place in the Bahamas, where scientists have been collecting material from mass spawning events – when corals release plumes of sperm and eggs into the water en masse – to help produce more numerous, stronger offspring for replanting.“We’ve had pretty good results,” says Joseph Pollock, coral strategy director for the Caribbean ision of the Nature Conservancy. He worked on a recent spawning event off Cape Eleuthera that has resulted in more than one million coral larvae. “This in itself is not a solution, it’s part of a suite of tools that can be used. If you’re not working on stressors from climate change down to coastal pollution, you may as well not be doing this work.”Back in Florida, the Coral Restoration Foundation is training a new batch of interns, who will help in educational outreach efforts with the public. At the foundation’s offices, fibreglass trees are being scrubbed clean and plans made to survey a nursery site as the skies clear from a tropical storm. The work, much like the morphing climate conditions ranged against it, seems endless.“I’m not ready to give up,” says Levy. “No one wants these reefs to die on their watch, so I would rather do something then sit back and watch everything die.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e877b123cd522f0d4debdbe6b9dee1bcb4ee04f/0_196_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741c0f5027ea05b889db0af1619e8fee","title":"saint laurent walks on water with paris show reflecting its rich past","story":"Label’s latest collection takes a cue from its founder’s gift of reimagining of classic codes to create something newSaint Laurent may have dropped the Yves off its name back in 2012, but the man himself continues to bear a heavy influence on current creative director Anthony Vaccarello, who was in a reflective mood at the label’s Paris fashion week show.Sending models out on to a catwalk platform of still water where they kicked up big splashes in their wake, the designer presented a collection for the French fashion house that took its cue from the brand’s eponymous founder’s gift of reimagining classic codes to create something new.He was inspired, he explained backstage afterwards, “by the way Paloma Picasso inspired Saint Laurent in the 70s, the way she took the clothes from the 40s and made them her own”. As such, 60s shift dresses with diamanté trim merged with suiting from the same era cut from the thick jersey that Saint Laurent also used when he first established his brand. The 70s were referenced in skin-tight tuxedo suiting worn sometimes with velvet blazers, and when not with waistcoats and ruffled shirts or pussy-bow blouses.Decoration came in the form of embellished and patchworked stars and hearts, reminiscent of the motifs Saint Laurent featured in his Love postcards from the 70s to the 00s – since reproduced into posters and seen in brasseries all over Paris – while the section of the show celebrated the late designer’s love affair with Marrakech through flowing kaftans and cutout swimwear. “I don’t want to say it’s another homage,” smiled Vaccarello. “But it’s another way to talk about all the things he did.”Hemlines were short and vamp appeal was high-wattage in this collection, which Vaccarello described as “a mix of everything”. Now into his fifth women’s ready-to-wear season for the brand, the 36-year-old Italian has created a distinctive aesthetic for the house. His super-short embellished dresses and exaggerated details hark back to the unabashed, more-is-more glamour of Saint Laurent’s most fruitful creative years without teetering over the edge into “too-much” territory. It’s an aesthetic that was set off by the location of this springsummer 2019 show.Vaccarello has a penchant for an extravaganza, and fresh from unveiling his first menswear show for the house in July against the Manhattan skyline in New York, the location of Tuesday evening’s show returned to its regular haunt, the Place du Trocadero.As tourists took a front-row seat on a wall opposite the runway – or stole an eyeful from the Big Bus double-decker that stopped as it passed – and with the Eiffel Tower twinkling in the background, towering white palm trees lined the liquid catwalk. “A touch of North Africa,” he explained.In his first interview since the appointment was announced, Slimane said: “A designer is someone who expresses himself authentically through what he feels. Each has his way to tell about his time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453d580dc6356eb1b280fffca4ad5d74efe9890d/639_157_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4649f5045f70a786119ab683c07ef139","title":"judi dench rails against kevin spacey extrusion from history","story":"Dench takes issue with decision to cut actor out of Getty kidnap film All the Money in the World over sexual assault allegations, and praised his friendship in her time of griefJudi Dench has defended disgraced actor Kevin Spacey, saying she “can’t approve” of the way he was removed from the recent Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, about the J Paul Getty III kidnap, and replaced with Christopher Plummer.Speaking to journalists at the San Sebastian film festival, where she received a lifetime achievement award, Dench said Spacey was “a good friend” and had been an “inestimable comfort” and “kept me going” while they worked together on The Shipping News after the death of her husband Michael Williams in 2001.Dench said: “I can’t approve, in any way, of the fact that – whatever he has done – that you then start to cut him out of the films … Are we to do that throughout history?

Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy within, and made from nutty pulses generously spiked with fresh herbs, a freshly cooked falafel is a world away from its chilly, doughy, high-street cousin.200g split skinless fava beans (see steps 1 and 2)100g dried chickpeas5 spring onions4 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley1 big bunch coriander1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp ground coriander1½ tsp Lebanese seven-spice (or ½ tsp ground black pepper and ¼ tsp each ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg)1 tsp saltSunflower or vegetable oil, for frying½ tsp baking powder4 tbsp sesame seedsThough they tend to be made with chickpeas in much of the Middle East, in Egypt, where falafel is said to have originated, they favour dried broad beans, giving them a smoother, softer consistency. I favour a Lebanese-style mixture of the two, using the beans as a binder and the chickpeas to add texture and flavour.Dried fava beans are easily found in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean grocers and wholefood shops, and even more easily online, where you can even source British-grown beans from the Norfolk-based Hodmedods: go for ready-shelled split versions, if possible, to save yourself a fiddly, if very simple job. Interesting fact: fava beans have been grown here since the Iron Age.Put the fava beans and chickpeas in separate bowls and cover both generously with cold water. Leave to soak overnight, or for about eight to 12 hours (if you need to leave them longer, refrigerate the bowls so the pulses don’t start to ferment), then drain, again keeping the two separate. Tip on to clean tea towels and roughly dry.Put all the beans and about half of the chickpeas into a food processor and pulse until fairly smooth: remember, they’re still raw and crunchy, so don’t push your machine too hard by leaving it running continuously. If you don’t have a food processor, improvise with a potato masher, pestle and mortar or a fork – and a lot of elbow grease.Finely slice the spring onions and crush or mince the garlic. Remove the coarse stems from the parsley, then roughly chop the leaves along with the coriander (you can leave the stalks on the latter, unless they’re very dirty). Add to the food processor with the spices, salt and remaining chickpeas, and whizz or mix just to roughly combine: the mixture should still be lumpy.Heat a dash of oil in a small pan over a medium-high heat and fry a teaspoon of the mixture until crisp leave to cool a little, then taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Stir in the baking powder (this will make the falafel extra-fluffy), then chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes – this will make it easier to shape.Wet your hands, then roll dessert spoons of the mixture into small, flattish balls or ovals about 5-6cm across. Pour the sesame seeds on to a plate and roll the balls across them until lightly coated. Fill a heavy-based, deep pan about a third full of oil and heat to about 180C (or use a deep-fat fryer to do the same).Fry the falafel in batches until crisp and golden (about five minutes), turning once, then drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with a little salt. Keep the cooked falafel warm in a low oven while you repeat with the rest of the mix, then serve as quickly as possible in flatbreads with crunchy salad, and preferably some pickles and tahini sauce (see step 9).To make tahini sauce, blend 75g light tahini paste with a crushed clove of garlic, the juice of half a lemon, and just enough water to give it a pourable consistency. Season to taste you may also like to add more garlic or lemon juice, if you think it needs it. This sauce keeps well in the fridge, so you can make it in advance, if you like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0385d30aa0029354921b0160d790c8dec7677c2c/0_30_1399_839/master/1399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d53fe854081c979fbbd0a40bd0754ec","title":"jose mourinho paul pogba never captain manchester united","story":"• United manager unhappy with player’s performances• French midfielder wants the side to be more attackingJosé Mourinho has told Paul Pogba he will never captain Manchester United again, though the manager denied that there was any issue between him and the Frenchman.Pogba’s demotion emerged before United endured a shock defeat by Derby as they crashed out of the Carabao Cup here on Tuesday night. They lost 8-7 on penalties after a 2-2 draw, with Phil Jones’s kick saved by Scott Carson.Pogba was at the match and when Mourinho was asked if he had fallen out with him, the manager said: “The only truth is that I made the decision for Paul – not to be the second captain any more.“It was exactly the same person who decided Paul was the second captain – myself. No fallout at all, just decisions I do not have to explain.”Despite the denial, the move places the midfielder’s future at the club in serious doubt. Pogba was rested from the match-day squad before a defeat that will also place Mourinho under further scrutiny regarding the direction of the side and his own future.The 55-year-old’s decision regarding Pogba and the captaincy is the latest fracture in their relationship. Pogba has previously signalled a wish to leave and he could now be sold in January.Last season, Pep Guardiola revealed that Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, informed the Manchester City manager the player would be interested in departing United for the champions during the winter window.Barcelona also made a £45m offer for Pogba in the summer, a bid that was rejected by United and may have been made due to encouragement from the player’s camp.Pogba had been given the armband by Mourinho for three matches this season in the absence of Antonio Valencia. He has performed erratically and after the 1-1 draw with Wolves at Old Trafford on Saturday seemed to question Mourinho’s tactics, stating that United should “attack, attack, attack” more.It followed Pogba saying after the opening-day win against Leicester that he would be fined for saying certain things, having returned a man‑of-the-match display.After Tuesday’s defeat Mourinho again questioned his players’ attitude. He said: “You know it happened that we didn’t score when we could and we could in the first half to kill it. We didn’t.“At half-time I repeated the words I said in the last match. Their dressing room is a dressing room with belief and we need to go and kill the game, which we didn’t.”Goals from Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini for United and Derby’s Harry Wilson – on loan from Liverpool, the Premier League leaders – and Jack Marriott had sent the tie to the shootout.Mourinho, though, denied any criticism of the team. “You say I criticise, I don’t,” he said. “I don’t think you are correct saying I am criticising the team. You want me to say we play a phenomenal match? The truth is the opponent in the second half started better than us, we responded at 1-1.“I would lie if I said we threw the match away. With a draw in the past you had 30 more minutes to play but without extra time you go straight to penalties and that goes against the team who with 30 extra minutes would win the match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04b39b1d7dfa98743d66d0dac0ff77a648c2b429/41_96_3581_2148/master/3581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20929d27a4d34b558298aeecb487a044","title":"manchester united derby county carabao cup match report","story":"On a day when José Mourinho and Paul Pogba’s relationship hit rock bottom came a testing night for the Portuguese as Derby County knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup.Phil Jones saw his kick saved by Scott Carson and given Mourinho’s ongoing discontent with Pogba, plus a defeat that adds to United’s drift, the manager will come under further scrutiny.Jack Marriott’s late header had been answered by Marouane Fellaini’s in injury time after United had ceded the initiative following Juan Mata’s early goal. In the second half a Harry Wilson equaliser was followed by Sergio Romero becoming the third United player in five matches to receive a red card – for handling the ball outside the area on 67 minutes – before Fellaini’s intervention seem to have saved home blushes.This was a famous win for Derby and a particularly sweet one for the manager, Frank Lampard, who spoke before of his admiration for Mourinho, under whom he enjoyed glittering success at Chelsea.Mourinho made nine changes, retaining only Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard from Saturday’s draw here with Wolves. Pogba was among those missing, although he was one of a number of players the manager stated was rested.Lampard’s XI was the same as that beat Brentford 3-1 last time out yet any hope of a famous win was dented after three minutes following a flowing move.Anthony Martial showed his class with a neat first touch and raced down the left. A cross was flicked on by Lukaku, Lingard dummied, and Mata swept past Carson.The perfect start for United came close to being matched by Derby. As United dawdled Mason Bennett’s effort required a fine save from Romero.Next came a moment of United quality. Ashley Young, wearing the armband, pinged in a sweet 40-yard pass that bypassed the visiting defence and landed on Mata’s toes. The No 8 killed the ball but could not beat Carson and a corner from the left ensued.Young took this and saw his delivery ricochet off Carson’s right post in a fortunate escape for Derby. The sense of an open contest in which United might streak ahead at this point was confirmed when Richard Keogh made a serious error in front of Carson. He gave the ball away to Lukaku, yet after racing in on goal his attempt went wide. Derby’s response came via a Keogh advance from the back but the central defender’s 20-yard shot missed to Romero’s right.Martial was unlucky to be dropped for the Wolves game following an eye-catching display against Young Boys and he was in effervescent mood again here. After skipping to near the left byline he crossed and Lukaku might have doubled the lead but the centre-forward mistimed his jump and over went the header.Keogh continued to make errors. Just before the half-hour the captain dawdled and looked to have given possession away again in the danger zone but he managed to recover. Unlike Lampard, who stood throughout the opening period, Mourinho waited 31 minutes before leaving his seat and when he did this was to remonstrate at some lax play from the team. The Portuguese was also frustrated that United had not been more ruthless – a regular refrain of his – as at the break their lead remained just the single goal.As this juncture neared Martial advanced and looked to thread the ball to Lukaku who lurked near the penalty spot but he lacked precision just as the side had thus far lacked the killer edge.The second half began with Lukaku having to head clear a Derby free-kick and Romero hitting a regulation clearance against an opposing player and the visitors winning a corner moments later.This United performance was beginning to be reminiscent of Saturday’s slipshod display and of so many under Mourinho. Derby were becoming the ascendant side and Romero was again required to protect the lead as more schoolboy marking allowed Wilson in though the wide man could not beat the Argentinian.United were unable to get hold of the ball and dictate the contest and when Johnson flew into Martial with a tackle near halfway this summed up how much more urgent Derby were.This all pointed to what came on the hour. Wilson, a Liverpool loanee, stepped up to take a 30-yard free-kick that he curled from right to left, sending Romero the wrong way for a memorable equaliser.Mourinho reacted instantly. He took off Lingard and Ander Herrera for Fred and Fellaini yet the travelling support’s own response was to inform the 55-year-old he was “getting sacked in the morning”.Now came disaster for United as Romero was sent off by the referee, Stuart Atwell, for handling outside the area as Wilson raced on to the ball. This meant Lee Grant – who played for Derby for 11 years in two spells, with more than 170 appearances – entering for his United debut at the age of 35 to set up a frantic finish, which included one fine save.Now came the final whistle, Mourinho’s misery and Lampard’s joy. The latter said: “I’m shell-shocked. To go down early at Old Trafford and play as well as they did was superb. I am a proud manager. It was the easiest selection I have had.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Random kit manufacturing question,” begins Michael Pilcher. “Since Paul Scally took over Gillingham in 1995, aside from a stint when UhlsportVandanel made them from 2005-2014, our shirts have been made in-house by ‘Gills Leisure’‘GFC’‘GFC Leisure’. Are Gillingham the only club that manufacture their own kits in the EFL? How far down do you have to go before you find another club that designs and makes their kits under an ‘own brand’? Even our Kent non-league neighbours Maidstone and Dover use established kit brands (Dover were Nike last season).”The short answer is: lots. We’ll let our readers offer a more thorough response, starting with a couple of current ones, Bristol City and Sheffield Wednesday, with the clubs’ respective owners, Steve Lansdown and Dejphon Chansiri, influential. “Bristol Sport have been the supplier of Bristol City’s kit since the 2014-15 season,” writes Nick Hanling. “Both are part of a group of companies that also includes Bristol City Women, Bristol Bears, Bristol Ladies Rugby, Bristol Flyers, Bristol Jets and Bristol Sport Racing. Guess who supplies the kit for most of them. Is there another example of an in-house football kit supplier who also supplies kit for teams in other sports? City also had Nibor as a kit supplier for a few years in the 90s. As Nibor is Robin spelt backwards, this could have been an in-house brand. Either way, they introduced the glorious purple and lime green away kit as immortalised by Brian Tinnion at Anfield and me at my Thursday night football.”As for Wednesday, Ryan Sandrey offers: “They have manufactured their own kits for two seasons now under the ‘Elev8’ brand owned by Wednesday chairman Chansiri. Chansiri is also the only sponsor on the shirts, with last season’s away shirt amusingly being sponsored by Elev8 energy drink, with the same branding as the manufacturer. This attempt to input more money into the club to ensure compliance with FFP didn’t work out so well for us, as we had an embargo over the summer that didn’t lift until a week before the end of the loan window.”Rowing back a few years, Elliot Rawstrone tells us how Preston sculpted their own strip between 1996-2000, while Jamie Varley brings news of Luton Town. “We had kits made in the late-1990s (definitely 1999-2000 season) with the shirt manufacturer logo OS,” he muses. “I’m pretty sure this stood for Official Supporters. There was also one in 1994 that had “Hatters” (our nickname) as the shirt manufacturer logo.” Not so long ago Southampton stuck two fingers up to Adidas and wore their own-brand kit for 2014-15, as Derek McGee reminds us. “Adidas terminated their kit deal with Saints after only one season. As it turns out, it wasn’t the first time either. When their deal with Pony came to an end in 1999, Southampton produced own brand kits until a deal was agreed with Umbro in 2008.”“Which players have scored in consecutive games past the same goalkeeper for club then country or country then club?” tweets Daniel Storey.“I’d like to offer former Ipswich Town and England keeper Richard Wright,” declares Jonathan Cullen, “who holds the illustrious record of scoring and conceding past himself for club and country in consecutive games at the same ground.“Wright played in the play-off final for Ipswich Town against Barnsley at Wembley on 29 May 2000, when he was unfortunate enough to score an own goal in the sixth minute, the ball rebounding off the post and in off his shoulder. Ipswich went on to win 4-2 and Wright was called up by England for a friendly against Malta, again at Wembley, just four days later. He went on to repeat the trick, conceding a penalty in the 20th minute, which resulted in the ball again rebounding off the post and in, this time off his head.”You can watch Wright’s woes below:“Arsenal have scored 10 goals so far this season, all from 10 different scorers (including one own goal),” notes Alex Hanrahan. “What’s the highest number of different scorers recorded from the start of a season?”Blackburn Rovers can lay a claim to this, according to Scott Sumner. “At the start of the 2001-02 season, Rovers had 13 different goalscorers for their first 13 goals of the season: Nathan Blake, David Beckham (own goal), Keith Gillespie, Alan Mahon, Damien Duff, Matt Jansen, Lucas Neill, Corrado Grabbi, Garry Flitcroft, David Dunn, Damien Johnson, Grant McCann (own goal) and Tugay. This is certainly a Premier League record – and it must have a strong claim for being an all-time record.”“I was recently watching the third Test between India and West Indies,” wrote Manas Phadke in July 2011. “I was quite surprised to see umpire Billy Doctrove sitting in a stand named after him, wearing a Liverpool jersey and kissing the badge for the cameras. Are there any other umpires in international cricket (present or past) who have publicly pledged their allegiance to a football club?”Roy Proctor was on hand with a few answers. “The most obvious cricket umpire to have a publicly acknowledged football affiliation is the incomparable Harold ‘Dickie’ Bird, who in an article for the  in 2008 proclaimed: ‘I’ve supported Barnsley for 70 years so there’s no way I will miss this afternoon.’ The afternoon in question was an FA Cup quarter-final between the Tykes and Chelsea, a match Barnsley won. Another, more current, umpire is Ian Gould, a wicketkeeper who played in goal for Slough Town and Arsenal’s youth team, earning him the nickname ‘Gunner’. In July 2009, Gould became chairman of Burnham FC of the Southern Football League. And although I’m not sure which team he supports, the legendary West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor, like Gould, was a goalkeeper, playing for Jamaica at schoolboy level. He went on to be a referee and took charge of a World Cup qualifier.”• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Has there been, or is there, a professional player with more umlauts in their surname than Leicester City’s Cağlar Söyüncü?” wonders Ben Fisher.“During the Champions League final earlier this year, there was a point when four, or maybe five, Liverpool players were all caught offside at once,” mails Oliver Rowe. “Is this a record?”“In the summer Paul Hurst took over as Ipswich manager, with John Askey replacing him as Shrewsbury boss and Mark Yates, in turn, filling the vacancy Askey left at Macclesfield,” writes Andy Boyd. “So far this season they have managed one league win between them. Is this potentially the worst ever instance of a managerial chain?”Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db8de62d80c08a9137b392bfbcf4b0abcbf6ded9/181_375_4738_2842/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5497704279dcf87db6b5125523a3e9b9","title":"sergi canos interview brentford arsenal liverpool carabao cup","story":"Brentford’s former Barcelona graduate seems to have found a spiritual home at Griffin Park and is looking forward to taking on Arsenal in the Carabao CupThese days, Canós plays for a team some dub the Barcelona of the Championship: Brentford. The winger dismisses such a comparison but admits there are shades of his Spanish schooling in Dean Smith’s side, who visit Arsenal in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday. After a 2-0 win over Wigan this month, the club’s owner, Matthew Benham, tweeted the words “liquid football”. Canós chuckles.“A lot of people compare us with them. Barcelona is Barcelona but Brentford is Brentford. The counter-pressing, moving the ball quick, wide players giving width. It is basically the same. We are all different but we try to play good football. It is great for us I don’t think anyone – maybe Leeds – plays like we play.“Teams come to Griffin Park and don’t play how they play at home. They try and stop us playing. That’s amazing, because they are worried about us. That’s kind of a respect. We don’t defend that much. We defend with the ball and that’s important. I think it’s going to be a great game I hope we can show Arsenal what Brentford are all about.”Canós, who was born in Nules, 50km north of Valencia, lived with around 100 others at La Masia, the stone farmhouse residence a few feet from the Camp Nou. Guardiola, another graduate from that fabled structure, was a regular visitor. It was at La Masia where Barcelona’s academy players born outside the city were housed until 2011, when a new site was opened at the Joan Gamper training base.As a kid Canós went to Mestalla with his father, Pepe, to watch Valencia and players such as his childhood idol David Villa, Kily González and Gaizka Mendieta. He played for Castellón and Eyol, having rejected Villarreal – “they used to call my mum every morning” – before joining Liverpool from Barcelona as a 16-year-old.At La Masia Canós roomed for three years with Julio Pleguezuelo, who departed in the same summer for Arsenal. Josimar Quintero also left, for Chelsea. Canós had witnessed Héctor Bellerín and Jon Toral make similar moves to English clubs. “We all lived together, you see them every day and they were older but you see them step into English football,” he says of a path also taken by Cesc Fàbregas in 2003. “They are like your brothers. I think I was 14 when Héctor and Jon left and I thought: ‘If the opportunity comes, why not take it?’ When I was 16 Liverpool came and I took that opportunity.”For two months Canós lived with a family in West Derby, round the corner from Melwood, to improve his English, before his parents and younger sister, Judit, joined him, with his father opening a tapas restaurant called Gracias off Penny Lane. As for the move itself Canós, who conducts this interview in effortless English, considered it a no-brainer.“In Barcelona they said you can be in under-18s, under-19s, but I couldn’t play real football. Liverpool offered me real football and I trained with the first team sometimes. For a kid of 16 that was amazing. If you get told that in the next months you are going to train with Luis Suárez, Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers as a manager – you take it. I’d take it now, in five years and in 10 years.”He made only one appearance, against West Bromwich Albion in May 2016, and left Liverpool that summer. A successful loan at Brentford whetted his appetite for first-team football and his mind was made up. “After Christmas I took the decision I didn’t want to sign a new contract with Liverpool. They offered me five years more but I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to be one more I wanted to be important and I didn’t want to go on loan again.“To sign for five more years at Liverpool, it meant that my career was going to depend on Liverpool, them making decisions for me. They didn’t offer me the opportunity to try and train and play for the first team. I made my debut but it wasn’t a good thing, I don’t think. It was a good thing because then they could sell me for £2.5m to Norwich.”Canós found a six-month stint in Norfolk difficult, and a return to Brentford, the club he fell in love with, beckoned. Last season the Bees made a late charge for the play-offs and this time they are determined to go one better. After a second defeat of the season, at Derby on Saturday, they slipped to seventh but in Neal Maupay they have the ision’s top scorer and in the forward Ollie Watkins and defender Ezri Konsa, two of the country’s brightest young talents.Canós, still only 21, counts himself lucky to have tasted so many different experiences. Asked what’s next, he replies: “The future is getting to the Premier League with Brentford.” Is it possible? “Yes, of course. You just have to come to Griffin Park and watch us play.”• Among Canos’s class at Liverpool was Harry Wilson, the Wales winger who showcased further evidence of his quality with a stunning, swerving free-kick for Derby County at Old Trafford. It was a special night not only for the loanees Wilson and Mason Mount but also for the academy graduate Jayden Bogle. “At every opportunity, within reason, I will include young players that show in their work that they deserve to be included,” Frank Lampard said on the eve of this season.• A trip to Bristol City on Friday night may prove the perfect tonic for Aston Villa, with Steve Bruce under increasing pressure after one win in their past eight matches in all competitions. Having retained Jack Grealish and bolstered his squad with Yannick Bolasie and Tammy Abraham – among four former City players set to feature at Ashton Gate – Bruce has been armed with a squad to compete at the top, and they have to start doing so.• Accrington Stanley are still trying to reunite a fan … with their false teeth. The League One club – who this week tied their manager John Coleman to a new contract after a solid start – posted a picture of the rogue dentures after a win over AFC Wimbledon, a result that lifted them to ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f834d47749ab1a0b202969f45c2ec7a76bf68c0/0_79_6729_4039/master/6729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138535fe790811e54ed32f47e0db94ed","title":"fifa 19 review","story":"PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch EAWith new shooting options, the Champions League and a madcap no-rules mode, the era’s defining sports sim tots up another winThe Fifa series has been adhering to one clear philosophy over the past two decades. Let’s call it “Hollywood authenticity”. Matches look and feel realistic, the animation is astonishingly accurate, the presentation has all the swooshing graphic wizardry we’ve come to expect in the Sky TV era. Squint and you can almost imagine you’re watching a real game.Yet beneath those overhead kicks that rocket into the top corner, those last-minute goals from set pieces, every match feels somehow authored – as if, hidden away somewhere and secretly controlling every action is a sinister cabal of Roy of the Rovers writers.But that’s OK, because playing Fifa 19 is a joy: the control, the fluidity, the sense of possibility from every graceful character animation. More so than the last few instalments, the action is balletic and refined. A boost of speed, a well-timed pass, a shimmy to the left, and the pitch opens up like a theatrical stage. It’s thrilling. At the same time, tackling is hard, there’s more uncertainty to 5050 balls (you can actually win some above the professional skill level), and there’s a nice sturdy physics engine which means overhit passes and ricocheting balls can often act unpredictably, spinning off your player’s shin, however skilled he or she may be.Outfield play is open and when you get into the penalty area, you find that shooting has been tweaked too. Now there is the chance to make a well-timed second tap of the shoot button to launch a more decisive strike. It’s tough to get right .Most of the time you’ll want to just go with a basic blast-and-hope approach, but it’s important for Fifa to keep providing more options in front of goal, especially with the ever-improving AI of defenders.From these intertwining systems of physics, animation and attacking scope, great goals are possible. There are the overhead kicks, of course, but also swooping headers from the edge of the box. Somehow, I’ve made Andy Carroll score at the near post, using the outside of his foot to curl it around a flailing keeper with all the poise and refinement of a young Baryshnikov. That was one to treasure – and that is what “Hollywood authenticity” is all about. The unreal real.And of course, Fifa is also about its huge array of options. There is the latest instalment of The Journey, the game’s interactive TV box-set series, now following Alex Hunter, his sister Kim and his laddish pal Danny Williams through their winding careers and giving players control over life-changing moments and decisions. It’s still silly and histrionic, like a Channel 5 drama, but fun while it lasts.Career Mode has barely changed, but the basic multiplayer match option now lets you choose from a number of fun playground options including Headers and Volleys and No Rules, where there is no ref and no decisions – sort of post-apocalyptic football. EA has also brought in the Champions League, so you can take a side to European glory while getting heartily sick of the competition’s operatic theme tune.Then there’s Ultimate Team. The online team-creation mode, which lets you build a fantasy side and pitch it against others around the globe, returns with cosmetic and interface improvements and a bunch of new player cards. It’s still a compelling live-action Panini sticker album with a problematic loot-box element that allows real-world cash transactions for randomised rewards.But really, this remains a game about the fantasy of elite-level football. It feels as though some of the pernickity augmentations to ball control and jostling that were forced on us between Fifas 15 and 18 have been toned back, or at least superseded by systems that are actually fun. Fifa 19 is a game that flatters without being sycophantic, and gives attackers and defenders chances to look amazing in equal measure. It lets you run at centre-backs with joie de vivre, dinking the ball around them, but it also lets you glide in with a monstrous sliding tackle like Paolo Maldini in his prime.Fifa 19 is a true simulation of modern football: brash and bloated yet also slickly professional sometimes it drives you crazy with its cynicism, others it almost makes you weep with its beauty. And it truly knows how mixed-up and daft it is. After I scored one particularly outrageous goal with Cristiano Ronaldo, commentator Lee Dixon yelled: “It’s just like he’s playing Fifa.” So meta. So obvious. So true."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fdcd38006ba7bc80140e8ded7974aabd86cf56/0_327_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ca346c75b1dee7db02ba32e4e455ab2","title":"truth about polyamory monogamy open relationships","story":"More and more young people are abandoning monogamy in favour of open relationships. But is it really that easy to turn your back on jealousy? And what about all the admin?Alex Sanson is nervous. She is hosting a dinner party this Friday, and wants it to go well, because her lovers are coming – all of them. “Cooking for one person you fancy is hard enough, but three of them is even more stressful!” says Sanson, who has brown hair, an open, friendly face and a bookish air..Sanson is polyamorous, meaning that she has multiple romantic and sexual partners, all of whom are aware of the others’ existence. Currently, the 28-year-old is in a “polycule” with three other people: William, Mike and Laura, all of whom are also dating the other members of the polycule.Dinner-party jitters aside, things are going swimmingly for Sanson, who works in marketing. “There’s so much joy in being poly,” she says. “It’s lovely not to burden one person with all your stuff. You just spread it all out.”Polyamory, also known as consensual non-monogamy, seems to be growing in popularity among young people, though with no definitive figures it’s hard to know how much of this is a matter of increased visibility. It comes in many shapes and forms, from open relationships (where in layperson’s terms you “cheat” on your partner, but they are aware and do not mind, and do the same to you), to solo polyamory, where you identify as polyamorous, but are not currently in multiple relationships. But all those involved reject monogamy as stifling, or oppressive, or simply not to their taste.“It’s not as complicated as people make it sound,” Sanson insists. If you are unsure whether polyamory might suit you, try this simple thought experiment: does the thought of your partner in the first flushes of romantic ardour with another person fill you with contentment, lust, indifference, or murderous rage? If it’s the last one, best to swerve polyamory. (There’s a term for the warm feeling polyamorous people experience when seeing their partners with someone else: compersion.)“I’ve had people saying to me, ‘You just want to fuck about!’” says 29-year-old Calum James, who identifies as a heteroflexible pansexual solo polyamorous relationship anarchist. What this basically means is that James, who is mostly straight, is not currently in a polyamorous relationship with a person or persons. If he were, he would regard it as no more important than non-intimate friendships, because relationship anarchists treat romantic and non-romantic relationships the same.“I had one woman have a go at me, saying, ‘It’s an awful way to treat women,’” James says. “But people don’t understand it’s not just about meeting women and having sex with them. I want to build deep connections with people and see them regularly. I just don’t want those connections to follow the same rules as traditional relationships.”James tried monogamy, but found it “suffocating”. “I never understood monogamy, even when I was a kid. I’d think, ‘I fancy three people in my class.’”“The thing I’ve always disliked about monogamy and marriage,” Sanson adds, “is the idea of owning another person and them being your other half or somehow completing you, like you weren’t complete before you met them. What I love about polyamory is that I’m my own person and no one owns me. I don’t own any of you, either. We’re all free.”Polyamory is having a cultural moment right now, with celebrities such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith speaking about being non-monogamous, and the BBC drama Wanderlust depicting a middle-class couple as they open up their relationship. As anyone who lived through the 1960s, or who is from the LGBT community will tell you, polyamory is not new: free love or non-monogamy has been practised for years. But polyamory is now being adopted by people who might have been monogamous five or 10 years ago, not least because the internet makes it easier than ever for poly-curious people to educate themselves about polyamory, and connect with like-minded iniduals.“Things are changing rapidly,” says Janet Hardy, the co-author of the polyamory handbook The Ethical Slut. “More people are getting the idea that it’s possible to be happy and healthy without being monogamous. What I’m seeing among young people is that they don’t have the same need to self-define by what they like to do in bed, or in relationships, like my generation did. Everything’s out on a big buffet, and they try a little of everything.”Polyamorous people reject the end game of romantic monogamy, and disdain so-called “relationship escalators”: society’s expectation that couples will cycle through #putaringonit selfies, marriage and kids. Instead, they let their relationships flow whither the current takes them, relinquishing themselves to the whorls and eddies that change all romantic partnerships over time. In our increasingly precarious times, it makes sense that polyamory is popular. “Growing up, you’re bombarded by all this messaging about what the perfect relationship set-up is,” Sanson says. “You’re going to have a family and buy a house and do this and that. But a lot of that isn’t relevant to my generation.”Still, being polyamorous isn’t just a carefree romp. It requires you to unpick the messy yarn of human emotion, and that most familiar knot of all: jealousy. Perhaps the biggest myth of all about polyamorous people is that they don’t feel jealousy. “Jealousy is a part of human nature,” says 27-year-old William Jeffrey, a member of Sanson’s polycule. “You still feel it. But I’ve found with every jealousy I’ve ever had while being polyamorous, I’ve been able to trace the jealousy back to an insecurity about myself. When I figure out what the insecurity is, I can overcome it.”A responsible polyamorous partner accepts the other person’s jealousy. “When I started dating someone else, my partner Laura expressed that she was feeling jealous,” says Mike Scoins, 28, also in the polycule. “So I told her: ‘I acknowledge your feelings. Can we unpack the fear that is underlying your jealousy?’ In this instance, it was something along the lines of: ‘Do you still care about me?’ When you provide reassurance that, yes, absolutely, I do still care, the jealousy dissipates.”Is jealousy only ever the result of insecurity? “I’d say that’s too simplistic a view,” says Hardy. “I don’t think there’s one emotion you can call jealousy. I think jealousy is an umbrella we put over all of the emotions we find difficult that we want to quell by changing someone else’s behaviour.” In her introduction-to-polyamory workshops, Hardy asks participants to write a thank-you note to their jealousy. “It exists for a reason. Jealousy tries to protect you from something.”Can you really vanquish the green-eyed monster with introspection and communication alone? “Some people are more prone to jealousy, and some people are less prone to it,” Hardy says. “If polyamory sounds unpleasant, don’t do it! There are no merit badges here.”“I don’t really experience sexual jealousy,” Scoins muses. “My one experience of jealousy was when my then partner had two tickets for a ball and didn’t give me one.”There’s a joke about polyamory: it didn’t take off until Google Calendar was invented. The polyamorous people I interview effortlessly manage packed schedules. Jeffrey, for instance, will meet once a week to play a Buffy the Vampire Slayer role-playing game with Scoins and the fourth member of their polycule, Laura Nevo. He also has a weekly date night with his live-in partner, as well as seeing Sanson and Nevo once a week.While shows such as Wanderlust depict polyamory as a tumescent bonk-fest, in reality polyamorous people spend most of their time doing the deeply unsexy business of talking about their feelings. Sanson credits polyamory with giving her more emotional self-awareness. “Polyamory has allowed me to be more introspective, think about the motives behind what I’m doing, identify emotions more accurately and be explicit about how I’m feeling about things.”Polyamory tends to unnerve people, affronting expectations of traditional romantic monogamy. It’s harder for polyamorous people to date: apps such as Tinder or Bumble don’t have options for non-monogamous people, for instance. When James writes in his Tinder bio that he is non-monogamous, he experiences a “significant dip in matches”. And when he tells prospective romantic partners he is polyamorous, it rarely goes down well. “One date told me, ‘I was really interested in you until you told me that.’”Last New Year’s Eve, James went to a party in Sheffield, where he lives. When he walked in, heads swivelled. “They all went: ‘Is that the polyamorous one?’” James is weary of having to defend his way of life, and rightly so: consenting adults shouldn’t have to justify their sex lives to judgmental strangers. “Some people don’t recognise that what’s not right for them isn’t not right for other people,” he says. “I try to point out that it’s not harming anybody if it’s all open and honest.”And monogamous people can learn from polyamory. Twenty-three-year-old Aliyah, who uses theythem pronouns, was polyamorous, but is currently in a monogamous relationship. They credit polyamory with giving them a healthier outlook on monogamy. “The way I was taught monogamy wasn’t healthy,” Aliyah says. “I’d have this constant paranoia of being cheated on.”Polyamory made them better at monogamy. “I learned that monogamy doesn’t have to be as strict as we conceptualise it growing up,” they explain. “Before I felt that deep love should only be reserved for romantic connections. But being polyamorous taught me I have so much love for my friends, and that doesn’t have to be explored in a sexual context.”As polyamory becomes more visible, it won’t be seen as such a tear in our social fabric, but as an ordinary and unremarkable thing. This will be down to the efforts of a new generation who are normalising their freedom to live and love how they want, without nose-wrinkling or head-shaking.“My dad said to me to me the other day, ‘I’m worried about your emotional wellbeing, because you’re building relationships with these people,’” Sanson laughs. “And I was like, ‘I know! That’s the whole point.”Chiara Giovanni, 24, is in a relationship with two people. Her partner Aditya Sharad, 23, is monogamous.Chiara: I always struggled with monogamy and found it quite restrictive. Even though I was super-happy in my relationships, I wasn’t able to be monogamous and faithful. I decided to take a different tack. When I met Aditya I thought, I love this person and want to make them happy, and I need to do this differently. So I was open from the start.Ninety per cent of polyamory is talking. Sometimes I think, I want to watch a movie! I don’t want to talk about our relationship again. But it’s important to be able to express your fears, rather than waiting for the worst thing to happen.I definitely think more people would be polyamorous if they knew what polyamory was, and that it wasn’t just a phase, but valid and long-term and serious. Right now, I’m setting up a time for Aditya to meet my other partner, who is based in the US. They are both super-nervous and really want the other person to like them. It’s really cute.Aditya: At first, when a partner says, “I don’t think conventional relationship settings are working for me,” it’s hard to hear. While Chiari and I decided it would be a polyamorous relationship, I’m not a hugely social person, so it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to have multiple relationships. At the same time, I have a wonderful relationship with Chiara, who I really love. So I thought, let’s give this a try.Jealousy is never the main feeling. Something may trigger the jealousy, but it’s not a primary feeling. You’ll be feeling insecure about something, and that’s what the jealousy is about. You have to communicate about your feelings, and accept you’re not going to be given all the time and attention in your relationship.I do feel fulfilled. I wouldn’t have chosen to be poly myself, but I value Chiara. We have a joyous and uplifting relationship. So it’s not like her being polyamorous is a necessary evil. I’m just invested in what allows us to lead a life together, and what is important to her, and makes her happy.If you’d told me about polyamory eight years ago I’d have been like, “What, really, that works?” But it does. You need to be intentional about it, but it can work.Laura Nevo, 30, is part of a four-person polycule, along with William Jeffrey, Alex Sanson, and Mike Scoins.I started polyamory as an experiment. I had been in monogamous relationships all my life, and when I met my partner Mike he was honest with me. He said: “I like you, but I’m going to carry on dating other people.” I thought, fair enough. I did some research into polyamory and began to date multiple people. In previous monogamous relationships, I’d cheat on my partners and feel guilty about it. I didn’t want that to happen again.I’ve been dating Mike for two years and William for one year. I also hang out a lot with Alex, and there are other people I may have sex with. It gives me a lot of happiness to see my partners together, like William and Mike for example. It’s nice to be able to be happy for someone else, without having to be a part of their happiness.Recently, I had a challenge because one of my partners became involved with someone I really didn’t connect with. I’m trying to work through that and not bottle things up. I used to suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, but I’ve found that polyamory helps me a lot, as I have to really figure things out.When someone new comes into our polycule, I’m extra careful of things. I think, how can we deal with this new person? How can we make them comfortable? Because it’s not nice to feel left out.Being polyamorous has felt freeing for me. It has allowed me to meet people I wouldn’t have considered as partners before. I’ve been playing more on the gender spectrum. If I were to go back to monogamy one day, I think the experience of being polyamorous would make me more accepting of people and different types of relationships.Andrea, 30, believes in ‘free and independent agency’Coming out as non-monogamous is a very slow process, because it’s so hard to bring yourself to a point where you know that the other person might terminate the relationship. Some choose to cheat, but I wanted to be open to the person I loved.When I came out as non-monogamous to my girlfriend at the time, she basically said: “I didn’t sign up for this. Why can’t I have the person I met back?” That really hurt, because I never wanted to cause her pain. But I can’t help being myself. We tried to make it work, but eventually we parted ways, because she was monogamous and I wasn’t. Everything else in the relationship worked, so that was really painful.It’s important to be open and communicate about anyone new coming into the scene. If I’m at a party and I meet someone I want to bring home, I text Anita, who I have a romantic and sexual relationship with, and let her know. And my secret tool is Google Calendar. If I’m on a date and Anita wants to hang out, she can just check my calendar for the next available slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8752e683f22b55c42b6b8059cdf9204518f0bfab/64_0_1913_1148/master/1913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad09aeced02899812a61b0ec6d6259ac","title":"bbc two first full rebrand 25 years","story":"Channel also working with Black Mirror writer Charlie Brooker to develop new showsBBC Two is being completely rebranded for the first time in more than 25 years as the channel looks to reinvent itself in the face of threats from streaming services such as Netflix.The channel’s controller, Patrick Holland, also confirmed BBC Two was working with the Black Mirror creator, Charlie Brooker, to develop new programmes, and revealed Eva Green, Eve Hewson, and Marton Csokas would star in a big-budget adaptation of Eleanor Catton’s Booker prize-winning novel The Luminaries.Holland said traditional television channels still had enormous influence and he could offer a “curated channel in an age where you’ve got all of this choice”. But with the average age of a BBC Two viewer now in their 60s, the channel was facing up to the need to reach a younger audience, he said.The BBC is facing growing pressure from streaming services that are able to outspend it, with the director general, Tony Hall, saying the corporation needed more cash to maintain the current quality of programmes.BBC Two has already refocused its budget towards its primetime output but Holland said his channel’s ability to broadcast to millions of people on any given evening meant it could still set the tone of the national debate. “Netflix cannot do that, Amazon cannot do that. An ongoing schedule gives you an ongoing dialogue with the audience. I wouldn’t swap that for anything.”As part of the revamp, BBC Two will on Thursday drop its on-screen identity based around physical representations of the number two, which it has used in various forms since the early 90s. This will be replaced by a series of colourful visualisations based on a simple curve, which the controller said represented the channel’s “constant evolution, constant eclecticism, constant sense of quality”. It is also easier to rework and cheaper to create than the old branding.Holland said Brooker, whose Black Mirror series recently won an Emmy, was working on new projects. “He’s still working for us. There are things cooking. They haven’t finished cooking yet. They’re still in development,” he said.Other programmes heading to the channel include Riz Ahmed’s Englistan, which will tell the story of three generations of a British Pakistani family the “quite pricey” drama MotherFatherSon starring Richard Gere and a new documentary series charting the rise of Syria’s ruling Assad family.The controller said he was no longer interested in commissioning celebrity-fronted documentaries, which have clogged up schedules for years. “That sense of being told things by presenters in a traditional way is something we’ve moved on from. When you’re immersed in the story and able to make some connections yourself, it’s more grownup television and more emotionally engaging.”He also said contestants on University Challenge needed to be aware of the risk of social media abuse before going on the BBC Two quiz show. “The most important aspect of duty of care is talking through all the things that could happen and then it’s their choice whether they want to consent.”As part of the rebrand Holland is looking to work with Esme Wren, the editor of Newsnight, to “reinvigorate” the current affairs programme and make sure it fits better with the rest of the BBC Two schedule, such as by theming discussions around documentaries.“My role on BBC Two is to try and make the channel as engaged with the modern world, to make it engaged in the big questions of our time, but to do it in a way that brings extraordinary storytelling to the fore,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a8bb4e47b763a4dec9c5c66cff615150987ac4/889_663_2902_1741/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5e9c826476300d0af2618b3ef43046f","title":"halestorm review sheffield academy lzzy hale rock pop","story":"Sheffield AcademyThe Pennsylvanian rockers veer from melody to industrial pummelling – all topped with Lzzy Hale’s lung-collapsing vocalsPop music and hard rock may seem like mortal enemies, but from the opening guitar thunder and soaring melodic chorus of Black Vultures it’s clear that the Grammy-winning Pennsylvanian four-piece Halestorm can bring them together.The band exist happily in this middle ground, in fact, merging the clatter and smack of heavy riffs with sugary choruses, all helped along by Lzzy Hale’s seemingly endless vocal range. Tracks such as I Am the Fire and Vicious perfectly exemplify this fusion – the latter opening with a crunchy industrially charged thump reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails before bursting into a singalong chorus.There are moments of showmanship via an elongated drum solo from brother Arejay Hale, and Lzzy Hale sometimes sings a cappella, allowing her voice to detonate as she shifts from almost Motown-esque melodic grace to gutsy, growling screams. During these moments it becomes clear how much the band is in service to her, moving around her dynamic presence as she spits out her potent vocal and guitar lines.On the closing and fiery Killing Ourselves to Live, a solo-loaded eruption of guitars, pummelling drums and lung-collapsing vocals collide, although the returning encore of love song The Silence, which she performs acoustically while perched at the end of the stage, is a little soppy.Towards the end of 90 minutes, the template begins to feel a little repetitive, but just as it does, Lzzy Hale once again unleashes a room-shaking screech during the intro to I Miss the Misery that powerfully reaffirms the fact that’s you can be a pop star and a metalhead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da20fba01fbe2655e56db5e522b2dc51e7fd3f3d/0_240_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e40279fd49817f9605baed742de8eb69","title":"corbyn vows to end greed is good capitalism in uk","story":"In conference speech Labour leader to lay out plans to change direction of economyJeremy Corbyn will on Wednesday attack the “greed-is-good” capitalism that he claims has resulted in large swaths of the UK being left behind, promising a raft of new policies including a “green jobs revolution” that will create 400,000 new positions.The Labour leader will attempt to reset the theme of the Labour conference which has so far been dominated by deep isions over its Brexit stance and return to his core argument about the failure of the broken economic system.Corbyn will use his main conference speech to set out his plans to change the direction of the economy, following a week in which his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, laid out a series of redistributive policies.The Labour leader will say: “Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.””But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.“People in this country know – they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn’t working any more. That’s why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.”Corbyn will announce plans for a rollout of green technologies including 13,500 onshore and offshore wind turbines, solar panels on thousands of roofs and wide-scale home insulation.A green energy report published by the party on Wednesday will hint at an expansion of other renewable technologies to come, including tidal power, hydrogen and controversially, nuclear, which would help meet tough climate change targets.He is expected to say: “There is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example. Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.The move is designed to be a big offer from the party to help regenerate so-called left behind towns. Many of them are traditionally Labour but leave-backing seats where the party went backwards in support at the last general election.Following a fraught summer dominated by rows over antisemitism, a Labour spokesman played down expectations that Corbyn would apologise directly to the Jewish community in his speech, suggesting that he had already done so.Corbyn will instead concentrate on his plans to reform capitalism, which have so far been fronted by McDonnell, and include policies to tackle high pay and excessive corporate bonuses.However, Labour aides did not expand on how Corbyn would have dealt with the financial crisis differently, insisting that he believed the last Labour government had done all that it could, and that it was the system that had been at fault.The promised investment in green technologies would be paid for from Labour’s £250bn national transformation fund, announced at the last general election, with the home insulation programme alone costing £12.8bn through a variety of subsidies.The plans would involve a dramatic sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms by 2030, with 7,500 turbines powering 12m homes and creating 120,000 jobs, including in the north-east and Humber.There would be 6,000 more turbines onshore, powering 5m homes and creating 60,000 jobs, an ambitious target given the scale of opposition to many existing windfarms.Labour would also invest in solar panels, reversing Tory cuts to power 2.5m homes and create 70,000 jobs. It would insulate homes to high energy efficient standards, creating a 160,000 army of energy assessors, engineers, technicians.The announcement is reminiscent of a pledge from Gordon Brown in 2009 for a “green revolution” which the then prime minister said would create 400,000 jobs over eight years.Among the other policy announcements in the speech are details of a plan to extend the government’s 30 hours of free childcare scheme to the parents of all two-, three- and four-year-olds, which would benefit more than a million children.Families on the lowest incomes would be eligible for additional subsidised hours on top of the 30 hours, which would be free for them and cost no more than £4 per hour for those on the highest incomes, with a sliding scale in between.Corbyn will also pledge to increase average early years funding rates to help the many childcare providers that are struggling – some have even closed – as a result of the 30-hour policy, which they argue is not properly funded.The childcare system would be simplified for parents with the launch of a national childcare online access portal, which would replace the existing complicated mix of vouchers and credits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84a466ef10aa188be37a161e5034b1a81f85775/0_47_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f841c0dda34e80a3f0bb76f16f528b","title":"no deal brexit better than canada style deal theresa may","story":"Prime minister says basic trade deal touted by hardline Tories would risk breakup of UKA no-deal Brexit would be better for the UK than any Canada-style free trade agreement allowed by the EU, Theresa May has argued as she arrived at a United Nations summit determined to regain control of the narrative after some bruising recent days for her own Chequers proposal.At the start of a two-day trip to New York, the prime minister knocked down the possibility of a more basic free trade deal with the EU touted by more hardline Brexiters in her Conservative party, saying it could prompt the disintegration of the UK.May – who criticised Labour’s Brexit plans as “not in the national interest” – also robustly defended her aim for continued alignment with EU standards in areas such as livestock and agriculture, saying the UK would want to maintain these anyway, and that they should not be a barrier to outside trading plans.“If having those EU regulations stopped good trade deals, how come the EU has done trade deals with countries around the rest of the world?” May said, a comment likely to raise some eyebrows among some strongly pro-Brexit Tory MPs.On Monday a series of hardline Tories, including the former Brexit secretary David Davis, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, endorsed a Canada-style free trade alternative to Brexit, arguing it was the only way the UK could reap the full benefits of departure.Speaking to reporters on her flight to the UN’s general assembly, where she will meet Donald Trump and the Iranian and Turkish presidents among other assembled leaders, May said the Brexiters’ plan would necessitate a hard Irish border and thus invoke the EU’s so-called backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland within elements of the customs union and single market, effectively drawing a customs border in the Irish Sea.A no-deal departure would be preferable, she said: “First of all, I’ve always said no deal is better than a bad deal. I think a bad deal will be a deal, for example, that broke up the United Kingdom. We want to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom.“What we’ve put on the table is a good deal. It’s a deal that retains the unity of the United Kingdom, our constitutional integrity. It’s a deal which provides for no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, protects jobs and enables us to have a good trade relationship with Europe and good trade relationships with the rest of the world.”At an informal EU summit in Salzburg last week, May had hoped to receive supportive words for her Chequers plan before what is expected to be a bruising Conservative party conference starting on Sunday. Instead, the prime minister was told that Brussels still had significant and fundamental problems with the plan.Asked whether she continued to face the impasse outlined in her robust statement at Downing Street the day after the summit, May said subsequent words from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had showed signs of progress.“I think what he has clarified is that there is hope and expectation for a deal on the side of the European Union, and of course there are aspects of the Chequers proposal which they’re comfortable with,” she said.There was, however, more to be done, May said: “I believe it would work not just for us but for the EU. But if they have concerns they need to detail those concerns to us, and if they have counter-proposals let’s hear the counter-proposals, and then we can discuss those and take it forward.”Asked about Labour’s ideas for Brexit that emerged from its conference this week, May condemned the expectation that the party’s MPs will vote against her final deal.“From the Labour party’s point of view they will oppose any deal I bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK, and they will accept any deal Europe gives, regardless of how bad it is for the UK,” she said. “That’s not in the national interest. What we’re doing is in the national interest.”May, who arrived in New York on Tuesday lunchtime local time, was scheduled to meet the presidents of Iran, Turkey and France – Hassan Rouhani, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Emmanuel Macron – and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.On Wednesday May will meet Trump, address the general assembly, and discuss Brexit and trade with business leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baef29ceaea173bbf5a76a3c189c3b234485b966/0_1727_4585_2750/master/4585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e7f1935b18b1340183e8fea9e83877","title":"labour mps call for general strike to topple tories rejected laura smith","story":"Two senior members of the shadow cabinet have rejected a call from a fellow Labour MP for a general strike to force the government to call a general election.To enthusiastic cheers from delegates at a Labour conference fringe event, Laura Smith, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said: “Comrades, we must topple this cruel and callous Tory government as soon as we can.But the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said a general strike was not Labour party policy, and the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the idea was “not particularly helpful”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Long-Bailey put Smith’s call down to over-exuberance. “Laura is an absolutely amazing MP. She’s so full of energy and enthusiasm but we are certainly not advocating general strikes,” she said.Watson told the programme: “I’m sure she got a bit carried away with herself.” He said the history of the 1926 general strike showed it was an “absolute failure for the working class”, pointing out that the prime minister of the day, Stanley Baldwin, survived the action. “So it didn’t work on its own terms,” Watson said.Long-Bailey also said the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, did not intend to attack previous Labour governments in his speech to the conference later on Wednesday. Corbyn will remind delegates of the devastating consequences of the financial crash of 2008. He will say: “Instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.”Long-Bailey claimed this was not a criticism of the former Labour prime minster Gordon Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling.She said: “It was a situation that the then Labour government was forced into in order to make sure our economy stayed afloat. They were required to step in and address the mistakes of financial institutions that unfortunately were operating outside of the norms of moral conduct.”She added: “He’s attacking the capitalist system that was prevalent at that time. We had a number of institutions operating outside the bounds of moral acceptability. Unfortunately, years later, many of our communities are still paying for that. He’s certainly not attacking the Labour party.”Watson said he was “disappointed” by focus group research that suggested Labour under Corbyn was more associated with quinoa than with a pie and pint.Watson said most of his friends didn’t know how to pronounce quinoa. “And it is not on my new diet list, so I was very disappointed when I read that, because I’m definitely a meat and two veg man.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85db7feab7dfea5a8ed3e1480f7ea8f562deeada/0_261_5194_3117/master/5194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16aa44b76c9cf3aaa78bec3774023375","title":"corbyn speech labour conference set to address labour conference as party rejects mps call for general strike politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the final day of the Labour conference in Liverpool, including Jeremy Corbyn’s keynote speechCorbyn talks about Labour’s success.This year we mark the centenary of the Representation of the People Act, which saw eight million women getting the vote for the first time, along with five and a half million working class men.We now have more women members of the Labour Party than the entire membership, male and female, of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties put together.He praises Jennie Formby, the new general secretary, saying “her integrity and her determination are real assets for our party.”Corbyn is now starting.Corbyn says thank you.

But the union is also frustrated because international windows in July and November from 2020 onwards were the cornerstone of an agreement reached by World Rugby in San Francisco last January.Along with Premiership Rugby (PRL) and the Rugby Players’ Association (RPA), the RFU is close to announcing how the domestic season in England fits into the global calendar as agreed in San Francisco.An RFU spokesperson told the : “We are a bit perplexed at these apparent developments and ideas which we have not been party to. We have worked really hard with our stakeholders PRL and RPA to define the new domestic season and we are working to the principles agreed with World Rugby which we have been assured are still valid.”It is understood the RFU lodged a complaint with World Rugby over Pichot’s comments and received assurances from the global governing body’s chairman Bill Beaumont. Since then details of Pichot’s plans – as well as reported meetings with executives from the New Zealand, South Africa and French unions – have emerged.The RFU expects discussions on the global calendar in Sydney to centre on how commercial revenues from the international game can be increased based on the San Francisco agreement.

An iron or fairway wood off the tee will leave a mid-iron into a green guarded by water and two bunkers.More water is in play to the left of the par-three. Prevailing wind is behind, meaning it is hard to stop the ball on the green. Finding the putting surface on the right is the safest play.Extended in 2004, the first par five is reachable in two with an accurate drive to the left side of the fairway. A large tree and bunker guard each side of the green, although the generous sand trap won’t present many problems for Ryder Cup players.New fairway bunkers mean players will need to produce a long and straight tee shot to set up the uphill approach to an elevated green, which is full of slopes. A long par four and one of the toughest holes on the course.There is potential for welcome respite on this short par four. Three fairway bunkers guard the corner of a short right dogleg and more lies sand in front of a green which narrows at the back but this presents a chance to be aggressive.One of several holes without a bunker, the short sixth is a good birdie opportunity with the biggest difficulty coming in judging the distance of the approach to a green below the level of the fairway. Expect players to use an iron from the tee, followed by a wedge.A dogleg right which features a tee shot played to a blind, elevated section of a two-part fairway, followed by a tricky approach to the long green which starts narrow but widens dramatically. Out of bounds awaits a wild drive to the right.A solitary, albeit deep, bunker guards the front of the large green on this par three, where judging the wind is a common difficulty, as is keeping the ball on a seriously sloping green from a tee shot requiring a long iron.Unlike the 3rd, reaching this par five in two will be impossible for all-but the longest hitters in the event. Everything to the right of the green means trouble, meaning lay-ups and accurate wedge shots will be needed by many.Another short par four but a testing one owing to its uphill nature and the re-appearance of a water hazard, this time on the left. Thick rough protects the right. Short irons from the tee will be common.A hole which underwent major changes in 2016, with the water hazard guarding the front of the green extended and two new bunkers added at the back. One of Le Golf National’s less inspiring holes.A dogleg right with a long bunker down the left of the fairway and a shorter one to the right making for a difficult tee shot. The Ryder Cup’s website describes the green as “large (and) bumpy” so par could well be a winning score.Another dogleg right but this time water is the main hazard, both right of the fairway and in front of the green. A firm fairway also means balls can easily fly into deep rough. Oak trees protect the green. All in all a tough prospect.The last of the holes extended in 2004, the 14th has a huge bunker defending the front and left-hand side of a two-tier green which slopes away from the players at the back. Wide from the tee, meaning two to the green is feasible.The start of what could prove one of the most exciting and daunting closing Ryder Cup stretches. The 15th has water running down the right side of the hole and in front of the green, making accuracy paramount. A firm green offers little margin for error. Four is a fine score.Water protects the right-hand side of this hole, with any players bailing out to the left likely to be faced with a tricky downhill chip, a bunker shot or putt back towards the hazard.There are no bunkers or water hazards on the 17th, but the uphill tee shot and a green which slopes from right to left means par is far from guaranteed. Could reasonably be regarded as a par five. Hitting the fairway from the tee is vital.An exciting closing hole, with water all the way down the left – and in front of the green – plus pot bunkers on the right of the fairway. Used to be a par five before regrading. Strategy from the tee is imperative, if only to ease the sense of fear around the approach shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef58acd8984e5e2506660d61f5e6bbafd2035b49/0_142_2107_1264/master/2107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=707426da04539a2514314e49a754359b","title":"lance armstrong biggest comeback sport disgraced","story":"You’ve got to hand it to Lance Armstrong – he’s a fighter.

Specifically, his distaste at the candidacy of David Millar, a man who was once his teammate but who committed the solecism of calling on him to come clean back when he was still getting away with it.You’d think their shared life experiences might have earned Millar a little empathy. But no. Armstrong has no time for his former brother-in-arms, even when those arms all had artificially high blood counts. Armstrong was outraged that Millar had the audacity to lobby for a role in the sport he contaminated. “Millar is probably the last person that would come to mind for this role,” said Armstrong. It’s charmingly endearing, isn’t it, to know that he can’t think of anyone who might be a worse candidate.Armstrong’s objections are that Millar will not provide the riders with the protection and the strong voice they deserve. Armstrong was, of course, known to be passionate about the welfare of the peloton when he was competing. Although it is perhaps a sign of how much he has grown that giving them a say has worked its way so far up his list of priorities. He wasn’t quite so keen for his colleagues or employees to be heard when they were on the brink of exposing him.But the world today is a very different one from that dark time, back in 2012, when that giant conspiracy was determined to dirty his halo. Happily, these days it is possible to rewrite and even simply ignore the unfortunate things one has said and done in the past. In fact, Armstrong’s understanding of how malleable truth can be is surely only to his long-term credit in today’s public sphere.In the era of our post-truth politics, brass neck and sheer gall are precious commodities. So perhaps when he was accusing Floyd Landis of being “desperate for attention and money”, calling his masseuse an alcoholic whore and deriding the investigation against him as an “unconstitutional witch hunt”, he was just ahead of his time.It can be no coincidence that, on the day that Armstrong finally gave up his legal defence, there was one voice warning him against it. “I never thought he was a quitter,” tweeted Donald Trump. “He should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.”Let us hope it brings President Trump joy to know that he was mistaken. That, six years after Armstrong’s lifelong ban from the sport he had disgraced, the man who determinedly cheated, lied and bullied his way to an almost successful cover-up is back in our lives with a top-10 podcast.It was, Armstrong told his listeners in July, “super humbling” to be this popular again. “For me it was really humbling that it was almost a validation. I mean you had a show that had five million downloads in three weeks,” he added, humbly. As his own website asks: “Who believes that the most meaningful revelations emerge at the far edge of your limits – that there are flashes of self-truth in moments of suffering?” We du.Whether Armstrong has actually attained such enlightenment, only he and his buddy Oprah may ever know. It would certainly be easier to enjoy his rebranding and his range of T-shirt logos – “Sūffer”, “Soūl” and “Get Oūt” – if the contrition he offered for his past actions felt less self-absorbed. Take his recent appearance on the Freakonomics podcast, in which the interviewer congratulated him on how far he had come. And it was true, Armstrong did say he understood why people hated him and that “people had suffered this tremendous sense of betrayal”, which is almost but not quite the same thing as saying you feel ashamed that you betrayed them.He pointed out that he had tried to make amends to those he’d wronged. “This thing’s cost me $111m,” he said. “Everybody’s been paid back.” He also, however, said he wouldn’t change a thing and complained he had been treated unfairly compared to Alex Rodriguez, who was allowed to return to baseball after his drugs scandal.Which brings us back to Millar. Armstrong’s ongoing gripe at the cycling authorities is how the big fish caught in the dopers’ net were made examples of while the small fry were “given complete passes”.One can’t help speculating that Millar’s own rehabilitation is part of the “hypocritical and unfair” situation Armstrong now discerns. Hypocrisy? Unfairness? How very dare they. Armstrong’s own return to the cycling world is surely a matter of earnest, selfless rehabilitation, a precursor to a second act that will win us all over again.As the man himself says, this thing’s cost him enough. He’s had to pass up Dancing with the Stars every year just to look sorry. Perhaps it’s time he headed to the jungle for I’m a Celebrity. Now that’s what I call rehabilitation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/badbce489f44663005ba08494fbdbf0dd74ad82f/0_171_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902d7f10097ccee44b1c95d8140fbddb","title":"backpackers guide to china one month itinerary shanghai national parks","story":"The country’s epic scale adds further adventure to this route, which takes in historic villages, national parks and megacities while staying in budget accommodationChina’s vast size and expensive visas, coupled with the perceived difficulties of travelling there, means much of the country remains relatively unexplored by international visitors. Thanks to this though, with a little determination and time, it’s possible to wind up in places where locals will have rarely seen a foreign face, such as Cangpo village in Zheijang’s verdant bamboo-covered landscapes. Even in the big cities you will come across domestic tourists for whom foreigners are a novelty.In Beijing, tick off the must-see sights of the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, and spend a few surreal minutes walking past the embalmed body of Mao Zedong in his mausoleum. Wander the narrow hutongs (alleyways) of the Wudaoying and Fangjia neighbourhoods, stumbling across hidden bars and restaurants. Visit the Simatai section of the Great Wall for fewer crowds, dizzying climbs and stunning views.From Beijing, take the train to Xi’an (5-6 hours) or go via the ancient walled city of Pingyao (train, around 4 hours) and stay at Pingyao Jiaxin Guesthouse, an old courtyard building with traditional kang-heated beds (doubles from £11). Xi’an’s Terracotta Warriors are, quite simply, among the great archaeological wonders of the world. After jostling the crowds there, fuel up on some of China’s best food at the Muslim Quarter market.From Xi’an take the train to Lanzhou (2-3 hours), a massive, industrial city home to the irresistible Lanzhou beef noodle soup – eat it for breakfast like the locals. Plan a long day trip to see the remote Buddhist sculptures at the Bingling Temple Grottoes, accessed by a speedboat across a vast lake.If time allows, travel to Chengdu by bus (consult timetables locally) via Xiahe monastery town (staying at the nearby Nirvana Hotel, dorm bed from £7) or visit the Jiuzhaigou or Huanglong national parks for high-altitude hiking past dazzlingly blue natural pools. Alternatively, take an overnight train (around 11 hours) or fly (around 1½ hours).Enjoy Chengdu’s teahouse culture at one of the hundreds across the city – keep a lookout for locals nursing hot flasks of boiling water and playing mahjong. Pay the pandas a visit at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding – you can even sign up to be a keeper for a day (from £40pp). And be sure to spend a day visiting the Leshan Giant Buddha, the largest stone Buddha sculpture in the world.From Xiamen, take the train to Shanghai (from £37, fastest train 5 hours). If time allows, stop off at the Wuyi mountain range to explore south-east China’s tea culture and hike through Unesco world heritage-listed scenery.China is massive and getting anywhere will probably take much longer than anticipated, and it gets more time-consuming the further west you go. The comfortable high-speed trains can be a fast way to cover distances (see our guide to travelling by train in China), while the older long-distance sleeper trains make for an adventure. While quicker than trains, domestic flights can be expensive and plagued by delays. Coaches are a good option in places with no railway stations. In towns and cities, public transport is cheap, starting from around 10p for bus and metro journeys.Youth hostels and guesthouses outside of the major cities are usually extremely cheap – just a few pounds for a bed in a dormitory. According to Hostelworld, the average price of a hostel bed is £10 in major cities and £6 in other areas, though breakfast isn’t always included. If you don’t mind haggling, it’s possible to negotiate a discounted walk-in price, especially outside the Chinese holidays. Expect firmer mattresses than you may be used to as Chinese people, especially the older generation, have a preference for hard beds.Many guesthouses in more rural areas are run by families, often in the family home. These can be a wonderful way to meet local people, enjoy homemade food and stay in traditional-style buildings. Wherever you stay, however, make sure that the hotel is permitted to take foreign guests: in remote locations it is against the law for some cheaper places to do so, so there’s a risk of a visit from the local security bureau if they take you in.Inside the Forbidden City. From the outside the enormous palace is impressive but inside there’s little sense of the fascinating and isolated lives its royal inhabitants must have experienced. Plus, it’s a major tourist attraction and the crowds can get boisterous.Almost anywhere outside Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an and Hong Kong but particularly the central western provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai. Here, you can experience Tibetan culture without the hassle of getting a separate entry permit for Tibet.Many Chinese people have a fairly boisterous attitude to etiquette and there’s little the average traveller will do to offend. In restaurants, expect to receive your free glass of water boiling hot even on blisteringly hot days thanks to the belief that cold drinks are harmful.

Head to the busy food market in Xi’an’s Muslim Quarter and get your hands on a greasy, delicious roujiamo. Usually made from delicately spiced pulled pork (or lamb or beef from a Muslim food store) sandwiched in a round pitta-like bun, these “Chinese sandwiches” are a cheap, filling snack. Ingredients and taste vary from place to place, too, so you’ll never tire of sampling local versions.While local food is cheap, major tourist attractions can be expensive (although many give discounts to students and seniors). Budget at least £35pp a day. There’s no tipping so this can help keep costs down.Head to Taiwan to see what mainland China might have been without 60 years of Communist rule. There are flights to Taipei from most major mainland cities popular airlines include Taiwanese carrier China Airlines and Shanghai-based China Eastern. In Taiwan, Mandarin Chinese is used so any words or phrases picked up on the mainland won’t go to waste. You’ll need to brush up on your traditional Chinese characters, though, rather than the simplified version used in mainland China.

It stars a big-time film actor going through a period of emotional turmoil. It deals with a tricky, knotty subject matter that would have been handled much less ornately a decade ago. It found a home on a non-traditional channel after falling through at another network. It has, you sense, been made for me rather than you the sort of series whose best hope comes from critical buzz that translates into awards chatter, bypassing mainstream audiences completely. You could realistically find this show anywhere: on HBO, AMC, Showtime, Netflix or Hulu.But Sorry For Your Loss is on Facebook and, more precisely, its original content channel, Facebook Watch. It has been produced, funded and distributed by Facebook. It’s fair to call this a left turn for the platform.Think of Facebook and you probably think of unusably simplistic cooking videos, or Kickstarter ads for shoes, or faked footage of levitating Chinese cars that my dad will inexplicably insist are real. Even the existing Facebook Watch stable of original shows – primarily consisting of sludgy millennial reality filler including Help Us Get Married, You Kiddin’ Me? and (god help us all) Huda Boss – did nothing to prepare anyone for something as stately and mature as Sorry For Your Loss.They are all right, to some extent. As a show about a young woman dealing with the sudden death of her husband, Sorry For Your Loss is prestige TV with a capital P. It’s full of long, naturalistic takes and flashbacks and a quiet twinkly score that you might find at a particularly creepy day spa. It manages to find both pain and solace in the quotidian minutiae of grief. It lingers on fumbled efforts to console the bereaved, which is ironic for a show on a platform that allows people to do exactly that by clicking on a little blue thumbs-up cartoon. It isn’t exactly a laugh riot, all said.But that doesn’t matter, because so far Sorry For Your Loss has achieved all its goals. It’s being written about in the sort of hifalutin publications that wouldn’t have smacked Huda Boss with a bargepole, and this has helped to announce Facebook Watch as a going concern. It’s a by-the-number move, because new streaming services always punt for acclaim when they’re first trying to find elbow room at the table. Netflix had House of Cards, Amazon had Transparent, Hulu had The Handmaid’s Tale and Facebook has this. If the pattern holds, Olsen will receive an award nomination for Sorry For Your Loss, and this is when Facebook will be formally validated as a broadcaster.However, there might be one thing standing in the show’s way, and that’s the Facebook platform itself. Normally, the streaming playbook involves keeping viewing figures as a closely guarded secret. Nobody knows if 10 thousand people have seen Nanette, for example, or a hundred million. But with Facebook, it’s right there under every post.Still, I’m rooting for Facebook Watch. Sorry For Your Loss might win a few awards or make a handful of year-end best-of lists, but it’s the sort of brave experiment that should be encouraged. Not least because, if it works, I can pitch them my new drama about a cryptically depressed housewife. It’s called U OK Hun. It’s properly miserable. Everyone will hate it.

It betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world.” But the US president Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, addressing an anti-Iran pressure group, said he was “disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed” by the EU plan.“This is one of the of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security,” Pompeo said.Versions of the SPV floated by thinktanks suggest it could underpin a sophisticated barter system that can avoid US Treasury sanctions. For example, Iran could ship crude oil to a French firm, accumulating credit that could then be used to pay an Italian manufacturer for goods shipped the other way, without any funds traversing through Iranian hands or the banking system.A multinational European state-backed financial intermediary would be set up to handle deals with companies interested in Iran transactions and with Iranian counter-parties. Any transactions would not be transparent to the US, and involve euros and sterling rather than dollars.The proposal is additional to a blocking statute passed by the EU in August that theoretically makes EU companies immune from sanctions imposed by the US in pursuit of its Iran policy. In theory, the statute empowers EU firms to seek compensation from US Treasury for trying to impose extra-territorial sanctions in breach of the statute. So far this statute has not been tested in court.Richard Nephew, a former Barack Obama official and author of The Art of Sanctions, expressed scepticism on Twitter, saying that for the SPV to be taken up, European firms – many with either US employees, or US subsidiaries – must still be prepared to take the risk of being sanctioned by the US.Jarrett Blanc, another former Obama staffer for the Iran deal, broadly agreed with Nephew, but was more sympathetic, writing that “the symbolism here is probably Europe’s most important contribution, and it may be sufficient depending on what China, India, Turkey do on oil”. He added: “The payment mechanism move opens the door to a longer-term degradation of US sanctions power.”Either way, Europe needs a solution soon after months of railing against US economic imperialism. The vast majority of European firms are planning to pull out.Trump announced two sets of US secondary sanctions in May, and other sanctions imposed in August cover shipping and insurance. The other more important sanctions – aimed at ending Iranian oil exports, still the heart of the faltering Iranian economy – do not bite until 5 November.The assumption is that many countries like India and Russia will continue to trade with Iran and challenge the US to try to impose sanctions, pointing out that in reality it is the US, by tearing up the agreement and not them, that is in breach of UN resolutions.• This article was amended on 26 September 2018 to correct a misspelling of the last name of Federica Mogherini."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f2a90d4888c577ec2614b9464d952ea998bbe7/0_75_2216_1330/master/2216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7aa6d0d25ac95d6247b74ed6327f2c4","title":"eu steps up no deal brexit preparations as labour alarms capitals","story":"Fears in Europe that party’s goal of unseating PM could lead to chaos of ‘cliff-edge’ exitThe EU is intensifying its preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid heightened fears in European capitals that Jeremy Corbyn will order his MPs to vote down any deal struck in Brussels, a leaked document reveals.Labour’s stated goal to reject Theresa May’s deal in order to spark a general election has provoked a rush of activity in Brussels, where the party’s plans are regarded as one of the substantial risks to the negotiations.Shortly after Corbyn ends his leader’s speech at the Labour party conference, one of the European commission’s most senior officials is to address EU ambassadors on contingency planning in the event of a breakdown in talks, or the likely failure of the UK parliament to ratify any agreement struck in Brussels.A leaked document circulated among ambassadors in Brussels before Wednesday’s meeting warns of the prospect of Labour combining with rebel Tory MPs to kill off a deal.It says: “Preparedness work has to intensify in the months ahead at national as well as EU level, as uncertainty remains about the outcome of the negotiations and the ratification of a possible deal.”Corbyn has confirmed that unless the agreement struck in Brussels can deliver “exactly the same benefits” as membership of the single market and the customs union, Labour would vote it down “in order to send the government – if it is still in office – straight back to the negotiating table”.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said on Wednesday that it would take a miracle for Labour to support a deal brought back by May.Corbyn is expected in Brussels on Thursday to meet the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to explain his position. But there is growing concern that Labour’s determination to unseat May could instead propel UK into a “cliff-edge” Brexit, throwing the continent into chaos.On Tuesday Barnier, gave a downbeat analysis of the state of the negotiations during a private meeting with MEPs.Afterwards, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, Philippe Lamberts, told the : “I have zero trust in Labour, I am afraid to say. The Labour position is not to do with principles, but about tactical considerations. It is all about getting the government out of power whatever the cost.”According to the leaked document the reality of a no-deal Brexit has also prompted the EU’s member states to go over the head of the European commission and assert their right to take a “political choices” on potential mini-deals with the UK to avoid the worst repercussions of such a scenario, including the grounding of flights between Britain and the EU.The document says: “Contingency measures can only be triggered at a certain stage, and some political choices, eg as regards to the extent to which these measures should mitigate the effect of a disorderly withdrawal, will have to be made before the commission can provide possible answers.”Earlier this month, Barnier reprimanded the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, after it emerged that the UK government had written to EU capitals to seek bilateral deals on transport, including aviation and haulage.France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has claimed the EU has higher considerations than the UK’s economic health to deal with and it would be “suicidal” for the bloc to soften its stance in relation to May’s Chequers proposals for the future relationship.“I’m sorry to say it so callously: there is something more important for us than the future of the UK, and that’s the future of the EU,” he said. “Any decision that would give European citizens the feeling you can exit the EU and keep all the advantages would be suicidal, and we won’t make that decision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2520c0419d89c5184f67abf24b95ad0ac94ac589/1702_62_2529_1518/master/2529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e180a86cd6692d783ba4a1e10be99810","title":"former french pm manuel valls to run for barcelona mayor","story":"Valls was born in city while his parents were on holiday but has never lived thereThe former French prime minister Manuel Valls has formally announced his candidacy for mayor of Barcelona, joining a rare club of politicians who have run for office in two countries.Valls said he wanted to lead a coalition focused on “poverty, unemployment, racism and social injustice” rather than the vexed issue of Catalan independence.Speaking in Catalan, Spanish and French to a packed meeting in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, the former socialist, who has since shifted to the right, said: “Barcelona deserves to be governed thinking about the city and not other projects that have nothing to do with the city itself.”He said Barcelona should be “an antidote against populism” and “a meeting point and a space of co-existence”. He said he would resign as a French MP to clear the way for his run.The leader of the centre-right Citizens party, Albert Rivera, welcomed his candidacy, tweeting: “There is no one better to recover Barcelona’s prestige and defeat separatism and populism at the ballot box.”Despite Valls’ words, the mayoral campaign is likely to serve as a proxy battle in the wider independence war. His main rival will be the incumbent, Ada Colau, who has tried to remain above the independence fray and has been criticised over crime levels and the proliferation of street vendors.Barcelona remains the secessionists’ weakest link and a failure to win it would undermine their claim to represent the majority of Catalans. More than half the city’s inhabitants were either born outside Catalonia and retain strong links with the rest of Spain or are immigrants from other countries.Valls, 56, who was born in Barcelona while his parents were on holiday but has never lived there, was at pains to assert his close ties to the city, with numerous references to his Catalan father, the artist Xavier Valls, and childhood holidays spent in the city.In a dig at Colau, Valls vowed to clean up the city, which he claimed had descended into lawlessness.Colau, whose Barcelona en Comú platform claimed a surprise victory in 2015, will be standing for re-election. For most of the past four years she has had the highest approval ratings of any mayor in the city’s history, but she has few friends in the media or among the secessionists and faces a tough campaign.However, Valls’ tenuous connection to the city will make him an easy target for Colau, who has deep roots in Barcelona’s tradition of militant, communitarian politics.As well Colau, Valls will probably be up against Ernest Maragall, the likely mayoral candidate for the pro-independence Republican Left, whose leader, Oriol Junqueras, is among the Catalan leaders awaiting trial for their part in last October’s illegal declaration of independence.Valls’ speech on Tuesday suggested he was aware of the need to concentrate on local issues rather than basing his run on anti-independence sentiments.Maragall, whose brother Pasqual was Barcelona mayor from 1982 to 1997 and oversaw the successful 1992 Olympic bid, has warned Valls against campaigning on an anti-independence platform, saying the people of the city would not tolerate being used as part of a national issue.“I would be ill at ease if the only campaign debate was about whether or not Barcelona contributes to the independence of Catalonia,” he told reporters in Madrid on Monday. “Barcelona is the real debate.”Maragall, who is the Catalan government’s foreign minister, also professed surprise that someone who had never lived in the city should be a candidate.“But that’s fine,” he said. “We’ll see how he gets on when it comes to Barcelona’s society, culture and institutions. At the moment he seems tied to interests and funding that have nothing to do with Barcelona. Mr Valls seems to want to buy Barcelona in that classic, horrible political strategy you see in rightwingers around the world.”Nevertheless, Valls could yet prove an attractive alternative for the many conservative Catalans who feel they have been dragged out of their depth as secessionists have wrested the leadership of their party from its traditionally moderate, if nationalist leaders.The former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams won Belfast West in 1983 but refused to take up his seat in Westminster. He served as the constituency’s MP from 1997 to 2011, when he resigned to contest the Louth constituency in that year’s Irish general election. He won and has sat in the Dáil for the past seven years.After serving as president of Georgia for nine years, Mikheil Saakashvili was appointed governor of Odessa by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, in May 2015. He was in post for 18 months before quitting and launching a scathing attack on Poroshenko. The president responded by stripping Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship while the Georgian-born politician was in the US.Going back a little further, the Greek diplomat Count Ioannis Kapodistrias served as imperial Russia’s foreign minister before becoming the first governor of his homeland in 1828 after its independence from the Ottoman empire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95415d1f54346c57e9f537a8721ef6fa26b7e542/0_0_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91eabcf8ed27826713ea6a49920df935","title":"man removed from indian plane after entering cockpit to charge phone","story":"A man was removed from an IndiGo flight from Mumbai to Kolkata and handed over to police, though later releasedA passenger has been taken off an Indian domestic flight after trying to enter the cockpit to charge his phone.The man, who some Indian media reports said was intoxicated, tried to enter the cockpit while the plane prepared to take off for Kolkata from the western city of Mumbai.“While an IndiGo aircraft was on the ground, an unruly passenger tried to enter the cockpit stating that his mobile needs to be charged,” a statement from the airline said.He was removed from the aircraft and handed over to police “on grounds of a security violation”, IndiGo said.Police questioned the man but released him soon after.It is the second such incident this week. On Monday a passenger aboard a flight from Delhi to the Bihar state capital Patna was spotted trying to open the rear door of the aircraft while it was in mid-air. Another passenger raised the alarm and the man was stopped by the crew. He was handed over to police in Patna.While a sign of India’s growing prosperity, carriers say the influx of first-time flyers also throws up new challenges. This year one airline, Air Asia India, said it was producing a how-to video for new customers explaining essential aspects of air travel, from the need to show up on time to instructions on how to use an onboard toilet.Indian flight attendants have frequently written in local media about the entitlement mentality of wealthy passengers in particular. “They think they can get away with anything,” attendant Sanchita Nanda wrote in The Print. “If a male passenger likes your face, he keeps ringing the call-bell, or if you give him a cup, he tries to touch your hand first.”Reports of sexual harassment of attendants and other passengers have also become more common, though the problem is not uniquely Indian. The FBI said in April it had received 63 reports of sexual assault aboard aircraft in the United States in 2017.Last week, more than 30 passengers were admitted to hospital suffering nose bleeds, headaches and ear pain after crew aboard a flight from Jaipur forgot to pressurise the cabin.Earlier this year, Jet Airways suspended two pilots for five years after a male pilot slapped his female co-pilot during a flight to Mumbai. She reportedly stormed out of the cockpit and the male pilot eventually left to find her, leaving the plane on auto-pilot.A Qatar Airways flight made an emergency landing in the south Indian city of Chennai last year, after a woman used her sleeping husband’s thumb to unlock his phone, where she discovered evidence he was cheating on her.She reportedly began attacking her husband and cabin crew were unable to restore order, forcing the emergency stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3f4c2b03e9a1b83bb392c38f1c2fda53ec5011/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=268feb039839766cee9ceed6a85fbd09","title":"uk pothole epidemic helps fuel surge in callouts the aa","story":"Effects from both extreme cold and hot weather on roads dents company profitsThe AA has said a “pothole epidemic” caused by the “beast from the east” contributed to the highest number of vehicle breakdown callouts in 15 years.“Against this backdrop, I am extremely proud of our achievements and to be reporting results in line with our guidance as we continue to build resilience throughout the business.”The AA, famous for its distinctive yellow livery, was formed by a group of motoring enthusiasts in 1905 and provides roadside help through personal membership and business partnerships as well as motor insurance policies.It has been investing heavily in its roadside business to increase the number of company-owned patrols and improve its mobile-app based services for car breakdowns under Breakwell, who took over the top job at the century-old firm last year.Breakwell set out the strategy in February as the company announced plans to pay lower idends and forecast lower core profit for 2019.The company reported trading earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of £161m for the six-month period, down from £193m reported a year earlier.The AA reaffirmed its full-year Ebitda expectations of between £335m and £345m."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"From science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryPersonal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interviewMy career path: Sybil Smyth is a trainee at Deloitte\u0026rsquos tax departmentMy career path: Stephen McGrath works for the property department at Lidl"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"From science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryProposal to allow children make communion at regular mass aimed to encourage churchgoingMP says border posts would be a physical manifestation of separationMy career path: Sybil Smyth is a trainee at Deloitte\u0026rsquos tax departmentNo injuries as emergency services called to blaze at The Avenue on Tuesday nightIssue brought into focus by recent Jobstown and Belfast trialsUnsafe staffing levels and overcrowding led to demonstration at Connolly Hospital, protester explainsMany school staff not trained to deal with challenging behaviour, say campaignersGarda claims candidates with lower interview scores were selected over himPay Commission finding that nurse retention is not an issue is \u0026lsquoinaccurate\u0026rsquo, says nurses\u0026rsquo groupA very long lead-in time to getting \u0026lsquoa hole in the ground\u0026rsquo, says council officialPersonal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersThere have been no reports of injuries as of yet, but fire services remain at the sceneSinn F\u0026eacutein motion of no confidence in Eoghan Murphy defeated 59 votes to 49Diarmuid Martin claims removing church for education entirely would damage pluralismMinister had seemed to accept amendments to controversial Bill aimed at reducing consumptionWexford TD claims Government \u0026lsquowedded\u0026rsquo to policy that housing market will fix itselfChildren being \u0026lsquoleft at side of the road\u0026rsquo due to poor handling of transport scheme \u0026ndash TDs saySmartphone battery, imaging, babies\u0026rsquo vaccine and skin-ageing among latest strides"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

It\u0027s a natural thing to use.He said of designing his first stained glass window: I learnt something about glass. It was a challenge.The artist said of Westminster Abbey: I know this is a historic place and I know it\u0027s going to last.Asked whether the Queen has seen the finished work, he said: Not yet but I hope she\u0027ll like it. I\u0027m sure she will.Westminster Abbey said that the result reflects the Queen as a countrywoman and her widespread delight in, and yearning for, the countryside.The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said: I\u0027m excited by it.I think there\u0027s absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and different.Some of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautiful, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.He added: It\u0027s going to be here until the end. Who knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future.Hockney, 81, is one of Britain\u0027s most-loved artists and famous for his Yorkshire landscapes and paintings of Californian life.Barley Studio, a stained glass studio based in York, created the window using traditional techniques.Beluga whale resurfaces in River Thames: Rare marine mammal spotted near Gravesend amid fears for safetyJeremy Corbyn delivers keynote speech after being warned Labour\u0026#39s trust with Jewish community is \u0026#39severed\u0026#39 - latest newsDivorce rates fall to lowest levels since 1973 due to people getting married later in lifeEU holds emergency meeting amid fears Labour would vote down Brexit dealComment: By taking Canada off the table, Theresa May leaves us with Chequers or bustUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?How popular is Donald Trump?

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m.

The affordable fashion brand, known for its handbag range,\u0026nbspwill change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal has closed, the firm said.John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings, said the deal was “an important milestone for our group”. “For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage. Versace fans rebel against the brand’s rumoured sale to Michael KorsWe are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,” he said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to over $2bn in revenues. We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.”Confirmation of the sale comes after fans called on Versace to put a stop to the sale. The Italian luxury brand was founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago. After Mr Versace was murdered in 1997, his family took over the company. The Versace family currently have an 80 per cent stake in the company, while the remaining 20 per cent is held by private equity group Blackstone, which bought into the firm in 2014, with plans to list it on the stock market.However, Blackstone is reported to have found the investment disappointing, and abandoned its plans for a float some time ago.Versace to stop using fur in its collectionsMost people are pronouncing Versace wrongAmerican Crime Story revives fascination in Versace\u0027s deathDonatella Versace, the group’s vice president and chief designer, said: “This is a very exciting moment for Versace. It has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra. I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. “Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of ersity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential.”Ms Versace added: “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.“Santo, Allegra and I will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. This demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”The purchase of Versace is the second major deal announced by Michael Kors in the last 18 months - the company bought shoe designer Jimmy Choo for £921m last year.

That tool logs what apps and activities people do with their phone, and presents it all in one easy to use chart.The phone will log whether people are spending all their time on social media, for instance. And it also measures other data like how many notifications arrive and how often owners pick up their phones.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed. But if not it can be found by heading into the Settings app, scrolling down to Screen Time, and following the instructions that are found there.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He shared a conversation between himself and Snapchat’s head of partnerships, for instance, in which he agreed with West’s criticism of those posts.\u0026nbspAn\u0026nbspearlier Instagram post from West appeared to show a conversation with Jack Dorsey, the CEO and one of the founders of Twitter. In that post, Mr Dorsey appeared to suggest that he was considering taking on West’s criticisms, and that Twitter could downplay the likes and follower counts that have become such a central part of the network.Another post on West’s Instagram included an edited image that appeared to depict surgeons installing a heart in someone – but the heart was the like image that is used on Instagram. “A\u0026nbsplot of human beings think this is what love means,” he captioned the\u0026nbsppicture.West has been unusually active on social media in recent weeks. That appears to be ahead of the release of a new album, Yandhi, which looks set to be released at the end of this month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The name is demure the scene, not so much – at least not once they pass the parking lot, the man checking tickets at the front gate and the dim corridor at whose far end blazes a rectangle of bronze sand and sea.Hijabs are unwound from heads, veils tugged from faces. Jeans and abayas evaporate, ulging string bikinis, tankinis and swim shorts. Under spindly cabanas by azure waves, two women lie chest down on lounge chairs, their bare backs implying bare fronts. All around them, gallons of tanning oil glistens on acres of copper skin.When a man on a jet ski buzzes past, a female lifeguard warns him off with a staccato of whistle blasts.“Men,” says Nada, a school bus supervisor from Beirut who was treading the Mediterranean just offshore, “are suffocating.In Lebanon, a sliver of a country on the Mediterranean coast where summer sticks to your skin like moist Saran wrap, the beach is less a luxury than a utility. It is hard to imagine going without.Public and pay-by-the-day beaches line the coast from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north, and every other billboard on the highways out of Beirut seems to display a bikini model promoting a tanning aid\u0026nbsp(SPF, evidently, is not in style).But many observant Muslim women consider it haram – forbidden – to expose their bodies in front of men who are not their husbands or, in some cases, close relatives. Other women may cover themselves in deference to conservative families and communities.For them, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoided those who go with their families roast in the sun fully clothed in hijabs and long-sleeved shirts and pants or abayas, the full-length caftans popular among devout Lebanese Muslim women.Hence the emergence of ladies’ beaches like this one, the Bellevue Beach Club in the seaside town of Jiyeh – a salt-tinged hiatus from the male gaze for $18 (£14) a day, just 20 minutes down a trash-perfumed highway from Beirut.AFPGetty)It is a dedicated patch of sand for conservative women amid the cultural melange of Lebanon, which, with its 18 recognised religious sects and vigorous all-night party scene, tends to be more socially liberal than other Arab countries.At the Bellevue, there seemed to be as many different degrees of scanty cladding as there were women. For some women, religious scruples argued for more coverage. For others, style considerations, and the heat, argued for less. Each woman had made her own peace with the proportions.“Here, I’m free to be me,” says Rabab Amhaz, 35, a housewife from the inland Bekaa Valley. She gestures\u0026nbspto her tankini, bright with a teal floral pattern, and shimmies\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspthe water.Seeking a second opinion on her beach visit, she had consulted her brother, a Hezbollah fighter. He had not only given her his blessing but shown her a YouTube video of a Muslim cleric explaining that swimwear was acceptable among women, so long as the women covered their lower bodies.Nada, who began wearing the veil when she married at age 14, dismisses\u0026nbspthis assessment: you could find a cleric to say anything you wanted, she says.Following her own strong conviction that all the skin on display around her was forbidden (who knew who might be watching from one of the boats that periodically splashed by, or from behind the walls of the resort?),\u0026nbspshe had looked at herself in the mirror that morning and changed into a more modest bottom. She also declined to reveal her last name to a reporter, preferring to avoid the prospect of disapproval at home.But a swimsuit was a swimsuit – in this case, a black-and-white patterned swim tank with black shorts.Created with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

They laugh together and have forgotten about their struggle for nowAt 11 years old, Sara could never have imagined becoming a refugee. Sitting on a swing in Beirut, she hopes for a better future built on a good education and psychosocial support made possible by EAA and UNRWASara has dreams of moving to Canada, Europe or the Gulf states where she can study in English and eventually become a doctor. She didn’t ask to be a refugee and refuses to give up her ﬁght for a better life. Sara wants to be able to contribute to a society by becoming a doctor to help others“When you see me on Facebook, I look completely different,” she says, her hair loose and ropy in the water. “You wouldn’t recognise me.”After next year, when she plans\u0026nbspto make the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim who can afford it is supposed to undertake at least once, she says she would avoid even the ladies’ beach she, like many women who have completed the hajj, will\u0026nbspadopt more modest attire.And she frowns\u0026nbspon the women who have\u0026nbspbrought their young sons, who are allowed up to age 8 on the beach. She does\u0026nbspnot want her sons or grandsons to get used to seeing women’s bodies.But still. “I love to swim,” she says, smiling and shrugging, “so I have no other choice.”Nada and Amhaz agree\u0026nbspon one point: absolutely no beach selfies, not even to share with their husbands.“No, no!” they exclaim, high-fiving.Cameras are banned, the better to protect the beachgoers’ modesty and privacy, though cellphones are not. But visits to several other Lebanese resorts, undertaken purely for journalistic purposes, suggest\u0026nbspfew other differences between women-only beaches and mixed ones beyond the obvious.No matter the setting, gossip and hookah pipes scent the air. Snacks, water and shade are at a premium. People-watching is frequently rewarding.Several ladies’ beaches fringe the coastline south of Beirut, their names redolent of sandy glamour around the world (the Laguna the Bondi). The Bellevue Beach Club began offering women-only days in the mid-1990s after veiled women began asking for privacy.Business was good – better than on mixed days, even. It soon went all women, all the time.A man collects tickets, but no other males are allowed. Women staff the restrooms and the pool. The staff includes the Australian and Filipino wives of the brothers who run the Bellevue, who go to mixed beaches together.There is a female DJ for the thatch-roofed poolside cabana where beachgoers undulate, hips exuberantly swaying\u0026nbspto Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel Wahab and Lebanese singer Maya Yazbek.Lebanon, where people from different sects share offices, neighbourhoods and businesses, and crop tops can outnumber hijabs in some Beirut neighbourhoods, might seem like a natural inventor of the ladies’ beach. But women-only hours at the pool or the beach are common in other parts of the Middle East, too, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, where dress codes for local women are more uniformly conservative.At the Bellevue, there are\u0026nbspno religious strictures on swim attire but each woman’s own.Nada’s 21-year-old daughter wears modest gym clothing when she goes to mixed beaches with her husband at the Bellevue, she wore a bikini top with a short swim skirt. She had brought a Syrian friend who, taken aback at the way the other beachgoers dressed, kept a tank top on.Piles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisSteven Spielberg\u0027s The Post banned in LebanonHow to spend a weekend in BeirutThen there was Rana Ghalayini, a nurse from Beirut who had first put on the veil when she was 12, only to remove it because her family thought she was too young. When she married at 23, she and her husband agreed that she should be veiled. But she had resolved to keep her three young daughters unveiled until they, too, were 23.“Religion is broad,” she says. “It’s a personal choice.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It will stigmatise cyclists. Are they going to be targets?How Great Britain came from nowhere to conquer cycling’s grand tours“It is going to reduce the number of children cycling to school.”Stanley Park High, which has promised pupils training in road awareness and bike maintenance and subsidised bike lights, is thought to be the first school in the country to propose licence plates for cyclists.The school has separately urged parents to park further from the school gates and to encourage their children to cycle to school to tackle traffic congestion.Created with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at Cycling UK, said the bike number plate plans would “make cycling to school more difficult”.He added: “Head teachers have a powerful voice in their community which they should use to encourage their local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic calming measures on the streets their pupils are most likely to cycle on – this will make cycling safer for their pupils, not number plates on bikes.”How to design bike lanes fit for the 21st centuryMotoring groups and cycle campaigners have previously expressed concern about any moves to\u0026nbsproll out bicycle number plates.A survey carried out in November found a majority of the public backed the idea “to encourage responsible cycling”.But Edmund King, president of the AA, described the idea at the time as both “impractical and unnecessary” and said police already had powers to stop cyclists.Cycle campaigners also warned that the huge cost of implementing a system of licenced bikes would fall to taxpayers and such a move would undoubtedly deter people from riding their bicycles.In 2014 Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said cyclists should have the same identification as drivers so they can be prosecuted for jumping red lights.A change in the law would be required for number plates to become mandatory on bicycles, as the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 only provides for the registration of mechanically propelled vehicles.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

British people living in Europe were promised before the referendum that nothing would change for them.Despite the popular image of pensioners retiring to the Costa del Sol, the vast majority of British citizens in Europe – over 80 per cent – are of working age, often doing international jobs that regularly take them around the continent.The increasing looming threat of a no-deal Brexit also means that even these limited negotiated protections might not apply, with the citizens left in a legal limbo – and no alternative plan currently in place.Jane Golding, chair of British in Europe,\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “Time is running out for the British government to show its UK citizens in Europe that we are a priority.\u0026nbspOver the past two years our countless requests for meetings with David Davis, Theresa May and now Dominic Raab have either been refused or ignored.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsphas repeatedly held meetings with the British citizens\u0026nbsp(Reuters)“And yet our situation remains far from secure.\u0026nbspNot only have some of our most burning issues – namely free movement, which many of the 80 per cent of us who are working age or younger rely on for work and family – been kicked into the long grass of the negotiations. But, with the prospect of no deal rising by the day, we run the risk of having our lives thrown into turmoil on Brexit day as everything that’s agreed so far will evaporate into thin air.“Unilateral guarantees on the part of the British government towards EU citizens in the UK or vice versa are not enough, as there are many issues that need to be agreed reciprocally. We urge both Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier to agree to ringfence the existing citizens’ rights deal so that affected people can salvage something from the wreckage of a no deal.”In a letter to Ms May sent last week British in Europe accused Theresa May of “a disgraceful and unacceptable omission” in addressing the rights of her own citizens.“Over the last 18 months the UK has negotiated away our rights, you and your secretaries of state have refused to meet with us and now you completely ignore us at a critical time in the negotiations,” she said.Even under a best-case scenario, as currently negotiated British citizens face a patchwork of different schemes to gain settled status in EU countries if they want to stay. Some states already register migrants, while others want to impose a new system mirroring the British one for EU citizens living in the UK.Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, told The Independent: “The European parliament has set out a number of outstanding issues with regard to the rights of EU and UK nationals that still need to be addressed, to mitigate the consequences of Brexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

If no deal is reached the UK crashes out of the bloc completely on March 29 2019.The Chancellor’s intervention effectively amounts to her siding with French president Emmanuel Macron’s view – that the future relationship plan between the EU and UK must not be left vague just to secure a deal.\u0026nbspSome other EU leaders had suggested allowing the future framework declaration to be a vague list of aspirations in order to ease the passage to an agreement this October – with Ms May’s Chequers plan all-but dead and both sides appaering unlikely to budge on their red lines.But Mr Macron’s approach of holding the UK to a detailed declaration won out amongst leaders at last week’s Salzburg summit, with European Council president Donald Tusk pronouncing after the meeting’s Brexit discussion that any declaration would need to be as detailed as possible.\u0026nbspMs Merkel has now backed him up in public, telling her audience that the goal was now “to formulate future relations with the UK as concretely as possible”.She again rejected the Chequers proposals, stating that the UK “can’t belong to one part of EU common market but not to the other three”.“Playing for time, I believe, also doesn’t help the business community, because the business community needs clarity,” Ms Merkel said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

I’m sure she got a little bit carried away with herself.“If you actually look at the history of the general strike most trade unions will tell you it was an absolute failure for the working class.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, also criticised the Crewe MP’s call, saying: “That\u0027s not our position.

Of course, they’re not.”But the new guidance admits airlines “would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission”.The inside story of the meeting that decided Labour\u0027s Brexit policyMPs condemn Labour plan to deny option to Remain in fresh Brexit voteTory Brexiteers are peddling another fantasy with Canada deal ideaA no-deal Brexit could also force passengers to re-screen luggage and go back through security on, for example, a flight to the UK via Paris or Amsterdam.The department for transport said its “preference” would be to agree “a basic arrangement or understanding” with the EU –\u0026nbsparguing Brussels had already said that would be desirable.Alternatively, it suggested “bilateral arrangements between the UK and an inidual EU country could be put in place, specifying the conditions under which air services would be permitted”.Under the pet passports scheme, which involves a rabies vaccination and a microchip, people can take their dogs, cats or ferrets to the EU and back again without quarantine.The technical notice said the UK is pressing to become a “listed” third country after Brexit, to avoid “burdensome” new requirements.But it admitted that designation as an “unlisted” third country would leave\u0026nbsppet-owners having to discuss travelling with their animals to EU countries with an “official veterinarian” months in advance.UK coach operators were advised to consider subcontracting “all or part” of travel on the continent to EU-based operators, because their licences might not be recognised.Jenny Chapman, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, said: “Today\u0027s Brexit notices underline why no-deal is simply not an option.“The British people will be very alarmed to find out that UK and EU licensed airlines would need to seek new permissions to be able to operate in the event of no-deal.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The affordable fashion brand, known for its handbag range,\u0026nbspwill change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal has closed, the firm said.John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings, said the deal was “an important milestone for our group”. “For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage. Versace fans rebel against the brand’s rumoured sale to Michael KorsWe are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,” he said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to over $2bn in revenues. We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.”Confirmation of the sale comes after fans called on Versace to put a stop to the sale. The Italian luxury brand was founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago. After Mr Versace was murdered in 1997, his family took over the company. The Versace family currently have an 80 per cent stake in the company, while the remaining 20 per cent is held by private equity group Blackstone, which bought into the firm in 2014, with plans to list it on the stock market.However, Blackstone is reported to have found the investment disappointing, and abandoned its plans for a float some time ago.Versace to stop using fur in its collectionsMost people are pronouncing Versace wrongAmerican Crime Story revives fascination in Versace\u0027s deathDonatella Versace, the group’s vice president and chief designer, said: “This is a very exciting moment for Versace. It has been more than 20 years since I took over the company along with my brother Santo and daughter Allegra. I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. “Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of ersity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential.”Ms Versace added: “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.“Santo, Allegra and I will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. This demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”The purchase of Versace is the second major deal announced by Michael Kors in the last 18 months - the company bought shoe designer Jimmy Choo for £921m last year.

The president praised Mr Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped, some military facilities are already being dismantled, Mr Trump said in his address.”I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done.”Created with Sketch.North Korea\u0027s pervasive leaders: the Kim portraits Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of North Korea, portraits of former supreme leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are required by law to be hung in the home, the classroom, the factory and all manner of other private and public placesIn the classroomIn the living roomIn the maternity ward of the hospitalOn board the ship At the ballot boxIn the officeOn the bridegroomOn the Pyongyang subwayIn the teacher training facilityIn Kim Il Sung square in PyongyangIn the homeAt the military paradeIn the hallAt the Chinese borderIn the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of North Korea, portraits of former supreme leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are required by law to be hung in the home, the classroom, the factory and all manner of other private and public placesIn the classroomIn the living roomIn the maternity ward of the hospitalOn board the ship At the ballot boxIn the officeOn the bridegroomOn the Pyongyang subwayIn the teacher training facilityIn Kim Il Sung square in PyongyangIn the homeAt the military paradeIn the hallAt the Chinese borderLike Mr Abe’s, Mr Trump’s remarks were very different from those in his speech last year at the assembly, when he threatened to totally destroy North Korea and mocked the North Korean leader as Rocket Man on a suicide mission”.At a meeting last week with South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in, Mr Kim promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US took corresponding action”.Mr Moon told an event in New York on the sidelines of the UN meeting this week that declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to take further steps.Mr Moon said Mr Kim had told him the corresponding measures he was seeking were security guarantees Mr Trump pledged in Singapore, and moves towards normalisation of relations with Washington.I believe that setting a timetable for all these measures is a task for the second US-North Korea summit, Mr Moon said, and in an interview with Fox News suggested such a summit could take place before the end of this year.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Monday he hoped to travel to North Korea again before the end of the year to make final preparations for a second Trump-Kim summit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Heres all you need to know...A member of the royal family can become a representative or supporter of an organisation as a patron, working to publicise and recognise the groups work.Family members have become linked to thousands of groups, with additional requests from organisations pouring in to Buckingham Palace every year.While some organisations, like The National Portrait Gallery and Arthritis Research UK, are well-known, others like the Anglo-Finnish Society and Beanstalk, are less so.Most royal family members have limited the number of organisations that they support but The Queen and Prince Philip hold more than 1000 patronages between them.Many of the pairs associations were inherited from previous Monarchs.An organisation that has a royal family member as a patron can enjoy increased publicity, with a patronage also seen as an endorsement.Prof Cathy Pharoah, co-director of the centre for giving and philanthropy at Cass Business School at City University, London told the BBC: Its an endorsement that their  work is reputable and high quality.The work of a royal family member with a certain organisation can also help to boost the profile of previously taboo subjects.The Duchess of Cambridge has concentrated her support on mental health and the care of childrens emotional wellbeing, becoming a patron of Place2Be, as well as The Art Room and Action on Addiction.Patronages are generally chosen to reflect the interest of the family member.For example, the Duchess of Cornwall is President of the National Osteoporosis Society as both her mother and grandmother died from the brittle bone disease.Organisations can apply for a patron by submitting a request to the appropriate Private Secretary, who will then pass it onto the family member they think will be most interested.If the royal family member is interested in the group, extensive research will then be undertaken into the organisation.Factors, including that the group is well-established and reputable, are then considered.The  of time that patronages are held are not set in stone.Some royal family members can become involved in a specic campaign, while at other times they can be involved in the organisation for le.Find out the full list here.The first recorded patronage was that of King George II, who became involved in the Society of Antiquaries.The support of the society has continued since then, with it currently under the patronage of The Duke of Gloucestor.Other organisations that have had long links with the royal family include the Mothers Union, which was first supported by Queen Victoria in 1898.The Queen recently announced that she would be passing on her patronage of a number of associations, having been involved with more than 600 organisations.Prince Philip has also confirmed that he will retire from public engagements in 2017, with the full support of the Queen.Each royal family member is involved in hundreds of public engagements - but some are more involved than others.In 2016, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry were involved in an average of 76 public engagements.Their involvement was in stark contrast to that of Anne, the Princess Royal, who carried out the most - carrying out 179 days of engagements.The Prince of Wales, 68, was second on 139, with the Earl of Wessex, 52, on 118 and Duke of York, 56, on 112.Harry, 32, had 86 days of engagements, ahead of his brother William, 34, on 80.Bottom of the list was mum-of-two Kate, 34, with 63 days.By contrast, the Duke of Edinburgh, who turned 95 last year, spent 110 days on duties with it announced in 2017 that he would retire.Official engagements planned for the royal family are published up to eight weeks in advance."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So  youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead?

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

people on board.National Geographic’s Drain the Oceans series has now looked the crash and with the help of experts pinned its likely location in what the wreckage will look like on the ocean floor.The programme says the plane is located at around 35 degrees south on a line known as the seventh arc, in reference to the last time MH370 sent a satellite message.Using computer graphics it has “drained” the area around the seventh arc to reveal what the wreckage of the aircraft could look like.The debris will stretch over thousands of yards, it says, and while the engines will be in one piece, the fuselage will be in thousands.Drain the Oceans says blackboxes will reveal  anyone was in the cockpit at the end and oxygen cylinders show  the plane was deliberately depressurised in flightPersonal electronic devices could reveal the experiences and fate of inidual passengers and crew.Andy Sherrell, an undersea search specialist who has taken part in the hunt for MH370 and found the wrecks of other aircraft underwater, says the moment it is found will be “sombre”.“It’s a really surreal sombre moment because you realise all of a sudden you’ve found this grave site, this place where all these people persished,” Sherrell told the programme.“It’s sad but it’s also a bit of a relief because you know from that point forward some answers are going to come back.”The exact location was arrived at by oceanographer David Grfin using wreckage found thousands of miles away.He believes the flapperon which was found on the French island of Reunion holds the key to finding the location of MH370.Dr Grfin conducted an experiment using an identical flapperon off a Boeing 777 and using data about currents in the Indian Ocean was able to map its 500 day journey across the sea.He was also curious about why no debris had been washed up in Australia when currents in the area where the plane crashed flow towards the country.The scientist was able to rule out areas on the seventh arc where the current flows towards Australia as a possible crash site.Dr Grfin looked at the data for the currents that exists for the day MH370 crashed and pinpointed where on the seventh arc currents would have pushed debris away from Australia towards Africa.Only one of the locations on the seventh arc matched his calculation of the flapperon’s journey – 35 degrees south.The area was not checked during the initial surface search for the wreckage of the plane.His view that MH370 crashed there was backed by images from a French military satellite taken 15 days after the plane’s disappearance showing possible debris on the surface in the 35 south area.“I remember the day when I first saw those images in high resolution and I thought ‘oh my God’,” he said.Beginning in January this year a search was mounted in that area by a privately funded expedition run by salvage company, Ocean Infinity.But despite searching an enormous area, the expedition found no trace of MH370.The search has now covered an area 14 times that in the hunt for Air France flight 447, which crashed in the South Atlantic and took two years to find.In May the Malaysian government called off the search for MH370 but Drain the Oceans says it could lie tantalisingly outside the search area“I think it’s enormously important to find the plane because while planes crash routinely they don’t just disappear and I think this just terries people,” says David Grfin.:Drain The Oceans: Malaysia  Airlines  370 airs on National Geographic this Thursday, 27 September at

kent","story":"After its arrival yesterday, the Beluga disappeared for around 12 hours but has now resurfaced at the Gravesend side of the estuary, a relief to onlookers hoping to catch a sighting of the whale.Birding expert Dave Andrews first saw the white whale, which an expert has confirmed to be a Beluga, at 11am yesterday near Gravesend, Kent.The whale was last seen yesterday at Tilbury Docks on the River Thames, 30 miles from the sea.But at 8.30pm yesterday it disappeared, sparking fears that the Beluga, who is thought to have been forced from its home by storms, might have died.Now the whale is back in its original spot in Gravesend, where it was first seen, causing a sigh of relief from conservationists and spotters. Tweets began appearing at 9.30am today to confirm the whale has resurfaced in Gravesend.Conservationists are now concerned that the Beluga whale could be very lost  it doesnt  to the sea.Rescue teams are on standby to help the whale in case it gets into danger.There are also concerns the Beluga might eat a plastic bag, due to the large numbers of them in the Thames, according to Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority.After first seeing the whale, Andrews tweeted: Cant believe Im writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort.He claimed the whale remained in the same spot for hours feeding around the barges in the river.Marine experts told the BBC it is almost certainly a Beluga whale and urged the public to watch it from the shore.Lucy Babey from ORCA said: This is the most southerly sighting of a beluga we have ever seen around these shores.Belugas can weigh up to 1,400kg and measure more than four metres long.Sightings of Beluga whales are extremely rare on the coasts of the UK and normally only occur off the coast of Scotland, as this is closest to their native waters.Beluga whales usually travel in groups or pods and a sighting of a solo whale could indicate it has got lost, or is disorientated.After Andrews tweeted the exact location, there was an influx of people arriving at the scene to view the whale for themselves.Lucy from ORCA told The Sun: We want to urge people not to disturb the animal. Its out of range and probably distressed.People rushing to the site in boats or with drones will only disturb the whale and cause it more distress.If you wish to see the whale for yourself, stay on the shore and do not get in the water.The last time a whale was spotted in the River Thames was a bottlenose whale, now known as the River Thames Whale.In January 2006 a female northern bottlenose whale swam up the Thames and caused hysteria in London.She sadly died during a rescue mission near Battersea.A spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: Belugas are High Arctic species and this one is thousands of miles from where it should be! Belugas are usually associated close to the ice in places like Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea.He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble. There are a few reports of belugas in the UK in recent years.In the summer of 2015 two were spotted off the Northumberland coast and one in Northern Ireland. We would urge that the whale is given space and disturbance is kept to a minimum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434919685.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"every worker in britain should go on strike to force the tories out mp demands","story":"Laura Smith, the Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, called for a general strike  there isnt a general election that they can try and storm into No10.Speaking at Momentums The World Transformed shadow festival in Liverpool last night, she stormed: Today weve heard calls for a true peoples vote, a general election.We must topple this cruel and callous government as soon as we can.And  we cant get a general election, We should organise with our brothers and sisters to bring an end to this government with a general strike.The crowd went wild for a call, giving her a standing ovation and delighted cheers.The last general strike was in 1926 over wages for coal miners - and 1.7million people took part.Labours shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon applauded her call - along with fellow MP Chris Williamson.But despite the video footage he denied he gave her a standing ovation, and said he didnt support a general strike.He told TalkRadio: I applauded a fantastic speech by Laura Smith who a year ago was a single mother wondering what she could do to help secure a Labour government that would help her community.After a warm reception from the audience, Ms Smith added: That went better than I thought it could have gone!Labour are fighting for another election to try and take power - but this morning Labour figures sought to distance themselves from the call for a strike.Deputy leader Tom Watson slapped her down, and said it wasnt a helpful thing to say.He told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: Well, its not particularly helpful, but she is a new MP and she was at a big fringe event - nothing to do with the party organisation - and Im sure she got a little bit carried away.And business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was not Labour party policy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So she pays tax on that, nothing else, just that.“She doesnt pay tax on anything else. And as we know she also has some money offshore, so thats disappointing.”In fact, the monarch voluntarily pays tax on all her private income whatever its source.Ms Dent Coad has a track record of angry rants at the royal family.At the same event at last year’s Labour conference, she sparked fury by claiming Prince Harry is unable to fly a helicopter.EMMA Dent Coad became Kensington’s first Labour MP at last year’s General Election, winning the seat by just 20 votes.But she is a longstanding opponent of her constituency’s best-known residents - Princes William and Harry, who both live in Kensington Palace with their wives.Ms Dent Coad is such an ardent republican she even held an anti-royal picnic on the day William married Kate in 2011.And since entering Parliament she has continued slagging off the royals in a string of public rants.The Sun revealed at last year’s Labour conference that she accused Harry of being unable to fly a helicopter.Ms Dent Coad claimed that whenever the prince gets in a chopper, “He just sits there going ‘vroom vroom’.”She’s also compared the Middleton family to the Kardashian clan, dubbing the Duchess of Cambridge “Kate Kardashian”.The MP caused offence ahead of Harry and Meghan’s wedding this year by saying Princess Diana would be upset by the public attention paid to the nuptials.And speaking on the day of the ceremony, Ms Dent Coad called for the National Anthem to be scrapped because it’s “jingoistic”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436781711.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ruins found in israeli wilderness could prove biblical story of exodus in which moses led israelites from slavery experts believe","story":"According to the Bible, Moses liberated the Israelites from their Egyptian rulers and led them through the wilderness of Sinai, before they crossed the River Jordan into the promised land of Canaan.Until now no historical basis for the legend was thought to exist and archaeologists generally agreed that the Israelites were in fact native to Canaan – an ancient region covering modern day Israel.Experts are now analysing whether the ruins could be proof of a nomadic people crossing into the ancient land from outside.David Ben-Shlomo, an archaeologist with Ariel University, said: “We have not proved that these camps are from the period of of the early Israelites, but it is possible.“If they are, this might fit the biblical story of the Israelites coming from east of the Jordan River, then crossing the Jordan and entering into the hill country of Israel later.”Archaeologists are now analysing whether the ruins, named Khirbet el Mastarah, are consistent with a newly-arrived nomadic people.Pottery shards from the site have been dated to the early Iron Age, around the time traditionally associated with the Israelite arrival.The ruins themselves, a number of low walls, are believed to be rudimentary stone fencing for animals – consistent with known nomadic practices.According to Ben-Shlomo and his American dig partner, Ralph Hawkins of Averett University, this could explain why pottery shards at the site were found outside – not inside – the stone walls.“The floors of the structures were virtually empty of finds, and thus, we could not date them by conventional archaeological methods,” they said.“In Bedouin settlements, people live in tents made of perishables which are relocated every season, thus artacts would not be associated with stone architecture.“So the structures might have housed animals, rather than people, who lived in tents around them.”The site, five miles north of Jericho, also makes more sense as a nomadic settlement than a permanent one.Temperatures there can easily reach a searing 45C and annual rainfall is as little as 1cm.“The landscape is arid most of the time and even in modern times most of the population here are Bedouins,” said Ben-Shlomo.Furthermore, the site is isolated and is shielded from view by the surrounding hills – perhaps implying a new population in fear of a hostile reception.Archaeologists are working to confirm whether site is as old as they suspect.“Since this area is not densely populated in many periods, this might indicate a new phenomenon like nomads suddenly creating settlements, or a new population.”The archaeologists are also planning to excavate nearby Uja el-Foqa to determine whether it might be linked to Israelite settlement of the region.The work is not without its challenges – archaeologists must look for cultural clues that the site was indeed Israelite.“It is dficult since many aspects of the material culture of dferent groups, say those from east or west of the Jordan River, may be too similar or not indicative enough,” Ben-Shlomo said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004357663472.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may chequers plan eu cracking","story":"Dferences are finally emerging among the 27 other leaders who have been unied until now, the PM told her top table on Monday as she implored them to “hold our nerve”.And she believes the UK can exploit them to win goods-only access to the single market.In a bid to cheer up her Cabinet during her update to them on last week’s disastrous Salzburg summit, the PM told them: “Some heads of government want to be more constructive than the commission”.But pinning the UKs hopes on an uprising by Scandinavian and Eastern states along with the Netherlands and Belgium against France and Germany’s axis with the EU Commission is seen as very high risk by senior ministers.Despite rumblings from smaller states such as Hungary, a revolt failed to materialise at in the Austria town when leaders unanimously agreed to crush Mrs May’s Chequers plan.A Cabinet source: “The noises coming from the member states themselves are certainly better than what’s coming out of the commission.“But it’s a far cry to then say we’ll be able to win them all over.“Theresa is doubling up on where she already is and it’s looking like a huge bet now.”The development came as senior hardline Tory Brexiteers also turned up the pressure on Mrs May to dump her Chequers plan.A senior figure in the European Research Group revealed all of its 8 odd members are ready to vote down her plan in Parliament.Former minister Mark Francois told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: If push really comes to shove, and they try and push Chequers through the House of Commons, then I and my colleagues will vote against it”.A senior EU diplomat also last night told The Sun that Mrs May would not get EU leaders to budge and accept her bid for goods only access to the single market.The diplomat said: They don’t believe us on the Single Market. They think it’s b****ks.“They don’t understand the argument that  we give too much flexibility the whole thing will fall apart because everyone will want an a la carte deal. We’ve said this over and over again but they don’t want to hear it.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday that a Brexit deal “might already be achievable in October, but only  the UK makes some big decisions. Ms Merkel warned: “Playing for time, I believe, also doesn’t help the business community, because the business community needs clarity.“We have six to eight weeks of very hard work ahead of us in which we have to take the political decisions. A lot depends on what Britain really wants”She added the UK can’t belong to one part of the Single Market but “not to the other three”.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was speaking at The World Transformed festival, which is running alongside Labour Party Conference in Liverpool.  But Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey insisted it was not party policy. She said: Well that\u0027s not our position. Laura is an absolutely amazing MP, she\u0027s one of the North West MPs with myself, she\u0027s so full of energy and enthusiasm, but we\u0027re certainly not advocating general strikes as Labour Party policy.  She added: Just to make it perfectly clear a general strike is not Labour Party policy. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said he thought Ms Smith got a little bit carried away with her general strike comments. He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: Well, it\u0027s not particularly helpful, but she is a new MP and she was at a big fringe event - nothing to do with the party organisation - and I\u0027m sure she got a little bit carried away.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his top team have stated their aim of securing a general election throughout the conference, which has been dominated by Brexit and the issue of a second referendum.   On Tuesday, the Prime Minister said it would not be in the national interest to hold a general election before Brexit day on March 29. Ms Smith, who is a member of the Unite and Unison unions and a former teacher, raised suggestion of a general strike at The World Transformed festival on Tuesday night. Today we\u0027ve heard calls for a true people\u0027s vote. A general election, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich said. Comrades, we must topple this cruel and callous Tory Government as soon as we can. And  we can\u0027t get a general election, we should organise with our brothers and sisters in the trade unions to bring an end to this government with a general strike.

Crowds chanted “Oh Jeremy Corbyn ” as our live house band played along when the Labour leader visited the bash, held at Liverpool\u0027s Revolucion De Cuba, marking the climax of the party’s annual conference. But sadly, he wasn\u0027t up for a boogie - immediately declaring emphatically with a smile: I am NOT going to dance!  As boos rang out in the bar, he joked: Well, that\u0027s a sign of unity, isn\u0027t it? Thanks a lot. He thanked the Mirror and the GMB union, who sponsored the party. He said: I look forward to the Mirror making demands of a Labour government of what we can achieve in this country.  He added: I want to say thank you to the Mirror for the social campaigns you\u0027ve undertaken, the fantastic Pride of Britain awards they put on every year, and being that voice that\u0027s prepared to give us a fair hearing. I\u0027m not asking for agreement on everything. I\u0027m not asking for approval. But just give us a fair hearing - plenty of the others don\u0027t.  Also at the legendary annual bash - the biggest party of Labour Party Conference - were John McDonnell, and Diane Abbott. While Corbyn didn\u0027t dance, plenty of Labour MPs were spotted tearing up the dancefloor.

Ten years after the crash that led to crushing austerity, Labour\u0027s leader was set to claim the establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system. And he was set to blast the “greed-is-good culture that came crashing to earth with devastating consequences.  New policies include a massive investment in green energy which Labour claims would create 400,000 jobs by 2030 - doubling onshore wind farms, septupling offshore wind farms and reversing Tory solar subsidy cuts.   Meanwhile Labour\u0027s policy of 30 hours\u0027 free childcare for ALL two, three and four-year-olds will be extended with unlimited free hours for the poorest families.

The Labour leader is to use his speech at the party conference to announce a huge expansion in free childcare for hard-pressed families. Mr Corbyn will also outline plans for nationalisation of industries run by greedy bosses only interested in profits, boost workers’ pay and launch a drive for 400,000 green jobs as he sets about rebuilding a Britain for “the many not the few”. In a pledge of “real hope” he is to offer 30 hours of \u0026shy“genuinely free” childcare to all parents of two, three and four-year-olds in England. At the moment it is only for the two older age groups in term time. And there will be a boost in pay and skill levels of childcare staff.  Mr Corbyn will tell delegates in Liverpool: “Opportunity matters most in the earliest years of le. “It is a crucial time to open up children’s le chances. Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital dference for millions of our children.” Labour will also offer extra, means-tested subsidised hours on top of the free allowance. These will be free for households earning less than \u0026pound16,000 and cost no more than \u0026pound4 an hour for those on higher incomes of \u0026pound66,000 and more. There will be a sliding scale of fees in between. A source said there would be no limit to the number of extra hours a family could claim. But the \u0026pound4.8billion package of reforms has been costed by \u0026shyestimating how many hours would be taken up. Mr Corbyn will also hit out at the reckless capitalism that brought about the crash of 2008.  He is to say: “Ten years ago this month, the whole edice of greed is good, deregulated financial \u0026shycapitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences. “But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the \u0026shypolitical and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash. “People in this country know, they showed that in June last year, that the old way of running things isn’t working any more. That’s why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.” As well as announcing plans to save the NHS from its wilful Tory destruction, Mr Corbyn will tell of his ambitious plan to launch a green jobs revolution as he vows to tackle climate change.  He is to say: “There is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example. “Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations. “That means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move towards a low-carbon economy. And it means working with industry to change the way we build, and to train the workforce to retrofit homes and work in the industries we will build. “I can announce that Labour will kickstart a green jobs revolution. “Our programme of transformation to achieve a 60% reduction in \u0026shyemissions by 2030 will create over 400,000 skilled jobs, based here and on union rates, bringing skills and security to communities held back for too long.” Mr Corbyn will rally the party by telling members to prepare for a snap election in case Theresa May is destroyed by Brexit. Speaking ahead of his speech, the 69-year-old vowed to carry on as leader to oversee his rebuilding programme.  Mr Corbyn, who shared a platform with Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey yesterday, said: “I’m very healthy, very fit, very proud to lead our party. ,],totalVotes:25,votesToShow:0,mentometerId:13310760,publicationId:2,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror/poll-ws/poll/13310760/status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror/poll-ws/poll/13310760/vote,closed:false,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:false,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan im supporting high","story":"NewsopinionSadiq Khan: I\u0027m supporting our high streets as Mayor - now the Government must do its bit tooIn the past 12 months alone, 51,504 businesses on UK high streets closed while 42,166 opened – a net loss of 9,338Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySadiq KhanMayor of London22:30, 24 SEP 2018NewsopinionSadiq Khan believes the high street has been treated unfairly \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOur high streets are at the heart of our communities. But in recent years they have come under enormous pressure. Too often we see boarded-up shops and units sitting empty or independent local businesses priced out, victims of soaring business rates, rent hikes and undercutting by online retailers. The Government’s decision to hike business rates following the 2017 revaluation left many small, independent companies lumbered with extortionate bills they simply cannot pay. In the past 12 months alone, 51,504 businesses on UK high streets closed while 42,166 opened – a net loss of 9,338.  That’s why I’m lending my support to the Daily Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign.

Hayley Kalinins, 37, from Borrowash, Derby had inspired the city during her seven-year battle against the disease but tragically died last week. The day before she died her heartbroken husband Andy Kalinins showed her a video of her kids Taylor, Hayden and Deena-Marie playing piano and telling their mum how much they loved her. He didn\u0027t know it would be the last she would see of them. In the sweet clip the kids take turns on the piano before saying: Hi Mum, we\u0027re all fine here. We love you. Keep battling on, they say. We all love you.  The 52-year-old performance director for Sheffield Wednesday said: The day before she died, she whispered to me that she loved me and I held her hand. I just wanted to hold it forever. I showed her a video of the kids playing the piano. It was the last thing she would see of them. We always have this thing where we give each other the thumbs up and she did that as I left. That was the last time I saw her. It was just so sad. He described his we as a happy, smiling and wonderful person, who had a real zest for le and lived every second to the full.  Speaking to Derbyshire Live about Hayley\u0027s le and how he hopes he can be strong for their four children.  He said: This is a love story, but it has a sad ending. I now have to carry that on and start the next book which is about being strong for my kids and ensuring that they fulfil their dreams in the future. To me, she isn\u0027t really gone. I still feel her presence and spirit in the house. I can still hear her and every time I make a decision, I can hear what she would say, as I have known her for so long.  I still can\u0027t move her things. I have left her shoes where they are. It will be a while before I can bring myself to do anything like that. I said before that I would not let cancer beat this family and I stand by that. My we was strong and I am sure my children will have that strength within them. They give me a purpose in le and I will be strong for them. In March 2011, Andy and Hayley had a wonderful family le. Their youngest daughter Deena-Marie had just been born and, professionally, Andy had just won the League Cup with Birmingham City. Things changed in July though when Hayley was diagnosed with breast cancer. As time progressed, it spread to her liver and lungs. She started chemotherapy and began having bouts of treatment every three weeks, racking up a total of 70 treatments. When the NHS said they could do no more to help her, a huge fund-raising campaign was launched. It generated almost \u0026pound250,000 for treatment in Germany. Andy said: Hayley was always smiling and always happy. I used to text her calling her \u0027Happy\u0027. That is what drew me to her when we met when we both worked at Derby County.

Choosing to stay anonymous, the couple, met in 2010 and began experimenting with swinging last year. The man, referred to as G, and the woman, known as J, from Braintree in Essex, said their sex lives were fairly conventional until they looked into using swinging clubs in their area.  But despite being open to a more alternative sex le and not actually married themselves, J admitted. It can ruin your marriage, reports Essex Live .  Speaking about how they discovered their shared interest, G, who was previously addicted to sex, said: Before we met, I was sex hungry. I was very adventurous, I had done threesomes and foursomes. Some people just wanted to come to my flat and get on with it, but it\u0027s all very well having them round but once they leave, you\u0027re on your own.  J, the less adventurous of the two, admitted to only having slept with a girl before they met.  G and J first met in Colchester  town centre in 2010, and for the first few years of their relationship their sex le was normal.  In 2014, they began to look into the practice of swinging, but it wasn\u0027t until last year that they visited their first swinging club. Swinging comes in many dferent forms, and it is not limited to just heterosexual couples. Whether you are gay, straight, or bisexual, single or have been happily married for 20-odd years, anyone can be a \u0027swinger\u0027. In its most common form, the practice involves couples doing what\u0027s called a \u0027full swap\u0027, where two couples will swap partners and engage in full sexual intercourse. G and J first looked into swinging after one of G\u0027s work colleagues would constantly talk about the app \u0027Fab Swingers\u0027.  The 48-year-old said:  I used to take it with a pinch of salt but then I downloaded the app and started looking into it. There were a lot of fake people on there, old men pretending to be couples or young attractive women in the hope they would get some action. People go on it to experience something new, and the minority of fakes ruin it for others. The first club G and J attended was Mingles in Colchester in 2017, a private members club for over 25s, advertised as somewhere to relax, have fun and play in a beautul, sexy environment.

Laura, 34, was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 tramadol tablets into the north African country while on holiday in October 2017.  She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband Omar’s bad back, reports Hull Live .  Her latest bid for freedom was rejected by judges in Egypt. According to the BBC, the family have said the devastating blow has only strengthened their resolve to keep up the fight for Laura to be freed. In the statement, the family said: This result, whilst upsetting, only strengthens our resolve to keep fighting for Laura. She fights every day to survive and we won\u0027t give up until she is back home where she belongs.  Ms Plummer was jailed on Boxing Day last year for carrying hundreds of painkillers Tramadol in her suitcase into the African country. She had already been in custody for two months before her sentencing. She had hoped the Egyptian appeal court would accept she had no way of knowing the Tramadol pills were banned. But she was left in tears after judges in Cairo upheld her conviction and three-year prison sentence. Laura\u0027s Egyptian husband, Omar Saad, 34, broke the news to her inside the notorious Al Qanater prison, where she is living in a cell with 20 other women in 34C heat. In a handwritten letter given to The Sun, Laura said: I was sure they would see sense. This whole situation is just ridiculous. I just want to come home. She also hit out at the UK Foreign Office, who she says refuses to intervene on her behalf. She said: How can they leave me in here? Ms Plummer was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 Tramadol tablets into Egypt while on holiday in October 2017. She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband, Omar\u0027s bad back. She said: What don\u0027t these people get? I wonder  I\u0027ve died and this is hell. What did I do so wrong in my le to end up here?  I thought the appeal judges would see sense and realise I couldn\u0027t have known the tablets were banned. It\u0027s just so absurd. Her brother Kirk has recently spoken of the emotional rollercoaster the whole family have been trapped on since she was jailed. In an interview with Viking FM, he said: I wouldn\u0027t wish what me and my family are going through on anybody, nobody. No one wants to see their daughter or sister in prison and  it happened to them then they would realise just how bad it is. But what are we going through is nothing compared to what Laura is going through in prison out there. You sometimes just sit and think and it hits you again that she is still there and as a family we are trying to get on and lead a normal le but it\u0027s hard and you are constantly reminded taht she is still there with 20 other women sat on a cell floor. The last six months have been an emotional rollercoaster and you get ups and downs.

Kelvin Greenhalghse was due to appear in court for a review last week, but failed to turn up. And it has since emerged the door of his former home has been boarded up.  One neighbour also claims the 59-year-old\u0027s flat has been raided a few times, reports the Daily Record .  Greenhalghse was one of the attackers who targeted Louise Duddy, a former hairdresser and part-time model, in the acid attack which scarred her for le.  Louise\u0027s two children were also badly burned in the terrying ordeal, which left the mum a prisoner in her own home. Greenhalghse was convicted earlier this year of drug dealing from his flat in an Edinburgh high-rise. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sherf Court to being concerned in the supply of cocaine from the Moncrieffe House from June 25 to July 24 last year. He received a 12-month drug testing treatment order from Sherf Frank Crowe. Greenhalghse was due in court last week for a review of the order but failed to appear. In 1991, he was paid \u0026pound3,000 by Louise’s ex-husband, Gordon Modiak, to throw concentrated sulphuric acid in her face. Modiak calmly watched the assault from a getaway car in Edinburgh’s Slateford area.  Greenhalghse was jailed for 20 years – but released after 14 years. Tragic Louise was just 16 when she met Modiak, who was eight years older, falling pregnant a year later. The couple married but the relationship was violent. Louise finally left him but a court order insisting he stay away from his ex-partner was ineffective. Modiak began plotting the attack on his ex-we three months after their orce. In February 1991, Greenhalghse hit Louise, then 26, full in the face with the acid as she got her two kids into a car in Hutchison Place. The acid burned into her eyes, leaving her blind and with horric facial injuries. It burned the enamel off her teeth and scarred her legs where it dripped through her clothes. Modiak – who failed in an appeal against his sentence – spent 14 years in prison. In December 1991, Greenhalghse, then of Armadale, West Lothian, lost his appeal against conviction.

But, when he ed to Liverpool Central at 8pm with his kebab, he claims he was told he couldn\u0027t board the train despite being \u0027nowhere near drunk\u0027.  I went to get my ticket out but dropped it on the floor, when I picked it up the guard told me I was too drunk to get on the train, James told Liverpool Echo .   James, from Chester, said he then demanded police arrest him after an argument on the platform. I did the right thing as I didn\u0027t drive and used public transport, but  I am going for a few drinks, I expect to get home. But this could happen to someone else who is not able to pay for a taxi and is forced to walk the streets at night or be stranded, the self-employed electrician added. James was taken to a police station and released shortly after. He says he is thankful to the officers for how they handled the situation. He claims he then managed to get a train home from a dferent station with no problems.  He said: It was embarrassing being dragged out of the station like a criminal. I am a respectable member of society. But, I had to insist on being arrested because I had to stand up for the people as it\u0027s not right  it\u0027s a lottery as to  you are able to get home.

I know there is a policy but it\u0027s double standards. If I couldn\u0027t get on there when I was drunk, why are the trains full after the [Aintree] races and on the last service on a Saturday?

The Italian Gelato Co in Manchester city centre was evacuated when other customers started coughing and staff feared the substance was something more sinister. Police, specialist firefighters and paramedics were all called to the cafe on Portland Street in Piccadilly on Tuesday evening. Initial reports came in as \u0027gas being set off\u0027 so a \u0027considerable police response\u0027 was scrambled, a GMP spokesman said. A fire service spokesman confirmed that several teams were sent to the scene shortly after 7pm, initially to reports of a possible ‘hazardous material’.   Two crews from Manchester Central, two from Bury, one from Moss Side, one from Hyde, and a specialist unit were all sent to the ice cream parlour. The shop was evacuated and specialist officers carried out a survey of the restaurant, the Manchester Evening News reports.  It was later found that the substance was not dangerous and police confirmed it was perfume. Izzy Baig, owner of the cafe, got a call from her manager after the incident to explain what had happened. She told the M.E.N: We had three teenagers and they sprayed some kind of gas, or liquid, into the restaurant. Everyone started coughing and we had to evacuate the store and call police. In the end, it was some kind of perfume, but because of the smell everyone started coughing. They  had started being silly and spraying it on each other. If they had sprayed it and stayed where they were it would have been fine, but they ran outside which caused the alarm. Staff were thinking it looked suspicious because they ran away, so called the police. There were two girls and one boy, but two of them left their phones on the table. When they came back one of our staff stopped the boy until police arrived.

The 37-year-old has had to learn royal protocol, change her wardrobe, stop eating certain foods and now must be very careful about what she says and how she acts in public. But as she\u0027s still getting the hang of things, it should come as no surprise that she does something \u0027normal\u0027 and a little quirky every now and then.  Take for example last night , during her first solo royal engagement, when she did something rather unusual for a royal - something that both The Queen and Kate Middleton typically never do in public according to The Express. What was it that she did? The Duchess of Sussex closed her own car door. Yep, you read that right.  Upon arriving at the opening of the Oceania exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts , the former actress stepped out of the car and was greeted by one of the event\u0027s hosts. She then proceeded to shut the car door behind her before heading inside the building. People on social media are obsessed with the fact that Meghan did something so \u0027normal\u0027 and many have praised her for being so down to earth. One person said: A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! Another commented: First time I\u0027ve seen an on-duty princess shut her own car door...    A third wrote: I had to smile - Meghan is closing the door of that car herself - you know she\u0027s still used to doing that... I don’t think Meghan Markle sees herself as better than anyone else. She knows that she and Prince Harry are blessed to have found each other. I’m proud of her. Le is good, added a fourth. Unsurprisingly there were a lot of others who didn\u0027t understand why closing a door was such a big deal. I can’t believe Meghan Markle closing a car door is big news, this world is broken, posted a Twitter user.    A member of the Royal Family has actually managed to close car door all by themselves. I might have to go and have a lie down now, joked another. A third said: This is not news. Unless she cures cancer, then this shouldn’t make headlines. Some people can\u0027t believe that Meghan Markle closed her own door. Meghan\u0027s attendance at the exhibit marked a milestone in her le as an official member of the royal family, as she stepped out in public alone - without the support of her husband or any other royals. The day was also signicant as it marked a year since Meghan and Harry made their first public appearance as an official couple.

The duchess was attending the opening of a major art exhibition \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts in Central London.  As she came to the end of her tour, she rubbed noses and foreheads with a male guest at the event.  The gesture is known as a Hongi and is considered the equivalent of a formal handshake in Maori culture.  Meghan\u0027s attendance at the event marks a milestone in her le as an official member of the royal family, as she steps out in public alone - without the support of her husband or any other royals. Meghan, 37, stunned in a black \u0026pound2,510 Givenchy dress and her favourite Aquazzura \u0027Deneuve\u0027 heels, topped off with a black Givenchy clutch bag - with some glitz in the form of 12,000  diamond earrings.    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry take secret trip to Amsterdam for three-day party - and it looks incredible  The Duchess viewed art from the Oceania region, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, encompassing the Pacic region including New Guinea, Easter Island, Hawaii and New Zealand. When the duchess first arrived she was shown a large artwork by four female New Zealand women, blue tarpaulin woven into a large cloth that symbolised a rising wave. Some of the group, called the Mata Aho Collective, also welcomed Meghan with the traditional Maori nose rub greeting. Artist Sarah Hudson said: We thought it might be a nice bit of practice before she comes to the Pacic next month and it\u0027s nice to be able to practice something that\u0027s customary for us.  She\u0027s honouring our heritage and it\u0027s so humbling. Meghan stepping out for the first time without the support of other royals or her husband is a milestone in a her le in the British monarchy. But today also has another touching meaning, as it marks a year since Meghan and Harry made their first public appearance as an official couple.  On September 25 last year, the couple stepped out at the Invictus Games in Toronto. Before revealing to the world they were officially in a relationship, Meghan and Harry had been quietly dating for months. Kate Middleton, The Duchess of Cambridge carried out her first solo engagement - standing in for the Prince of Wales at a private fundraising dinner - in October 2011, almost six months after her wedding day. Meghan, who married on May 19, is taking part in her first royal event by herself four months after becoming a member of the monarchy.

Kelly Edgson-Payne was mortied and in tears when a male member of cabin crew told her she could not feed her one-year-old son Lex during take-off. The 36-year-old was flying from London Gatwick to Fuerteventura, Spain, on August 20, with her husband Ross, 40, and four children, when the unpleasant incident happened. Kelly, from Rochester, Kent, said: It\u0027s just absolutely crazy that I was told that I couldn\u0027t feed him - crazy, and really embarrassing for me.   Kelly - who says she has never had an issue breastfeeding any of her children on flights - has now hit out at easyJet for not seeming to know the law about breastfeeding.  I find it really disappointing that an airline I trust, and who we fly with all the time, actually broke the law in discriminating against me as a breastfeeding mother, she said. The law in the UK says it protects breastfeeding mothers - and even easyJet\u0027s own website says mothers are welcome to breastfeed at any time during a flight. There\u0027s just no consistency in their messages. They should not be discriminating against breastfeeding.  When the sports therapist raised the issue with easyJet Customer Services, she was told she was welcome to breastfeed her baby on their flights - as long as you are discreet. She added: We fly with easyJet literally all the time, and I have always breastfed all my children over the years during take-off - because their ears pop which and its uncomfortable for them. Most other cabin crew would actually encourage breastfeeding during take-off, because it distracts them and stops them from crying. I\u0027ve never before been told that I can\u0027t feed Lex, or any of my other children - and we\u0027ve flown with him about 16 times in the last year. So I got settled into my seat and I started to feed my son, as I would usually. Then a male member of cabin crew came over and told me I couldn\u0027t feed him during take-off, and that I\u0027d have to stop and strap him in to his infant seat next to me. Kelly continued: It was just crazy. I said, \u0027Well, he\u0027s feeding\u0027. But I just had to stop mid-feed and hand him to my husband.  I was mortied. I\u0027m not afraid to breastfeed my baby wherever - I\u0027ve stopped at a break point during a marathon before and fed him - but this left me embarrassed and in tears. I had to very quickly cover myself up - but my breasts were still leaking milk, because I had stopped mid-feed. Even my eldest daughter, who is nine, said, \u0027Mummy, they can\u0027t tell you not to breastfeed him\u0027. Kelly, mum to Mia, nine, Elena, five, Jax, three, and Lex, one, said a female member of cabin crew later approached her after take-off and apologised for the incident.

The ironic thing is, since having my third and fourth children, whenever I fly I have always booked my infant a seat next to me. So I\u0027ve never in the last six years sat next to a random passenger.

Laura Battrum, 35, was obese, weighing 22 stone, when she decided weight loss surgery was her only option after exhausting all diets.  She was thrilled that her dream of starting a family with partner, Steve, 37, was one step closer after the NHS agreed to pay for the operation.  But just weeks after the operation last January, Laura claims she had to be rushed to hospital where she was left fighting for her le.   She claims she developed a deadly blood infection known as sepsis and was rushed into Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.  Laura, from Kings Heath, said she was given three days to live as her condition worsened and she spent four weeks in an induced coma. After four months in hospital, Laura was finally allowed home to recover, she added. Laura said she has since battled a number of health problems and has hired lawyers from Irwin Mitchell to investigate her care at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.  She had the initial surgery at a dferent NHS hospital. Laura, a health and social assessor who now weighs nine stone, said: I had been overweight my entire le and would binge on food most days. I tried diet pills, countless diets and exercise but nothing worked. I needed to lose weight  I wanted to become a mum one day so I decided to research weight loss surgery. After opting for the gastric sleeve I was booked in for the surgery on January 3.  I was then discharged from hospital but over the next coming weeks I began to feel unwell and was unbeknownst to me, battling sepsis. I\u0027d developed a rash at first, then diarrhoea and shortness of breath. I saw medical professionals within those weeks and sepsis was not picked up. I sought medical attention, however, it wasn\u0027t until January 29, when Steve called for an ambulance while I was in and out of consciousness that I was diagnosed with sepsis. The following day I was placed into an induced coma and wasn\u0027t awoken until February 27. She said she now has a stoma and still continues to suffer with mobility problems and fatigue. Laura said: For several weeks I was in more and more pain. It got to the point when the pain got so bad Steve called for an ambulance and that is the last thing I really remember.  The seriousness of my condition only hit home when, after coming round from my coma, the doctors said it was touch and go whether I was going to pull through. I did not really know much about sepsis and how dangerous it can be before I fell ill. But following my surgery I developed sepsis and was left fighting for my le. I was terried I would never wake up and I was in a coma for four weeks battling the infection. I only wanted to lose weight but I almost lost my le. I underwent emergency surgery for a perforated bowel and a further six operations in an attempt to finally beat the sepsis. My health problems have been an ongoing war with the stoma and mobility issues still causing problems, but I\u0027m now trying to raise awareness of what is referred to as the silent killer.

Thankfully the infant was not struck by a passing car after a hero motorist blocked the road - which has a 40mph speed limit - to protect him. Stunned Cory Cannon said it is lucky the baby was not killed after getting out of his home unaccompanied. The 41-year-old driver swerved across the road after seeing the child, who he initially mistook for a plastic toy. The married father-of-one slowed down - and was horried when he saw the object move, and realised it was a baby.  The tot was crawling on all fours in the middle of the busy road. The TV technician stopped traffic with his vehicle, before snapping a photo as evidence while he raced towards the little one. Terried he would be accused of taking the baby, he quickly called to a neighbour to come and pick up the little boy while he held back the traffic in Lakewood, New Jersey. He spotted a nearby home with an open door and screen - and alerted the father who was inside and apparently oblivious to his missing child, on Saturday afternoon, he said.  Cory, from Eatontown, New Jersey, USA, said: I wasn\u0027t sure what it was until I saw the baby move. I walked up to the child and the neighbour came out and picked up the baby. She wasn\u0027t exactly sure where he had come from. I was so shocked. It\u0027s a pretty busy road but because it\u0027s a Saturday it was much quieter. It was such a dangerous situation.

Stephen Ringo weighed 29st at his heaviest after gorging on two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets every day for lunch, followed by a Domino\u0027s pizza for dinner. But after the collapse of his married it forced the 38-year-old to re-evaluate his health and he knew he had to make a change. Before he lost weight, Stephen, of Johnson City, Tennessee, was so large he struggled to put on his socks, and the extra pounds drove his sex drive “into the ground”.  The 5ft 7in IT expert said his body issues deeply affected his confidence and wore away at his marriage until he got orced in 2016. Stephen then began to curb his fast food addiction and ed to his power-lting roots in October 2016, shedding an incredible 16 stone in just two years. The super slimmer said: “It’s fair to say that my weight ruined my marriage. “It was the single biggest factor. “My relationship with my we deteriorated as my weight crept up. “I was depressed and as that set in intimacy kind of left. My weight drove my sex le into the ground.  “I believe my depression and lack of sex drive ultimately drove my we away from me. “If I had been a better husband I might have been able to pull the marriage back together. “My weight held me back from doing so many things. Getting dressed in the morning was tough. I could hardly put on my socks. “My ex-we and I went on vacation to New York City in 2012 and my weight really took a toll on me. When you’re in New York, there is a lot of walking involved. After a walk in Central Park I had to sit on a bench to catch my breath for a half an hour. I felt like a failure. I never prepared meals and I usually ate fast food, he added.  I would usually go to McDonald’s for lunch and order a Big Mac family meal, which was two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets. I would drive through the drive through so they might think I was ordering the meal for a family. After I finished I always felt so bad about myself. I hated myself. For dinner I would order Pizza Hut or Domino\u0027s. I was almost as round as I was wide. My pants were 60ins and I was 67ins tall. Stephen said his  to the gym in October 2016 was extremely discouraging as he realised how far he had let his fitness slip.  But the former powerlter hit the gym every day and began practicing intermittent fasting which sees him eat only between 5pm and 9pm each evening. The combination, which Stephen has documented on his YouTube channel, has helped him shed 222lbs and his 60ins waist shrink to 32in. Stephen said: “My first time in the gym I was disgusted with myself. I could literally bench 175lbs which is as much as I could when I was a young teenager. “I don’t know how I had let myself get that far. “Gradually I’ve built myself back up 340lbs. “Now I practice intermittent fasting which means I only eat between 5pm and 9pm. When I get home I break my fast with an apple and for dinner I have ground turkey and a pound of green beans. “I have two cups of air popped popcorn and one low-fat ice cream.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meditation teacher claims hangover cure","story":"NewsMeditation teacher claims hangover cure takes just 11 minutes to work - and starts working instantlyInstagram favourite Rory Kinsella says it can take just a few minutes to feel betterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills23:01, 25 SEP 2018NewsWoman with a hangover after a party \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man claims to have invented a hangover cure that will get you feeling back to normal in just 11 minutes.

Steve Beard had moved to a village in Siberia after falling in love a decade ago with schoolteacher-turned-businesswoman Ruslana Lesyuta, then 42, on a dating website. The Brit was planning to fly back to the UK to arrange for his pension payments to reach him in remote Irkutsk, where temperatures plummet to minus 50C or below in winter. But when the dad flew to Moscow he was barred from leaving Russia because his residency permit had expired - and his plight has been compared to the plot in the Hollywood film The Terminal.  Steve, who has an eight-year-old son named Robert, told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: “They stopped me and did not let me fly out of the country. I was fined. “And the migration service urged me to  to Irkutsk.” Instead, Steve, who worked for 30 years in a London metals plant, flew to Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg to try and leave Russia there. But again he was forbidden to pass immigration and fly to his homeland.   In despair, he stayed in the terminal without any cash or a bank money, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported:  It was only due to help from a Russian tourism official, who felt his plight was like the character played by Tom Hanks in 2004 film The Terminal, that he was rescued from his ordeal. Steve said: “I slept in an chair in the waiting room. I washed my face and hair in the restrooms. I ate the cheapest food at airport diners. “I do not speak Russian, so I could not earn any money here.”  He pleaded from help from the British consulate and was lucky to find a sympathetic friend in the St Petersburg tourist information bureau. Ilya Tarashkevich said: “Steve approached me and asked how a foreigner can receive a money transfer. He did not have a card, and the bank did not work with foreigners. “My colleagues and I were puzzled. Soon I realised that the only way was to use my card.” He took pity on a man labelled an “alien” who “had not eaten for three days”.  Ilya said: “I thought what should happen in a person\u0027s le to make this happen. “Then Beard also said that he was afraid that he would be banned from entering the country again . “The most important thing in his le is his child. I am a father myself, so I understand him. “Then I decided to help Steve.” The consulate needed scans of all his documents. Ilya said: “There are no copy centres at the airport so I ran around the offices of cellular operators and asked: \u0027Do you remember the movie Terminal? I have a person here with the same story. Help me to scan the documents\u0027.”  This led to a court appearance where Steve was fined 5,000 roubles - around \u0026pound58 - but the judge understood his plight and overruled a demand to have him expelled from Russia after he had paid his fine. Expulsion - which could bar him ing in the near future - would violate the human right to a family le, the court ruled. Specically the judge decided that his son’s rights to be with his father were more important than expelling him for failing to renew his residence permit on time. Steve is now preparing new documents allowing him to reenter Russia after he s from his trip to Britain.

In the images, Carley Valikoula puts her arms around her daughter, Leilani, and lts her from the womb, instead of leaving it to doctors. The 36-year-old nurse had felt deprived when she could not give birth naturally, and delivered Leilani via maternal assisted caesarean section. She has now told of the incredibly emotional moment doctors guided her hands and she lted her daughter out of her body.  Carley, of Karratha, Australia, who needed emergency caesareans for her other children, Thomas, now eight, and Jacob, now five, said: “I had what\u0027s known as a maternal assisted caesarean section, and I would 100 per cent do it again. “A caesarean section is definitely not the easy way out. It’s very hard to do, and I’d never judge someone for having one. I’ve had three, but it was always really important to me to try for a vaginal birth. “I didn’t like the thought of my baby being taken away, patted down and handed around all these medics until eventually, I, the mum, got to hold them. I wanted to be able to pull them up onto my chest right away.” Following a textbook pregnancy with her eldest, Carley and her husband, John Valikoula, 44, a supervisor at an engineering company, were shocked when her waters broke at just 36 weeks in September 2010.  When her labour barely progressed for two days, fearing things were moving too slowly and posing a risk to mum and baby, doctors decided to perform an emergency caesarean. “I was really disappointed,” Carley admitted. “I’d been excited at the idea of a natural birth. I never thought there would be any issues, or that I’d be in the position of needing an emergency caesarean.” Then, in 2012, Carley fell pregnant with Jacob and was once again determined to attempt a vaginal delivery. She added: “This time, I planned it all from the start. I found a doula - a type of birthing partner - an independent midwe and even a photographer, as I wanted a home birth.” But, when in January 2013, Carley went into labour, once again, things moved slowly after her waters broke.  Twenty-four hours later medics decided that the safest course of action was to whisk her to hospital for another emergency caesarean. She said: “My team were all gutted for me, but I made my peace with it. I know that, while I wasn’t sure I could handle another caesarean, it was the best thing to do for my baby. “The actual surgery side of things didn’t bother me, but I wanted that moment where my baby is born and I pull them close to me right away. “Of course, every woman must do what’s right for her, and I would never take issue with somebody else’s choice. There are ious reasons a person may opt for a caesarean section and it’s certainly not the easy way out.” Carley had read about maternal assisted caesarean sections – where the mum pulls the baby out herself – online during her pregnancy with Jacob but, as her procedure had been an emergency, it had not been possible.  But, after he was born, the idea played on her mind. Then, in 2016, she fell pregnant again, sadly miscarrying at just 11 weeks, going on to discover around six months later that she was expecting Leilani. She said: “I decided this time, I wouldn’t try for a vaginal birth. I just wanted my pregnancy to be a nice experience and to know what I was expecting. “I was worried that my waters would break early and I’d need another emergency caesarean – meaning it couldn\u0027t be maternal assisted – so, in the end, I opted for an elective caesarean instead. “It meant I knew from the start what was going to happen.” Initially, Carley planned to have Leilani at a hospital in Perth, Australia. But, after discovering they did not allow photographers into theatre, she found a private obstetrician instead.  She said: “I want other women to understand their birth rights, and feel empowered to ask for exactly what they want. It can be hard to do but remember that any choice throughout birth is completely yours. “Find that right person to help and be steadfast in what you want.” In March 2017, at 39 weeks pregnant, Carley arrived ready to welcome little Leilani into the world. Heading down to the operating theatre, she recalls being nervous – but supportive John was by her side the entire time, helping steady her breathing. As they made their first incision, doctors put up a screen. But, around five minutes later, they lowered it to enable Carley to deliver her daughter. She recalled: “I’d had an epidural, so I couldn’t feel any pain – more just pressure and a tugging feeling. “I had surgical gloves on, and the doctors guided my hands down, then I put them under Leilani’s arms and lted them above my head.

committee agreed to a recommendation from director Elaine Zwirlein to spend £653,212 renewing PVC weathering boarding to the vertical edges of roofs.She explained the works comprised the renewal of existing timber weatherboard cladding finishes to existing monopitch- tiled roof structures on 38 homes at Murrayfield Gardens.She confirmed that none of the properties was on the council’s demolition programme for Whitfield.The work is due to begin in October with completion expected in March.Ms Zwirlein said that funding for the project was available in the housing revenue fund budget.The

records","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSchool records of historical interest have been lost.Elisabeth Kerr has been working to organise a school reunion for people who were at one of the two Lawside Academy campuses between 1961 and 1965 – the year they were all moved to one building.Elisabeth, who left Dundee in 1976 and is now living in Bristol, has primarily been using social media to organise the event, which is scheduled to take place in September next year.However, her attempts to trace other ex-pupils through school records has failed as the council has lost them.In an email exchange, the authority’s children and families services told Elisabeth there is “no information held by the archivist” on the school.In the exchange, it is claimed “several boxes that formed much of the history of the school” were packed up to be sent to the city archivist when the school closed in 2008 but did not make it to their destination.One of the emails sent to Elisabeth read: “I am of the view that the materials were potentially disposed of by mistake.“I have no way of verying whether they reached Tayside House or the archivist’s office, but I am clear that they are certainly not there now.”Elisabeth said: “It is extremely sad that there are no records relating to what was an incredibly important educational establishment within Dundee – the only Catholic academy school which drew in pupils from Perth, Blairgowrie, Arbroath and all places in between.”Elisabeth expects at least 70 people to attend the reunion, but she is trying to track down “more than 300” names she has already managed to unearth.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundees paul mcgowan weve not been good enough and need to change that against hibernian","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee’s players, it’s time to produce the goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united defender freddy frans not worried about falkirks artificial pitch","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter two full seasons in the Championship it is clear being big fish in a small pond has been of no benefit to Dundee United.And that is something Freddy Frans is well aware of with the defender insisting they have to fight to win points in a league where the pressure is always on.Since their relegation from the Premiership in 2016, United have twice fell in the campaign-closing promotion play-offs and currently lie fth in the table after a sticky start.They travel through to Falkirk today to face a Bairns side managed by ex-Terrors boss Ray McKinnon, something which could add an extra element of pressure for Csaba Laszlo’s team.However, 29-year-old Frans insists that is something they must learn to cope with while picking up the points.“That’s one of the reasons why I wanted to play for Dundee United,” he said.“I wanted the pressure. I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baa14a3a5de1.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee can get out of this mess theyve done it before","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOn the whole, no points by this stage of the season brings about relegation. Dundee will be hoping they can buck the trend – and they do have some form for it.Try to recall horric starts in the top flight for clubs – St Mirren in 2014, Livingston in 2005, Hamilton 1989, Dumbarton 1984 and Morton 1987 – and they all end in the same horror show of the drop.In 2014, the Buddies had to wait till their sixth game before picking up points, ending in bottom spot with 30 points. Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inniss calls on dundee team mates to show character after seventh straight defeat","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRyan Inniss has told his Dundee team-mates to look within themselves and find the fight that will rescue boss Neil McCann from the sack.The Dens Park boss is clinging on to his job after a seventh straight defeat against Hibernian on Saturday.The 3-0 loss to Neil Lennon\u0026#8217s men means the Dark Blues have yet to take a point from their six Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures so far this season.Now next week\u0026#8217s trip to Hamilton is looking like a make-or-break showdown for McCann\u0026#8217s reign \u0026#8211 so long as Dee chiefs do not decide to act before then.With so much hanging on that clash, Crystal Palace loanee Inniss knows his side cannot lie down as meekly as they did against Hibs.But the centre-back says it is down to his new colleagues to find the desire that will halt their slide \u0026#8211 not their manager.He said: \u0026#8220We will go again but we have got to take it personally, I mean really, really personally.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re talking about character here \u0026#8211 not ability.\u0026#8220For me, you find your level with ability eventually.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

It is another step towards where we want to be.“When you are not at your best it is still important to pick up points and win games.“That is where we are at the moment.“We have stayed quiet and have only lost once this season and that was when playing for 87 minutes with 10 men.”The tie went to penalties after the sides were locked at a 0-0 stalemate after extra-time.In the shoot-out captain Graeme Shinnie netted the opener before Stevie Mallan was denied by a superb save from Joe Lewis.Gary Mackay-Steven and Hibs’ Vykintas Slivka both scored before Niall McGinn’s spot kick was saved by Adam Bogdan to make it 2-2.After that Bruce Anderson, Stevie May, Chris Forrester and Scott McKenna scored for Aberdeen with Hibs also converting their spot kicks.Then Aberdeen secured a semi spot when Agyepong hit the crossbar.McInnes said: “We practiced penalties on Monday and I was confident with each of them that they would score.“I had seven volunteers to take the first five which is always pleasing.“With a keeper like Joe Lewis you always feel confident.“When it comes to taking penalties there’s a mental strength and a technique required.“I’m delighted my team showed the bravery, courage and technique to get the job done.“There’s enough good about us to get results but we’re still looking for that slickness and attacking threat.“When you go on a cup run, there are moments when you look back and resilience and a bit of luck is all it takes sometimes.”The semi-finals will be played on the weekend of Saturday 27 and Sunday 28 October.Aberdeen will discover their opponents when the draw is made following the tie with St Johnstone and Celtic at McDiarmid Park tonight.McInnes said: “We will deal with the semi final when it comes round and with whoever we get.“In extra time there wasn’t a lot happening as it was two tired teams still trying to win the game.“We tried to be as positive with our substitutions as we could and we ended up with Niall McGinn, Gary Mackay-Steven, Bruce Anderson and Stevie May at the death in the last 10 minutes trying to get something.“But also with the intention of having as many good penalty kick takers still on the pitch as well  it went the full distance.“Hibs don’t often not score at Easter Road, I can’t remember the last time they didn’t.“When you play good teams it is all about getting the balance right between attacking and defending.“We are delighted we have managed to find a way to win the game and come through.“It is another clean sheet for us against good opposition.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons bottle clear to see","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen proved they have the bottle to add to their 2014 League Cup trophy success by holding their nerve at Easter Road.Hibs created the most chances in a tense quarter-final but that will not be remembered when the Reds run out at Hampden on the weekend of October 27-28.Ultimately all that matters in cup competition is progressing.The result is primary, even  it is 6-5 on penalties, performance secondary.Aberdeen had the organisation, fitness levels, discipline and ultimately the nerve to come through what at times was a Hibs onslaught.Last season the Dons triumphed in a Scottish Cup quarter-final penalty shoot-out at Kilmarnock only to crash to Motherwell at Hampden in the semi. This time it must be hoped they use this as a catalyst to push on.Triumphing in penalty shoot-outs is all about having the belief and confidence to bury the ball and the skill to do it.Aberdeen have been Scotland’s second best team for the vast majority of the five and a half years McInnes has been at the helm.They have secured four runners-up finishes in the Premiership but there is only the solitary League Cup trophy triumph in 2014 from that period.For all the plaudits for the consistency of finishing second trophies are what fans want, and what are remembered.Aberdeen are now just two wins away from silverware and will unlikely face a tougher challenge than Hibs away.It was the Reds who created the opening chance in the third minute when Andy Considine’s shot from 10 yards out hit Mark Milligan before being scrambled away.Soon after the dangerous Florian Kamberi rounded keeper Joe Lewis only to shoot into the side netting.Then Emerson Hyndman skewed a 15-yard shot wide before Gary Mackay-Steven followed suit by firing off target.Following impressive play, on-loan Manchester United striker James Wilson was fouled by Mark Milligan. From the free-kick Dom Ball curled a superb 25-yard effort that rattled the crossbar and bounced inches from the line.It should have been the catalyst for an Aberdeen onslaught but instead it was the home side who controlled the rest of the half.In the 36th minute Martin Boyle, who had a goal chalked off minutes earlier for hand ball, burst past Max Lowe into the box only to blast wide with the goal beckoning.Hibs were turning the screw and Lewis saved from Shaw at the near post in the 42nd minute with Kamberi then shooting over soon after the break.The increasingly busy Lewis produced a superb, and brave, close-range block at the near post to deny Hanlon.As the high tempo continued Wilson fired in a low left-footed 30-yard drive but Bogdan comfortably saved.Hibs should have gone ahead in the 85th minute when Shaw was played clean in by Hyndman but he blasted wide.In extra time it was the Dons who wasted glaring opportunities when substitute Stevie May was played through the offside trap by Chris Forrester. May hesitated with his shot before firing it across goal and wide.Moments later McGinn missed an even clearer opportunity when through only to blast over.Hibs were denied in the 104th minute when a flicked header from Ryan Porteous was cleared off the line by Considine.The penalty drama was played out in front of the vocal Aberdeen fans in the South Stand.Captain Graeme Shinnie comfortably netted before Lewis superbly saved from Stevie Mallan.It was all square when McGinn’s spot-kick was saved.

The legal limit is 22mcg.And yesterday Elrick was back in the dock over a separate incident less than two weeks earlier on June 13.This time she admitted driving with 106mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath on the town’s Craigs Road.Defence agent Les Green, representing Elrick, said his client was taking steps to address her alcohol consumption.He said: “She tells me she’s not drinking any more and is attending AA meetings.”Sherf Sukhwinder Gill told Elrick, whose address was given as Mackie Avenue, Tarves: “It’s your third conviction for drink-driving. I’m going to call for reports.”She deferred sentence on Elrick until next month for a social work report and restriction of liberty assessment.She had her bail continued, but was disqualied from driving in the interim period until sentencing, despite already having been banned.There was no Crown narrative of events given at this stage in proceedings.However, during the last case in July, the court heard concerned motorists had alerted police after witnessing Elrick swerving across the road and clipping a kerb on Station Road on June 25.Sherf Philip Mann banned Elrick from driving for three years, ordered her to be supervised for one year and to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.On that occasion fiscal depute Cheryl Clark said: “The accused was seen at about 5.10pm on June 25 by a couple who saw she was travelling in front of them.“They were concerned about the manner of her driving.”Ms Clark said Elrick was seen to sway around the road at about 40mph and “clip the kerb”.She added her driving had “caused other motorists to take evasive action”.Witnesses contacted the police who traced the vehicle to an address and found Elrick inside.Ms Clark said: “Police spoke with the accused. She appeared upset and smelled strongly of alcohol.”Defence agent for that case John McLeod said: “This lady has had a real problem with alcohol.“She has sought help in the past and is currently again seeking help.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for dualling a96 to go on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOptions for dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Huntly will go on display from next month.A number of potential routes have been developed to dual the 26-mile section between east of Huntly and the city, with one controversial option seeing the road run near Bennachie.A series of public exhibitions are being held from October 8 for a week to let the public and road users see and comment on these.The identication of these options follows initial design and assessment work, along with consideration of feedback received to date.Scottish Transport Minister Michael Matheson said: “The Scottish Government has given a clear commitment to dual the A96 which will see delivery of around 88 miles of upgraded road between Inverness and Aberdeen, a huge task but one we are committed to delivering.“As part of that work, we are taking forward the design work for the stretch of the route between east of Huntly and Aberdeen and next month we will let people see the options we have developed for this challenging section of the A96.“I would encourage anyone with an interest in this scheme to visit one of the exhibitions from October 8 to 11 and give us their views.“The vital feedback we receive will help inform the design and assessment work as we look to identy a preferred route option next year.”Last week, campaigners from the Save Bennachie group visited Holyrood to promote their bid to preserve the popular north-east beauty spot, which they believe is threatened by the road.One of the options Transport Scotland is considering would see the A96 encroach on Bennachie, along the foot of the hill.During the visit, group members spoke to Mr Matheson.Save Bennachie member Margaret Garden said the road undoubtedly needs upgrading, but options that do not threaten the landmark should be considered.She said: “We want to protect this outstanding landscape for generations to come.“Our grandchildren, and their grandchildren, will not forgive us  we allow it to be spoiled on our watch.”Public exhibitions will be held on Monday October 8 and Tuesday October 9 at Inverurie Town Hall.The designs will also go on display at Stewarts Hall in Huntly on Wednesday October 10 and at Kinellar Community Hall in Blackburn on Thursday October 11.All exhibitions run from noon until 7pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"praise for aberdeen university after rise in good university guide","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university named the best in Scotland has been praised in parliament.Aberdeen University has been named the Scottish University of the Year in the Good University Guide.It jumped from 40th spot last year to 26th in the UK list.North East region MSP Tom Mason asked his Scottish parliamentary colleagues to support the university in its future endeavours.He said: “Aberdeen’s universities have a long tradition of academic excellence along with a reputation for welcoming students from all over the world.“It is gratying to see Aberdeen University’s commitment recognised in this way and I hope it will give the other shortlisted UK institutions a run for their money.”Principal Professor George Boyne called the award “a testament to the efforts of our staff and students”.Mr Mason’s motion has asked to congratulate the university on its award.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/KMil_Penguin_Auct-17.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"maggies penguin parade auction 540000 raised for charity at va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOver half a million pounds has been raised for charity at the Maggie’s Penguin Parade auction in Dundee.A packed audience at the V\u0026ampA gasped in delight as the £539,000 total was announced following frantic bidding for the 82 lots on offer. 100vw, 620px\" /A donation of £1000 from the floor rounded the total figure to £540,000.\u0026nbspAfter a summer of bringing joy to families across Tayside and Fe, the Maggie’s Penguins went under the hammer at V\u0026ampA in front of an audience of around 300 people.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kim jumping for joy after lifting gold as best of british","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA talented young gymnast from Aberdeen picked up a gold senior medal at a major event in Birmingham.Kim Beattie, of Banchory Trampoline and DMT Gymnastics Club, claimed top spot in the hotly-contested senior women’s DMT category at the 2018 Trampoline, Tumbling and Double Mini Trampoline British Championships.Beattie, pictured, clinched gold with an impressive score of 134.200.She said: “I feel amazing.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone. He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review. She added: “An important aspect of reviewing the service is to ensure that we can continue to deliver increasingly complex chemotherapy treatments to the highest standards possible, taking account of all relevant clinical evidence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13310145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_200918dog2JPG.jpg","title":"dog mad couple dress up","story":"NewsDog-mad couple dress up pet in a KILT for Ayr wedding dayAnimal-loving Lisa and Robert Irvine knew their beloved West Highland Terrier, Bobby, had to play a key role in their big day.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson08:44, 26 SEP 2018Updated09:18, 26 SEP 2018NewsLisa and Robert with pet pooch Bobby \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dog-mad couple have walked down the aisle with their pet pooch.

Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13285958.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS163197665.jpg","title":"three things learned ayr united","story":"NewsThree things we learned as Ayr United prepare for Rangers test by going top of the ChampionshipThe Honest Men warmed up for a crack at Rangers in midweek by moving to the summit of the Championship with a comfortable 2-0 win at Alloa.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson21:12, 22 SEP 2018NewsLawrence Shankland \"Get Rangers updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHigh flying Ayr United continued their dream start to the season by going top of the Championship today. Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon pensioners 900 mile solo","story":"NewsTroon pensioner\u0027s 900-mile solo effort for charityGeorge Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie12:46, 25 SEP 2018Updated09:39, 26 SEP 2018NewsGeorge reaches Land’s End as he crosses the finish line \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner with an articial knee has cycled almost 900 miles in the name of charity. George Dunlop, from Troon, pedalled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer. The 68-year-old cycled from John O’Groats to Land’s End and despite having an articial knee and suffering a puncture at Birmingham, George completed the cycle in 19 days. Cancer survivor George said: “I had never forgotten the help Ayrshire Cancer Support gave me getting to hospital, and I wanted to  the favour. “The cycle was hard going but I had something in my system that refused to give in. “I did it all on my own, without back-up, and it was a tremendous. “I cycled on canals and old railway lines and, to make up time, sometimes on busy roads.” George lived in Fenwick until 2015 and, following the passing of his we, moved to Troon.  Having been diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and survived the illness, he was motivated to complete the series of climbing all of Scotland’s 282 Munros. When given the all-clear, he had taken up cycling to regain full fitness and continues to cover many miles on two wheels each week. Laura Brown, income and marketing manager for Ayrshire Cancer Support, said: “Despite not liking to ask anyone for money, George collected \u0026pound300, including \u0026pound130 on the road during his arduous cycle the  of the UK. “I’m sure when people know that he has undertaken this huge cycle in aid of Ayrshire Cancer Support, they will be only too delighted to dig deep and show their support. “We are grateful for the support of all fundraisers, whose generosity is crucial to the services we provide for those affected by cancer. “George pulled out all the stops to benefit Ayrshire Cancer Support and it is thanks to him that we can continue supporting families all across Ayrshire affected by cancer.” People can donate to George’s appeal by sending cheques or donating directly to Ayrshire Cancer Support at 22 Wellington Square, Ayr.

Mark Crane insists the rising star from Buckinghamshire will curb his temper during this week\u0027s clash in Paris. It comes as the spotlight shines on Europe\u0027s underdogs and their ability to perform against a formidable American line-up. But Crane, who has proved a lethal partner for Hatton since taking his bag earlier this year, believes Hatton will thrive in the Paris pressure cooker. He said: People have a perception of Tyrrell from the TV and view him as a fiery character. Away from that he\u0027s actually quite dferent and we get on incredibly well, which is why it works on the course. He wears his heart on his sleeve and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. I guess I\u0027m there as the calming influence! The pair have joined forces to register top ten finishes in the US Open and PGA Championship this season. And Crane, 36, who runs Prestwick\u0027s Bar Central, is expecting another big performance. He said: Everyone is tipping the Americans but I’m not sure why they’re favourites. The Europeans know this course well and being accurate off the tee will be vital. Do the Americans have a formidable looking team? Sure. But we also have plenty of guys at the top of their game and it\u0027s going to be an incredible contest.  The appearance marks Crane\u0027s second Ryder Cup, following his debut in 2016 at Hazeltine carrying the bag of Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Barassie greenkeeper Kerr Rowan is among an army of 180 course staff working at Le Golf National. The 39-year-old, now a course manager in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “It’s a huge honour. “Any golf fan would give their right arm to be involved in what is the pinnacle of our sport. “The rough is long and will undoubtedly favour the Europeans. “But you look at the line-up coming across from America and have to say they are worthy favourites.” Kerr, who grew up playing Royal Troon, has been drafted in by friend, Alejandro Reyes, who is course manager at the Ryder Cup venue. Kerr said: “This will be the second Ryder Cup I’ve worked at and nothing compares to the event. “I’m on holes two, three, 13 and 14 and some of the stuff they’ve done with the course is incredible. “It’s been totally stripped back and rebuilt just for this week.” The event kicks off on Friday and is live on Sky Sports from 6.30am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRyder CupTroonPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"runners-step-up-for-innerleithen-family-5k-run","story":"RUNNERS laced up once again for this year\u0027s family 5k fun run in Innerleithen on Saturday.\nThe crowds of entrants met on the shared pathway at the gate opposite the town\u0027s Health Centre at 1.45pm to register and hand in their sponsor money ahead of main event kicking off at 2pm.\nThe 5k route ventured up and down the Tweed Valley Railway path and took in the picturesque River Tweed.\nAnd despite the number of runners being down from the record total of 50 who took part last year, a good afternoon was had by all involved.\nCerticates were also awarded to all participants.\nA spokesperson from the run said: \"Well done to everyone who took part in our family 5k.

sphere lamp now glows above the architecture of Robert Adam, the interiors of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and glassware of Christopher Dresser, as well as artwork from the Beano cartoonist David Law, early computer games and even a pair of Hunter wellington boots.\nThe 55-year-old former Galashiels Academy pupil is delighted to have been included in the collective story of great Scottish designs.\nNeil told the Border : \"This is such a great honour.\n\"The people from the V\u0026ampA contacted me about six months ago and they wanted to me to supply all the background to how the lamp was designed.\n\"It is suspended right in the middle of the new permanent gallery - and from the time I\u0027ve spent here in the gallery it is getting a lot of attention.\n\"This is a most impressive building and I\u0027m pleased to be part of it.\"\nNeil graduated from Napier University in 1985 with a degree in Industrial Design after his schooling in Clovenfords and Galashiels.\nHe celebrated by collecting the Product Designer of the Year Medal from the SIAD Chartered Society of Designers.\nThree years later Neil gained his Masters degree in design at the Domus Academy in Milan.\nAfter relocating to Paris in 1991, he began to specialise in the design of \u0027deceptively simple-looking mass-produced objects\u0027.\nAnd there has been a steady flow of awards for his technology and lighting designs ever since.\nNeil\u0027s Scopas light, which was designed for Italian manufacturer Artemide, has already won awards in Europe and the USA.\nThe apparently incomplete suspension lamp is ever changing in its appearance, depending from where it is viewed.\nAnd it breaks the mould of monotonous forms that normally characterise this kind of central lamp.\nAs well as hanging in the new V\u0026ampA Museum, an interactive screen next to the exhibit allows visitors to deconstruct the Scopas design.\nNeil added: \"The virtual screen allows people to take the lamp to bits and then rebuild it on the screen.\n\"There have been schoolchildren taking my lamp to bits for most of the morning, which has been fun to watch.\"\nAs well as Neil\u0027s Scopas Lamp, the Scottish Design Galleries features a wide range of furniture, textiles, metalwork and ceramics, to fashion, architecture, engineering and digital design.\nJoanna Norman, Lead Curator of the Scottish Design Galleries, told us: \"The influence of Scottish design is not limited to one country, it has been felt around the world .\n\"Drawing on the V\u0026ampA\u0026rsquos world-famous collections of art, design and performance, it has taken several years of careful research to establish this unique collection of objects which together will tell a fascinating and relatively unknown story.\nAfter attending the opening of the V\u0026ampA last week in Dundee Neil spent the weekend at the family home in Clovenfords before ing to Paris this

very best of what the Scottish Borders has to serve up.\nBetween a food fayre, chef demonstrations and charity dinner, there was something for everyone to appreciate across the Local Food on Local Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is made from scratch in Hawick, using malted barley grown in the Borders.\nProfessional chefs \u0026ndash Jacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell from The Sisters Restaurants, Glasgow, Amanda Jordan of the Firebrick Brasserie, Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students. It made sense to use as much local produce as we could.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a natural menu that reflects this part of the countryside, and my style of cooking.\nFiona Richmond of Scotland Food and Drink praised the evening\u0026rsquos menu, describing it as \u0026ldquoabsolute perfection.\nAnd David Cochrane, Chief Executive of HIT Scotland, who attended the dinner on behalf of the receiving charity was also enthusiastic.\nHe told us: \"The quality and passion behind the food tonight really put Scotland on the map and of that we\u0026rsquore really proud.\nHe also talked of the challenges of recruiting, and the essential practice of attracting people to the industry by showcasing the opportunities that are available and how up to date skills need to be developed, which is where scholarships really come to the fore.\nDinner guest Will Haegeland, deputy general manager of Cringletie House Hotel, is actively working to encourage increased tourism to the area as part of his role as Chair of the Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership.\nHe said: \"Food and tourism are key growth sectors in the Scottish Borders, and there aren\u0026rsquot many others.\n\"We have a chance to increase visitor numbers and bring new resources \u0026ndash we need to see more young people choosing hospitality as an industry of choice.\n\u0026ldquoIt is an exciting industry to be a part of and this is a great type of event to showcase that. We need young people to be showcased more and to demonstrate their pride in their work.\nIt is hoped the Local Food on Local Plates showcase will become an annual event in the Borders College calendar.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"trial-dates-set-for-nursery-workers-accused-of-cruelty","story":"TWO nursery workers from Duns have been accused of forcibly dragging about children in their care and locking them inside cupboards.\nNicola Jeffrey, who is 22, and 34-year-old Teresa Renton are charged with behaving in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause a reasonable person fear and alarm on ious occasions between January 1, 2015, and August 1, 2016.\nThe offence is alleged to have been committed at Little Reivers Nursery in Duns, which has since closed.\nThey both pleaded not guilty at Jedburgh Sherf Court to a charge of shouting, forcibly dragging children about and lting them off the floor by the arm, as well as locking children inside cupboards and refusing to let them out.\nThe charge also relates to making offensive and abusive comments towards and about young children, and behaving in an aggressive, threatening and abusive manner towards young children in their care.\nJeffrey is further alleged to have seized hold of the arm of an injured child who was receiving treatment from a colleague and it was later ascertained the arm had sustained two fractures.\nJeffrey is also said to have changed the nappy of a child in a public place in view of the public on a concrete floor without using any mat.\nRenton of Ainslie Terrace and Jeffrey of Rachel Drive, both Duns, pleaded not guilty to the charge.\nTwo days have been set aside for a trial at Jedburgh Sherf Court on October 25 and 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"biker-michael-meets-the-men-who-saved-his-life","story":"A BORDERS biker has met with the two paramedics who saved him.\nMichael Hallsworth was left fighting for his le after a horror crash near Kelso in the summer.\nThe 64-year-old retired electrical supervisor smashed into a roadside telecom box after being knocked from his bike.\nAs well as suffering broken ribs and a broken shoulder, the dad-of-two also punctured a lung.\nHe was saved after a fast-acting team from the Scottish Ambulance Service managed to re-inflate his lungs at the scene, allowing him to breathe.\nMichael spent six days in hospital recovering from the crash.\nHe told us: \"When I woke up in hospital the next day, the doctors said  not for the intervention of the paramedics, I would not have survived.\n\"I was told my lung had collapsed and they had saved my le.\"\nMichael was speaking for first time about the horror crash after meeting up with the Scottish Ambulance Service team of Guy Anderson and Stuart Hogg \u0026ndash both based at Kelso Ambulance Station \u0026ndash that saved his le.\nHe continued: \"I was on my way to Hawick when I came past the racecourse at Kelso.\n\"That is the last thing I can actually remember but apparently just past there, I overtook a car and the car turned right into me and knocked me off.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned

Of those, a third said their conditions were work-related stress.\nThe absence level for women \u0026ndash 15.4 days \u0026ndash remained higher than that for men \u0026ndash 10.9 days.

\u0026ndash 5.8 days \u0026ndash than staff who had been employed for two years or more \u0026ndash 13.2 days.\nNISRA noted that around half of the staff employed for under two years would have been on probationary terms and conditions, which include more stringent management of sickness absence.\nPublic service union NIPSA blamed the management of the civil service.\nNIPSA general secretary, Alison Millar, said: \u0026ldquoAfter last year\u0026rsquos report we raised with NICS management the need to do more to address in particular the level of illness due to anxiety, stress, depression

continue to make cuts, attack terms and conditions, change how people work and pile on more pressure whilst totally failing to address the root cause of the problem.\n\u0026ldquoThe report considers

collection of artefacts belonging to an Argyll airship captain and First World War submarine hunter has landed in Kintyre.The \u0026#8216Air Ace of Argyll \u0026#8211 Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.

Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.

She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

The youngster has been playing since he was just five years old.  The two coaches put the Dunbar Primary School pupil forward because of his good attitude and commitment to the sport.  The trip to Glasgow\u0026rsquos Emirates Arena, where Great Britain won 3-1 with Norrie, ranked 70 in the world, winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 to settle the encounter, gave Ben a taste of the big time, with the youngster playing in the East Lothian Open earlier this summer.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.  In August,Yard of Ale played a fundraiser for Musselburgh Athletic Football Club to help them achieve their transition to senior football.

Designed on his iPad and set in Hockney\u0026rsquos Yorkshire birthplace, it reflects the Queen\u0026rsquos love for, and connection with, the countryside.  Hockney was commissioned to create the window to celebrate the Queen\u0026rsquos reign.  The brightly-coloured abstract window of yellow, red, blue, pink, orange and greens, features\u0026nbsphawthorn blossom and stands out in its historic setting.  Hockney told the Press Association that the iPad was \u0026ldquoa natural thing to use because it is\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoback-lit like a window.  The much-loved artist, who recently broke his own auction record with a \u0026pound21.1 million painting, said that designing his first stained glass window \u0026ldquowas a challenge\u0026ldquo adding: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove learnt something about glass.

Hockney once said that he turned down the chance to paint the Queen because he was \u0026ldquovery busy painting England actually, her country.  Asked whether he had any response to the window from the monarch, who has not yet seen the finished result, he said: \u0026ldquoNot yet, but I hope she\u0026rsquoll like it.

Hockney,\u0026nbspfamous for both his Yorkshire landscapes and paintings of Calornian le,\u0026nbspwas inspired by Matisse, Chagall \u0026ldquoand a few other people for the new work.  He was asked to design something symbolic or representational, rather than a figurative design.  Westminster Abbey said that the result \u0026ldquoreflects the Queen as a countrywoman and her widespread delight in, and yearning for, the countryside.  The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall told the Press Association: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom excited by it.  \u0026ldquoI think there\u0026rsquos absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and dferent.  \u0026ldquoSome of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautul, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be here until the end. I mean, who knows what\u0026rsquos going to happen in the future! The Abbey\u0026rsquos only been here just over 1,000 years. It\u0026rsquoll be thousands more.  He said of the Queen: \u0026ldquoShe\u0026rsquos obviously seen a sketch but she\u0026rsquoll see it in person when she\u0026rsquos here in November.  \u0026ldquoYou wouldn\u0026rsquot necessarily get very much reaction out\u0026nbspof the Queen. She absorbs things. But she\u0026rsquos also I think quite trusting.  Barley Studio, a stained glass studio based in York, created the window using traditional techniques.  Helen Whittaker, from the studio, said of working with Hockney: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting because he takes risks. A lot of people have an idea of what a stained glass window looks like \u0026ndash religious wallpaper that doesn\u0026rsquot engage.

The 13-day average was up from the 12.5 recorded the previous year and was the highest rate since 2008/09.  NISRA said the total absence, in salary terms, equated to an estimated \u0026pound33.8 million of lost production \u0026ndash equivalent to around 4.0% of the total NICS pay bill in 2017/2018.  The 13 days equates to 6.0% of the available working days in that 12-month period.  Just under half of the 20,000-plus workforce \u0026ndash 47% \u0026ndash had no recorded absences in the year, while more than one in eight had at least one spell of long-term absence, lasting around three months on average.  NISRA said that was highest level of long-term absence recorded in the last five years, accounting for nearly three quarters of all working days lost.  Anxiety, stress, depression and other psychiatric illnesses accounted for the greatest proportion of working days lost \u0026ndash 36%. Of those, a third said their conditions were work-related stress.  The absence level for women \u0026ndash 15.4 days \u0026ndash remained higher than that for men \u0026ndash 10.9 days. NISRA said more than half of that dferential was linked to gender-specic conditions.  Within government departments, the Executive Office had the lowest absence rate \u0026ndash 7.6 days \u0026ndash while the Department for the Communities had the highest \u0026ndash 15.4 days.  The statisticians found that those who had been in post for under two years had a much lower level of sickness absence \u0026ndash 5.8 days \u0026ndash than staff who had been employed for two years or more \u0026ndash 13.2 days.  NISRA noted that around half of the staff employed for under two years would have been on probationary terms and conditions, which include more stringent management of sickness absence.  Public service union NIPSA blamed the management of the civil service.  NIPSA general secretary, Alison Millar, said: \u0026ldquoAfter last year\u0026rsquos report we raised with NICS management the need to do more to address in particular the level of illness due to anxiety, stress, depression and psychiatric illness  \u0026ldquoWe offered to work jointly to see what could be done, in response we were told all that could be done was being done.  \u0026ldquoThis is not the case, management continue to make cuts, attack terms and conditions, change how people work and pile on more pressure whilst totally failing to address the root cause of the problem.  \u0026ldquoThe report considers ious figures and factors, including that mental health issues account for 36% of absence and within that category work-related stress accounted for approximately a third of the days lost.  Ms Millar condemned what she described as \u0026ldquohype around the annual publication of the report.  \u0026ldquoEach year the NI Statistics Agency is allowed to issue a report that is based on data only and not informed by the true reasons that lie behind the data, she said.  \u0026ldquoNICS management do not comment on the report, as they know only too well that they carry the responsibility for a workplace that fails to properly assess the problems and fails to protect staff from the harm caused by applying continuous additional pressure on staff with less resources.\u0026nbsp It is time for NICS Management to properly engage with NIPSA to improve the working environment.  She added: \u0026ldquoIt is time to stop this annual ritual of a witch hunt against civil servants and for the civil service and others to understand that the pressures on civil servants both economic and workplace pressures are the cause with the resultant adverse impact on health and morale.  \u0026ldquoRather than taking the current approach and being focused on ill-informed target setting I again call on the management to sit down with NIPSA to seek real and meaningful resolutions to the causes of ill-health in the workplace.  A Department of Finance spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe increase in the level of sickness absence across the service is disappointing.  \u0026ldquoWith a workforce of over 20,000 the reality is that people are going to get sick and 86.5% of working days lost during this period were covered by a medical certicate.  \u0026ldquoIt is important for context to acknowledge that just under half of our staff 46.6% had no recorded absence in 2017/18.  \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos report recognises that a higher than usual number of people suffered from cold, cough, flu, influenza over this 12-month period.  He added: \u0026ldquoReducing sick absence remains a priority for all departments and it is vital that work on this area continues.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge for the NICS is to ensure all staff have the necessary health and wellbeing support at the right time in the right place."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8730828.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coroner-questions-allergen-labelling-rules-at-pret-sandwich-teenagers-inquest","story":"  Dr Sean Cummings spoke out at an inquest into the death of\u0026nbspNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, who collapsed on a British Airways flight from London to Nice in July 2016 after\u0026nbspsuffering a fatal reaction to a Pret A Manger sandwich.

The inquest at West London Coroner\u0026rsquos Court has heard that food safety regulations allow businesses which produce food on site to provide reduced allergen\u0026nbsplabelling compared with factory-made products.  Mrs Saunders said: \u0026ldquoI think the distinction was made really to deal with small, independent high street premises which perhaps prepare food on site and put it into a bag to sell to customers coming in.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe regulations make no distinction with Pret, with their huge turnover.  Dr Cummings said: \u0026ldquoIt seems a little strange a local sandwich shop could benefit from that regulation but an organisation that sells 218 million items  should also benefit from that regulation.  \u0026ldquoYes, I would agree, said the witness.

That was in 2012 when she was 61 and had ed to Scotland to retire after 40 years in Canada.  The gran-of-six was referred for tests and, aged 63, was told she had a 10 per cent memory loss at that stage.  In 2015, following further tests, she was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia.  Recently, Olive, who previously managed a care home, completed a mammoth trek to raise money for pioneering research.  On May 1 Olive started walking the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through France and northern Spain with her husband, Ronnie, for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK.  Walking a minimum of 10km each day, the couple took two months to complete the 780km route \u0026ndash a month quicker than planned.  She said: \"I was looking for ideas for something we could do to raise money.  \"There are some things I can\u0026rsquot do, but I watched the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, where they trek the Comino de Santiago route, and I thought \u0026lsquoI can walk, let\u0026rsquos go for that\u0026rsquo.  \"The trek was very tough, but we got stronger and stronger each day.  \"The hardest point was early on when we both got sick.  \"Because we were focused on walking, we didn\u0026rsquot realise how ill we were. We had to stop and rest for three days.\"  Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes reduced.  It\u0026rsquos estimated to affect about 150,000 people in the UK and is rare in people under 65.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

The troubled project was put on a \"pause\" last March when it was facing spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a hill, in a major public park, under a listed building and close to a major railway line.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the gallery space.  It will open in early 2021.  : When Galleries pressed \u0027pause\u0027 on revamp project  The galleries have long wanted to change the display of Scottish art at the National Gallery, which for many years was shown in a \"cramped and dark\" concrete basement.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street, and are often busy, especially during the Festival.  The new galleries, with large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \"broader\" look at Scottish art, and will open in 2021.  : Stop and start history of landmark revamp project  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter and the Scottish Colourists S J Peploe and F C B Cadell.  The plan will involve \"extensive new landscaping in the gardens\", as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \"dedicate family day\" one daya a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, followed by a new coffee shop at Christmas, and new steps and paths by next spring.  Funds for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5,5, as well as signicant fund raising.  : Director previously hoped for 2020 re-opening  Sir John Leighton, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said: \"This is a hugely exciting time for us, as we see our ambitious plans for the Scottish National Gallery getting underway.  \"We will create the perfect showcase for the nation\u0026rsquos extraordinary collection of Scottish art, giving it room to breathe and showing it off with real pride to the world.  \"This ambitious project will completely transform the experience of our visitors, creating a National Gallery that is even more open, engaging and inviting with new presentations of Scotland\u0026rsquos art in a setting that will be truly world-class.\"  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said that visitor numbers to the Scottish National Gallery have almost \"doubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.\"  She added: \"Soon, visitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of innovative displays designed expressly to engage them.  \"Imagine looking at a painting of Sir Walter Scott and then looking out of the windows into Princes Street Gardens, a landscape created during his letime and which is now dominated by the great monument marking his international fame.\"  : Sir John Leighton on national gallery\u0026nbsprevamp plans  The designs for the revamp are by Hoskins Architects.  The main entrance will be to Princes Street Gardens.

He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  Len McCluskey, the union\u0026rsquos leader, has made clear that he believes the 2016 Brexit vote should stand and there should not be a rerun to keep Britain in the EU. He too wants to see a general election to get rid of Theresa May\u0026rsquos Conservative Government.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  Sir Keir\u0027s comments departed from the text of his speech and was at odds with Mr McDonnell\u0026rsquos view.  But, earlier, the Shadow Brexit Secretary sought to play down the split, claiming it did not exist and that the Shadow Chancellor\u0026rsquos initial assessment could be put down to having been \"up early\" for his interviews on Monday, just hours after Labour\u0027s policy motion was thrashed out in Sunday night\u0027s marathon meeting.  Explaining Labour\u0027s strategy for the looming Commons showdown on whatever deal Mrs May brought back from Brussels, Sir Keir said there was \"ision, chaos, failure\" under her premiership and \"the Government has no credible plan for Brexit, weeks out from the deadline\".  He told conference: \"The Tory civil war on Europe that has been going on for years now risks our prosperity.  \"The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down, declared Sir Keir.  \"So, I\u0027ve got a message for the Prime Minister:  your party wants to tear itself apart, that\u0027s fine\u0026hellip but you\u0027re not taking our country with you.\"  He noted that it was \"increasingly likely\" that whatever plan Mrs May brought back to the Commons would fail to meet Labour\u0027s tests for a Brexit agreement and  so \"we would vote against her deal\".  Labour would also vote down a \"vague\" deal, a so-called \"blind Brexit\" that did not spell out details of the future relationship.  \"This is not about frustrating the process it is about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit,\" insisted Sir Keir.  He refused to accept that the only option available  Mrs May\u0027s plan were voted down was a no-deal Brexit.  \"No deal would be a catastrophe and no government has the right to plunge our country into chaos because of their own failures,\" declared the Labour frontbencher.  Under the terms of the motion set to be voted on late this afternoon,  Labour could not force an early general election, it would \"support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  The possibility of another referendum after 17.4 million voted to leave the EU has led to fears of civil unrest and the rise of far-right politics.  But Sir Keir said that that could be avoided and the party had a responsibility to save the UK from leaving without a deal.  Ahead of his speech, he told BBC Radio 5 Live a no-deal Brexit would \"rupture our trading arrangements and this will cost jobs, I don\u0027t doubt that the pound will begin to drop\".  The Shadow Brexit Secretary explained: \"We won\u0027t have any arrangements for security and counter-terrorism - I worked, when I was director of public prosecutions, on counter-terrorism work across Europe - the idea that we wouldn\u0027t have an arrangement in place for that would horry people,\" he said.  \"And, frankly, this idea that we might have medicines stockpiled for six weeks has spooked people.  \"We don\u0027t want to face that situation and we have got a duty to do something to stop it and that\u0027s why the option of a public vote is important as something that may have to happen when we get to that stage.\"  Acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue, Sir Keir said: \"We have to manage it in a sensible way but we have to accept we are only having this discussion because of the failure of the talks.\"  Labour\u0027s position leaves the PM brutally exposed to a rebellion by restive Tory backbenchers, with fewer than a dozen able to fracture her fragile control of the Commons in the upcoming vote.  The Shadow Brexit Secretary confirmed talks were taking place with potential rebels, telling the BBC: \"If we get to that stage this autumn, most MPs would be prepared to say: \u0027We need to do something to prevent us crashing out of the EU without a deal.\u0026rsquo\"  In response to his conference speech, Eloise Todd for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: \"Keir Starmer\u0027s speech has put staying in the EU firmly on the table.  \u0026ldquoAfter an unprecedented grassroots effort mainly from Corbyn\u0026rsquos supporters, Labour look set to back a public vote should an election not happen. The delegates should listen to the standing ovation that accompanied Keir\u0026rsquos words and confirm the motion this afternoon.  Gerard Batten, the UKip leader, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer is another member of the Remainer elite who thinks he knows better than the people. I will remind him that five million Labour voters also voted for Brexit.  \"Labour, Liberal or Tory, it\u0027s clear that  people want Brexit, then they will have to vote for UKIP at the next General Election.\"  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for Labour to stop playing games and finally nail its colours to the mast with a genuine alternative to a Tory extreme Brexit.  \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos shameless \u0026lsquoman without a plan\u0026rsquo political posturing is simply not good enough. It is a total absence of leadership on the biggest issue facing the country and it shows Labour is not fit for opposition let alone government.  The party\u0026rsquos Europe spokesman went on: \u0026ldquoUnbelievably, Labour still appear to back the harmful fundamentals of a Tory hard Brexit dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will and causing huge damage to jobs and the economy by taking the whole of the UK out of the single market and customs union, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.  The Fe MP added: \u0026ldquoWith just six months to go before the UK crashes out of the EU, it is staggering that Labour have failed to outline a clear alternative to the Tories and continue to pursue a reckless path that they know will destroy jobs, damage businesses, and inflict lasting harm on the incomes and living standards of millions of people\u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoIt is time Labour ditched their support for a Tory hard Brexit and joined the SNP in standing up for the interests of the country.  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer has confirmed Labour would break their promises and take us back to square one on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIn the space of one morning, he has refused to rule out delaying Brexit, refused to confirm Labour would end freedom of movement, and opened the door to staying in the EU with a second referendum. Labour\u0026rsquos promises on Brexit aren\u0026rsquot worth the paper they\u0026rsquore written on.  \u0026ldquoLabour can\u0026rsquot deliver the change the British people voted for and it\u0026rsquos only the Conservatives who have a plan to take back control of our laws, borders and money, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-pledges-land-reform-to-end-dominance-of-feudal-private-landlords","story":"  The Scottish Labour leader in his keynote conference speech also made clear his party in power would give more state aid to Scottish businesses instead of foreign-owned companies.  The self-styled Corbynista insisted that society should \u0026ldquostop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.  He insisted the \u0026ldquoreal ision in Britain was not between Scotland and England but between the wealth owners and the wealth creators.  Deriding the Tories\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquofervent devotion to inequality and the Nationalists\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquotimidity and mediocrity, the Central Scotland MSP said it was time for \"moral courage and audacity\" from Labour and proposed a wealth tax on Scotland\u0026rsquos wealthiest 10 per cent, which, he calculated, would raised \u0026pound3.7 billion for public services.  On land reform, he said Labour had unfinished business and that after abolishing feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament the nation was still living with \u0026ldquofeudal ownership with 432 private landowners owning half of privately-owned land in Scotland.  Describing the earth as a \u0026ldquocommon treasure, he insisted what was needed was land ownership in Scotland for the many and not the few.  A Scottish Labour government would introduce a new Land Reform Act to break up the dominance of private landowners and will look at the possibility of introducing a tax on land value, capping the amount on landowners\u0026rsquo beneficial interest and a residential requirement on absentee landowners.  Mr Leonard also pledged to overhaul state aid for business, Regional Selective Assistance[RSA], to provide more support for local industries and home-grown businesses after the crisis with marine energy company BiFab, which left communities facing ruin as hundreds of workers were threatened with redundancy earlier this year.  He party leader stressed how reform of RSA would prevent foreign-owned companies continuing to benefit from nearly twice as much RSA than Scottish companies.  In his speech, he also promised that the next Labour manesto would oppose another independence referendum and called for a \u0026ldquofederal Britain with more powers for the Scottish Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-nation-is-stuck-in-a-climate-of-endless-division","story":"  Politically, it\u0026rsquos like being trapped in the Hall of Mirrors of a demented Fun House run by evil clowns \u0026ndash everywhere you look the same ghastly reflection stares back at you, and in the reflection there\u0026rsquos you and a snaking line of humans, vanishing into the horizon, queuing, grey-faced and defeated, to vote in a poll we all know is just a staging post towards yet another damaging X on the ballot paper. And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion. Change happens, it always does, but over these last years we wanted to light a fire under change, to turbo-charge its engine \u0026ndash all we\u0026rsquove really done is blow the bloody doors off the car."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-dont-like-immigration-better-stick-with-the-union","story":"  Take the SNP. The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"turning-glasgow-on-to-health-benefits-of-vegetables","story":"  A lack of fruit and vegetables in our diet has been identied as one of the major causes of serious illness, yet Glasgow\u0026rsquos consumption of vegetables in some areas is falling at an alarming rate.

The proposals are part of a five-point plan to revive town centres and stem their decline following the dficulties faced by a string of major retailers.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Our high streets need saving from a slow and agonising death.  \"As part of our plan to rebuild Britain and breathe le back into our communities, Labour will scrap ATM charges, deliver free WiFi to town centres, introduce a register of empty properties, provide free bus travel for under 25s and overhaul the broken business rates system which is hammering retail.  \"Boarded-up shops and deserted high streets are a result of years of neglect and austerity. Our country needs to radically change course so our towns can thrive again,\" she told conference.  The high street has been battered this year by several high-profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.  House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have shut stores.  Meanwhile, on the issue of cash machines, there have been widespread closures of ATMs with cuts to funding resulting in the loss of thousands of machines rural areas and Scotland have been the worst affected.  Labour pointed out how the number of people who relied almost entirely on cash had risen to 2.7 million, up by 500,000 over the last two years.  Research by Which?, it said, had shown that the loss of free-to-use ATMs would leave one in 10 people struggling to make payments, forcing consumers out from local shops and services.  Labour analysis has found that in the last three years alone 100,000 jobs in the retail sector have been lost. British Retail Consortium research also shows that a fth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.

He once referred to the concrete, subterranean galleries, opened in 1978, as \u0026ldquoan enduring weakness.  : More details and images of the revamp at the Galleries  Now, 12 years later, and after at least one false start - and accompanied by a \u0026pound5m rise in cost - the redevelopment of the National Gallery will begin next month, a three year project costing \u0026pound22m, to be completed by 2021.  The project was put on a \u0026ldquopause last March when the galleries\u0026rsquo first plan faced spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a man made hill, in a major public park, under an A-listed building and above one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major railway lines.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the entire gallery space.  The changes from the first plan mean that the new gallery spaces will stay not extend the facade five metres into East Princes Street Gardens, as previously planned, although it will feature a newly revamped entrance and pathways.  Sir John said he is confident that more than \u0026pound10m in funding, yet to be announced, can be secured.  : How, after a rethink, new National Gallery will be made  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat we have now is fully contracted price, and  we had pressed ahead with the original scheme, it would have been considerably more than \u0026pound22m.  \u0026ldquoSo we took the dficult decision to revise the project and recast it, and personally I think what we have now is a stronger concept.  Sir John added: \u0026ldquoThe rest of the cost comes from fundraising, and we have a substantial amount of that already, so I am confident that will be able to raise that. There is a signicant amount in already, and there is somewhere to go.  He added that he was \u0026ldquovery confident the project would be completed on budget.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street.  For the next two years the traders who work in the route to the Playfair steps during the Festival will not be present.  The new galleries, with six large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \u0026ldquobroader look at Scottish art.  : How the \u0027pause\u0027 in revamp\u0026nbspwas revealed in 2017  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter, Raeburn and the Scottish Colourists Peploe and Cadell.  The plan will involve \u0026ldquoextensive new landscaping in the gardens, a large lt for art and people, as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \u0026ldquodedicate family day one day a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, with new steps and paths by next spring.  : Arts News on Bloody Scotland success  Funds announced for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5.5m.  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said visitor numbers to the gallery have almost \u0026ldquodoubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.  She added: \u0026ldquoVisitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of displays designed expressly to engage them."},{"url":null,"title":"emily-thornberry-condemns-sickening-individuals-exploiting-legitimate-support-for-palestine","story":"  The admission came as the Shadow Foreign Secretary reiterated Labour\u0027s commitment to recognising Palestine - which Jeremy Corbyn has said would be done \"as soon as we take office\".  Ms Thornberry also condemned the Israeli Government\u0027s \"racist policies and criminal actions\" as she gave her keynote speech in Liverpool.  She said: \"We all support the Palestinian cause, we are all committed to recognise the Palestinian State, and I stand here with no hesitation when I condemn the Netanyahu government for its racist policies and its criminal actions against the Palestinian people.  \"But I know as well, and we must all acknowledge, that there are sickening iniduals on the fringes of our movement, who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people, and their desire to see Israel destroyed.  \"Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party the same way Oswald Mosley was kicked out of Liverpool.\"  Ms Thornberry was speaking after a debate on Palestine saw one speaker defying the chair to whoops, cheers and scores of Palestine flags being waved in support.  Delegates chanted \"Free Palestine\" as a motion condemning the Israeli response to protests in the Gaza Strip was moved by Colin Monehen from Harlow CLP.  He said an \"army\" would be needed to remove him from the stage, prompting cheers and claps from many in the audience, after he was told his speaking time was up.  He said: \"If you want me off this stage, you\u0027re going to have to get security up here and they better send an army, because Eastenders, like Palestinians, don\u0027t go down easy.\"  Mr Monehen said the Palestinian people could not be \"left alone in the darkness\", saying their story \"must be told\".  He went on: \"I want us to send a message to Mr Trump that cutting the funding to the UNRWA, the humanitarian agency set up by the UN to assist these people in exile, born homeless, born stateless, in refugee camps, will not crush their spirit.  \"It will not lessen their resolve to  home. Expelling Palestinian diplomats will not make them disappear like a snowflake in the hot sun,\" added Mr Monehen.  The debate happened after the Labour leader threw his support behind a two-state solution to Middle East peace, saying he wanted a \"secure and viable\" Palestine alongside Israel.  Addressing the Labour Friends of Palestine conference fringe event, he attacked Donald Trump for moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and cutting funding for the UN Refugee Agency.  He also called for a \"sustainable, just peace\" with Israel after \"51 years of occupation\".  Mr Corbyn went on: \"But peace cannot be achieved with the existence of settlements, human rights abuses, and a disregard for international law by the current Israeli government, like last Sunday\u0027s demolition of the Palestinian village of Khan Al Amar.  \"The security of one country can never be achieved at the expense of another and Britain has historic responsibility towards Palestinian people, declared the party leader.  He added: \"We will continue to stand up for Palestinians, we will recognise an independent state of Palestine as soon as we take office.\"  At the same fringe meeting, Ms Thornberry echoed the party leader, saying an independent Palestine was needed, \"while there is still some Palestine left to recognise\".

In other words, Remain will not be an option in a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  David Mallon from Blyth Valley said he would have voted Remain in 2016 but was now against it as the EU was a \"capitalist club\" using free trade to \"take advantage\" of eastern Europeans. He was cheered but before he left the staged gave Jezza big hug.

Almost one in five  of those living in the worst off areas had been worried about running out of food over the last year \u0026ndash with 21% of single parents reporting this as a concern.  The findings from the 2017 Scottish Health Survey, which for the first time included questions on food insecurity, also found 7% ate less than they should and 4% did run out of food.  Earlier this year calls to top up child benefit by \u0026pound5 a week and lt 30,000 youngsters out of poverty were rejected yesterday by the Scottish Government.  Campaigners had wanted the SNP to write the measure into new social security laws, using newly devolved powers.  But in a vote the party rejected Labour\u0026rsquos amendment.    Scottish Greens health spokesperson Alison Johnstone MSP said it was time for the Scottish Government to rethink their refusal to top-up Child Benefit.  \"It\u0026rsquos appalling that in wealthy 21st century Scotland we have so many people either worrying about running out of food due to lack of money or actually going hungry because they\u0026rsquore strapped for cash,\" she said \"The impact of poor nutrition on people\u0026rsquos physical and mental health is well understood, and it\u0026rsquos particularly detrimental to children\u0026rsquos development.  \"I hope in light of the new findings on food insecurity SNP Ministers think again about a \u0026pound5-a-week top-up of Child Benefit and finish the job on mitigating the Benefit Cap, to ensure families no longer go hungry.  Almost 3,700 adults and just over 1,600 children across Scotland took part in the 2017 survey \u0026ndash with the findings showing increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.  Nearly one in four ate the recommended five portions a day, the highest total since 2003 \u0026ndash although the figures also showed that 10% had not consumed any fruit or vegetables on the day prior to the survey being carried out.    But on average adults in Scotland consumed 3.3 portions of fruit or vegetables, against the highest since 2003, with children 2.9 portions on average \u0026ndash the best since 2008.  The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.  This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone.  The report said there was a \u0026ldquosignicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017, noting that 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.  Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change \u0026ndash a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.  Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: \u0026ldquoThese statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn\u0026rsquot facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.  \u0026ldquoThe figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry. We know low wages, zero-hour contracts, frozen benefit levels and the introduction of Universal Credit are pushing more and more people to the brink.  \u0026ldquoWhen so many people are struggling to make ends meet you know something has gone badly wrong with the system.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why our political leaders must urgently fix the system, in our rich country no-one should be constantly worrying about how they\u0026rsquore going to feed their kids. We can do better than that. Everyone should be able to access the money they need to put food on the table.  A Scottish Government spokesman: \u0026ldquoNo one should experience food insecurity in a country as prosperous as Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are directly challenging the causes of food insecurity by promoting the living wage and embedding a rights-based approach in our new social security system.  \u0026ldquoWe continue to challenge the UK Government\u0026rsquos punitive welfare policies and continued austerity, which takes money out of the pockets, and food out of the mouths, of the most vulnerable in our society. We expect to spend \u0026pound125 million this year alone in mitigating UK Government welfare measures.  \u0026ldquoWe have increased our Fair Food Fund to \u0026pound1.5 million this year, rising to \u0026pound3.5 million next year, to reduce and over time remove the need for food banks."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-blames-procurement-process-on-flu-jab-shortage","story":"  Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick told MSP that NHS National Service Scotland ordered its vaccine before expert advisers recommended changing to a new strain.

And he will say that Labour is ready to deliver \u0026ldquothe radical plan we need to rebuild and transform Britain, telling delegates: \u0026ldquoThe old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  Mr Corbyn will say Britain needs a government \u0026ldquocommitted to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training, and will promise large-scale public and private investment in wind and solar power, as well as subsidies to make all homes energy-efficient.  The insulation programme alone would create 160,000 jobs alone spread across the UK.  Changes to planning guidance will aim to encourage private investment to double onshore wind power over 12 years, while offshore wind will be increased sevenfold and solar power threefold.  \u0026ldquoScotland would clearly benefit extensively from this level of investment in terms of jobs and living standards, and it is something that would be very welcome in Scotland, stressed the Labour leader\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos speech comes at the end of a four-day conference which has been dominated by Brexit but has seen the Labour leader and shadow chancellor John McDonnell set out a range of policies to reverse inequalities in wealth and economic power.  These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.

He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  After the Brexit debate, delegates approved by a show of hands the proposed motion, which, in the event of the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plan failing to get MPs\u0026rsquo support, called for a general election with the option of a second referendum  one did not happen.

More than 1,800 people have taken part in a major consultation so far, voicing their opinion on efforts to boost the area’s recycling rate and reduce the volume of material sent to landfill.                                                     A package of changes is being proposed, including reducing the size of non-recyclable bins, increasing each household’s recycling capacity and improving the network of Household Waste Recycling Centres, closing some smaller facilities.                                                    Two options to change kerbside waste collections are proposed as part of the revamped collection system and people are encouraged to share their views with the council on this.        Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%. Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.Sending waste to landfill costs twice as much as recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.                                                                                                        Chairman of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee , Peter Argyle, said: “Clearly a signicant number of people have already given their views and as councillors we will of course take those into account when making what are important decisions about how we all deal with the waste we produce. “There are however around 118,000 households in Aberdeenshire who will be affected by these changes, so we’d be keen to have as many of their views as possible too.” ISC vice chair, John Cox, said: “Recycling and waste services will be used by just about everyone who lives in this area, so any changes to that service will of course have an impact. “Anyone who wants to have their views included as we make decisions on how services are delivered should spend a little time learning about what’s proposed by participating in the consultation.”                                                                                                         Take part and give your views on the package of proposals here.

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, 128 tonnes of plastic bottles are incinerated every year.Here in Orkney, OIC\u0026#8217s waste team will be carrying out a number of activities including a drop-in at Tesco on Monday, visits to local schools, as well as sharing recycling information and tips on its Facebook and Twitter feeds.The team will be also be encouraging local people to take part in the Scottish Government’s national consultation on a deposit  scheme on disposable drinks containers for Scotland.OIC’s project coordination manager for waste, Jayne Venables, believes that small improvements in Orkney’s recycling rates could make a huge dference.She says for every one per cent extra material that is recycled, the council can save up to £12,500 on waste disposal costsIain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland added: “Recycle Week is the ideal opportunity to do more to make sure we’re recycling as much as we can. We all use plastic bottles in our daily routines — from shampoo and shower gel, to cleaning products —which can all be widely recycled, and it doesn’t take long to do.\u0026#8221You can also follow activity and share messages throughout the week on the Eco Active Orkney and/or OIC updates Facebook pages or using #RecycleWeekScot on Twitter.More information on deposit  and Recycling Week is available on the Zero Waste Scotland website at: www.zerowastescotland.org.uk\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgWednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch. And at Nigg, an abandoned kayak, plastic pieces and a large rusting boat were found.For more details about the project visit www.scrapbook.org.ukWednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

How would you react  Scotland became known as the slow man of Europe? The tag represents a novel twist on the albatross which has hung around our neck for decades, yet the notion of a nation plodding meekly on while its neighbours rush by does little to inspire a sense of progress. \u2028The presumption that proceeding at an unhurried pace is as good as going backwards has been one of the defining responses to the private member’s bill put forward by Mark Ruskell. The Green MSP is spearheading a change in the law that would bring about a 20mph speed limit on most roads in built-up areas. So far, it has been supported by dozens of MSPs, and Mr Ruskell said he has held positive discussions with Michael Matheson, the transport secretary.            A private dialogue is not the same as a public endorsement, and it would be premature to read Mr Ruskell’s proposal as a done deal, especially given the opprobrium his bill has inspired. The Alliance of British Drivers - owners of the snappy motto, ‘Don’t let them drive you out of your car’ - has declared 20mph areas as a “waste of money, or worse,” while Jamie Greene, the Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, dismissed Mr Ruskell’s idea as “ham-fisted” arguing that the current targeted approach of designated 20mph roads, carried out in consultation with the public, represents the best way forward.             Such arguments against sweeping, mandatory changes to the way we drive may sound familiar to motorists of a certain age. There was a time when the RAC, asked for its views on one of the most signicant road traffic policies in generations, railed against the suggestion it should be compulsory. “The time for consideration for such a drastic measure has not yet been reached,” it implored. “Strict enforcement would have undesirable effects on relations between police and public, many of whom would justiably resent prosecutions and convictions.”The issue at play was the introduction of seat belt legislation. The year was 1973. Halcyon days, indeed. Such a harrowing snapshot from the history books ought to provide encouragement to Mr Ruskell and his supporters. Their argument is wedded to any number of indisputable facts, the most convincing being a slew of research which shows that reducing the speed limit not only curbs the likelihood of accidents occurring in the first place, but drastically reduces their severity and, with it, the chances of people being killed.             Yet the inability to question such data has not prevented opponents of the bill from seizing upon other data to bolster their cause. Some have pointed to datasets produced by Transport Scotland as supporting evidence in the hope of having the legislation dismissed as a punitive and disproportionate step. Out of the 7,138 reported road accidents in Scotland, they point out, just 293 involved drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit, resulting in 23 fatalities. Such numbers, the argument goes, constitutes a small proportion of the number of accidents - and deaths - on Scotland’s roads. Statistically, this is indisputable, but the brevity of the counter argument is even more compelling. It goes something like this  you think 23 deaths is an acceptable price to pay for drivers travelling too fast, you are an idiot.In any case, trying to shape policy around  road traffic accident statistics is a near impossible pursuit. A rushed, selective reading of Transport Scotland’s bevy of spreadsheets would likely inspire the more excitable of our elected representatives to call for drastic change.             Nearly as many motorcyclists  are killed each year as there are pedestrians , but is that alone reason for a clampdown on the two-wheeled? Of course not. Close to 2,000 more male drivers are involved in accidents than women, but should we ban all men from getting behind the wheel? Well, it is tempting,  only for the possibility it may spark the spontaneous combustion of Jeremy Clarkson. The awkward, cloying reality is there is no one-size fits all policy approach that will address these issues, and that applies to the speed limit question. A 20mph limit is not suitable for all suburban roads, and it is important to recognise there are sparsely populated roads which serve as crucial arteries. Indeed, Mr Ruskell’s bill recognises this, and would grant local authorities powers to exempt ious roads from the 20mph limit. Scotland has a commendable record in reducing the number of road fatalities and serious accidents. In 2006, there were 293 deaths. That number plummeted to just 175 in 2016, despite the fact the intervening decade saw an increase of around 350,000 licensed vehicles.             But progress cannot invite complacency, not when there are so many other lives that could be saved. The majority of us are drivers, and a similar proportion, I like to think, are reasonable, considerate people. Yet these two welcome facts are not always compatible.Provided Mr Ruskell can navigate his bill through Holyrood, its success will likely depend on an advertising blitz to raise awareness and bring about attitudinal shts. It happened in 1967 when the first drink driving limit was introduced, and again in 1983 when front seatbelt wearing regulations became mandatory. One day, I hope, Scotland will take pride its slow man of Europe, but will it take time and perseverance. Just ask the tortoise.          \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4805443.1537950486!/image/image.jpg","title":"pensioners to miss out on flu jab due to procurement blunder","story":"        Half a million Scottish pensioners are set to miss out on an updated flu jab this winter available in England, due to a procurement blunder.

Should this require more time to negotiate a workable solution, then so be it.: Theresa May: It’s my Brexit deal or no deal at all“Extending the Article 50 negotiation period – but maintaining the same transition timescale to 2020 – may be unpalatable for some but could be essential to protect jobs and livelihoods.”While the Fraser of Allander Institute said it expected economic growth of 1.3 per cent this year for Scotland, followed by 1.4 per cent  in both 2019 and 20202, it stressed there was a  “heightened degree of uncertainty” about forecasts at the current time.            “Our forecasts are based upon a broad-based agreement between the UK and the EU,” the report said.“Should this not happen, then our forecasts are likely to change signicantly.”The report was published after MSPs debated the impact of Brexit on trade. Scottish trade minister Ivan McKee said Holyrood and the Scottish Government must have a say in the deals, but claimed he was not demanding any vetos over them.The minister continued: “The Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament must have a guaranteed role in all stages of the formulation, negotiation, agreement and implementation of future trade deals.”            He denied Scottish Conservative claims this means the Scottish Government is seeking any vetos over UK-wide trade agreements.Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said: “The Scottish Government has consistently argued that the best option for Scotland is to stay in the EU or, failing that, to stay in the European single market or customs union, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.“But we should not be faced with a choice between no-deal and a ‘blind Brexit’, with no signicant detail on future trade relationships. That means – as the First Minister has called for – that an extension to the Article 50 period must be on the table, and we welcome the Fraser of Allander Institute support for that position. This report could not be clearer about the economic harm and chaos which could ensue from not reaching a deal.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"knab heritage centre graham johnston ","story":"The Shetland Classic Car Club proposes that a Shetland Heritage Centre should be established among the remaining unused buildings on the campus at the Knab .\nIn the case of the classic car club we immediately need a large room in which to catalogue and archive our huge collection of Shetland-related motoring material.\nThe club has also identied the need for a permanent showcase, or exhibition space, in which everything available to it  can be made accessible to inform, educate and entertain the Shetland public and visitors to our isles.\nThese heritage-based activities would in our view fit very well into the historic listed buildings of educational origin on the AEI campus.\nWe\u0026#8217re aware of a very wide network of Shetland heritage bodies and artefacts which would also benefit from such a heritage centre. The many local history groups, genealogy societies, history researchers, local museums and indeed the reserve collection of the Shetland Museum and Archives would all benefit from a hub and showcase in which to come together to work and exhibit artefacts.\nThis would be a tremendous asset for Shetland, would provide synergies between all those involved in the heritage field, and would be an excellent way to use some or all of the remaining buildings.\nWe believe that the marginal costs of this proposal could be largely offset by rents paid by occupants and by admission charges paid by the visiting public.\nShetland Islands Council convener Malcolm Bell has been kind enough to refer this proposal on to the project team which is managing the consultation process on the future use of these buildings.\nOur initial soundings have indicated that a Shetland Heritage Centre at the AEI campus would be warmly and widely welcomed.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nWednesday 26 Sep 2018 12:43 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving.

Michael explained how the runaway success of his creation has seen views of up to 900,000 on the page, and that his characters are now set to come to le at the Waterfront in October.\n“I grew up with three older sisters, I’m the only boy and the youngest so a lot of my inspiration has come from my family, I’ve seen and heard it all,” he laughed.\n“The Facebook page has become so successful that it makes you want to do more, keep creating, keep entertaining people. I remember when I posted the first video and people were commenting underneath saying ‘more, more’.”\nMichael’s only foray on the stage so far was “when I was in Primary Seven in St Kevin’s and I wore my mummy’s white skinny jeans to play the Angel Gabriel,” he laughed.\n“I feel brilliant that I’m going to be performing all the characters for the first time at the Waterfront. I’ve never seen anything like this, like the following the site has, it’s crazy, but good crazy,” he said.\nThe show will be directed by Alan McKee, one half of comedic duo Grimes and McKee, and himself no stranger to the director’s chair.\n“Joe Rea, who is producing the show, spoke to me about Michael and said ‘this guy is very funny, I think there is a show here’. I ran Michael’s page past the focus group of teenage girls in my house and they loved it, there are plenty of songs and dance routines for everyone to take part in.\n“The fact we are putting on the show shows the power of social media, you can’t ignore that number of hits, that amount of likes and views.\n“Michael has a great ear, he writes exactly the way people speak, warts and all. He is a really original voice.\n“This is the first time I’m directing a piece that has come this way and it has really opened my eyes to look out for other things that don’t necessarily come via the traditional route,  it’s good people will pick up on it. It’s a version of word of mouth just how successful Belfast Girls has become which is the best publicity you can get.”\nBelfast Girls will be performed at the Waterfront from October 9-20.

At a crucial juncture in the Brexit negotiations it is hugely important that we sustain and build further links, cooperation and engagement across all of Ireland. I have no doubt the Seanad will be keen to hear what the Mayor has to say and continue to play our part in supporting the work of councillors across the country.\n\n“The memorandum between Belfast and Dublin city councils can act as a positive catalyst for cross-border relations and delivery. Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seb took his own life 5 days after cops","story":"\nA GLENGORMLEY couple who lost their son to suicide says the system is failing people with mental health issues.\n\n25-year-old Sebastian ‘Seb’ Haggan took his own le a month ago with a suspected heroin overdose.\n\nDad Billy and mum Sharon say they “tried everything” to help their son after he turned to drink and drugs before he took his own le after three previous attempts.\n\nSpeaking from the family’s Elmfield home, Billy told the North Belfast News how Sebastian’s le had spiralled out of control.\n\n“Sebastian had his mental health issues since he was a kid,” explained Billy. \n\n“He lost his baby brother Joshua in 2002 and then when his grandparents died, it hit him hard.\n\n“We were told he had to be re-assessed but at the end of the day, he was suffering from the same issues. He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast man wont face second trial","story":"\n\nA man\n who admitted preventing the lawful burial of his elderly neighbour will not face a trial for stealing a second bank card from her burgled flat.\nSentencing of Robert Sharkey, 24, originally of Larkspur Rise, will take place next month.\nHe was convicted of 11 charges, including using one of Marie Conlon\u0026#8217s debit cards to buy nearly £6,000 worth of pizza.\nA remaining charge of theft of a debit card will remain on the books.\nThe remains of 68-year-old Ms Conlon were discovered in the bedroom of her West Belfast flat off the Suffolk Road last October.\nSharkey – a neighbour at the time – was arrested and subsequently charged with preventing the lawful burial of a corpse on dates between August 2015 and October 2017.\nSharkey, now with an address at Grays Hill in Bangor, pleaded guilty to preventing her lawful burial and to breaking into her home and taking batteries, tools and a coffee mug, and also of stealing both £50 in cash from her, and a First Trust debit card.\nHe also entered guilty pleas to six separate counts of fraud by false representation,  namely using Ms Conlon\u0026#8217s First Trust bank card without authority to buy food totalling £5,988.39 from Domino\u0026#8217s Pizza over a period from October 2015 to 2017.\nHe also bought goods from Sainsbury\u0026#8217s to the value of £3,279.80 from July 2016 to October 2017, and purchased mobile phone credit amounting to £1,030 from March 2016 to October 2017.\nSharkey also admitted using the card to pay Power NI £285, as well payments to the Land and Property Service of £573.83 in September 2016, and £586.20 the following September.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The EU is insisting in the event of a no deal Northern Ireland remains part of the single market and customs union in order to ensure freedom of movement across Ireland. \n\nHowever, this has been rejected by the Prime Minister, parliament and unionists who say it will create a border in the Irish Sea effectively breaking up part of the UK. \n\nDan O\u0027Brien, chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs, writing in the Irish Independent, said a referendum may be the only way to \"legitimise\" whatever decision is eventually taken.\n\n\"It might let Leo Varadkar and Theresa May off the potentially career-ending hook that they are both now on,\" he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"civil service sick leave in northern ireland at highest level in ten years","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Of those, a third said their conditions were work-related stress.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe absence level for women – 15.4 days – remained higher than that for men – 10.9 days. NISRA said more than half of that dferential was linked to gender-specic conditions.\n\nWithin government departments, the Executive Office had the lowest absence rate – 7.6 days – while the Department for the Communities had the highest – 15.4 days.\n\nThe statisticians found that those who had been in post for under two years had a much lower level of sickness absence – 5.8 days – than staff who had been employed for two years or more – 13.2 days.\n\nNISRA noted that around half of the staff employed for under two years would have been on probationary terms and conditions, which include more stringent management of sickness absence.\n\nPublic service union NIPSA blamed the management of the civil service.\n\nNIPSA general secretary, Alison Millar, said: “After last year’s report we raised with NICS management the need to do more to address in particular the level of illness due to anxiety, stress, depression and psychiatric illness\n\n“We offered to work jointly to see what could be done, in response we were told all that could be done was being done.\n\n“This is not the case, management continue to make cuts, attack terms and conditions, change how people work and pile on more pressure whilst totally failing to address the root cause of the problem.\n\n“The report considers ious figures and factors, including that mental health issues account for 36% of absence and within that category work-related stress accounted for approximately a third of the days lost.”\n\nMs Millar condemned what she described as “hype” around the annual publication of the report.\n\n“Each year the NI Statistics Agency is allowed to issue a report that is based on data only and not informed by the true reasons that lie behind the data,” she said.\n\n“NICS management do not comment on the report, as they know only too well that they carry the responsibility for a workplace that fails to properly assess the problems and fails to protect staff from the harm caused by applying continuous additional pressure on staff with less resources.  It is time for NICS Management to properly engage with NIPSA to improve the working environment.”\n\n\n\nIt is time to stop this annual ritual of a witch hunt against civil servants...\nAlison Millar, general secretary of public service union NIPSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nShe added: “It is time to stop this annual ritual of a witch hunt against civil servants and for the civil service and others to understand that the pressures on civil servants both economic and workplace pressures are the cause with the resultant adverse impact on health and morale.\n\n“Rather than taking the current approach and being focused on ill-informed target setting I again call on the management to sit down with NIPSA to seek real and meaningful resolutions to the causes of ill-health in the workplace”.\n\nA Department of Finance spokesman said: “The increase in the level of sickness absence across the service is disappointing.\n\n“With a workforce of over 20,000 the reality is that people are going to get sick and 86.5% of working days lost during this period were covered by a medical certicate.\n\n“It is important for context to acknowledge that just under half of our staff 46.6% had no recorded absence in 2017/18.\n\n“Today’s report recognises that a higher than usual number of people suffered from cold, cough, flu, influenza over this 12-month period.”\n\nHe added: “Reducing sick absence remains a priority for all departments and it is vital that work on this area continues.\n\n“The challenge for the NICS is to ensure all staff have the necessary health and wellbeing support at the right time in the right place.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked

I regret not seeking an opportunity to declare this matter earlier in my employment,\" he said.\n\n\"I accept that some may have perceived this as a conflict of interest with my work as a special adviser in the DfE .\"\n\nHe stressed that he never discussed the application with Mr Rutledge, nor did he do so with other RHI claimants he knows.\n\n\"I did not encourage anyone to apply to the scheme, advise anyone to apply to the scheme or assist anyone in their accreditation,\" added Mr Robinson. \n\n\"I worked with Stephen Brimstone, who is a recipient. I became aware of his involvement in the scheme subsequent to becoming a special adviser.\" \n\nHe continued: \"Those who worked alongside me will testy that I always favoured more rigorous inspections, publishing of recipients\u0027 names and action to curb the costs of the scheme.\" \n\nMr Rutledge, in evidence published by the inquiry, has said: \"I had no contact with John Robinson about applying to the RHI scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any discussion about the scheme with John Robinson would have been as a result of news coverage about the RHI scheme.\"\n\nRHI had been due to close on February 16, 2016 but the inquiry has heard this week how there was a two-week delay, and it eventually shut at the end of that month. \n\nPoultry giant Moy Park, which benefited from the scheme, sent an email to company officials congratulating them on successfully lobbying to have it extended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked  he was aware of any lobbying, or  he could recall any instance where he felt \"influence or pressure\" being exerted on himself in relation to cost controls, Mr Robinson said the firm had sought to speak with the then Economy Minister Simon Hamilton in 2017.\n\nThis was when tarfs were being amended, added the former Spad. However, he revealed that \"conversation did not take place\". \n\n\"The minister asked the permanent secretary to deal with the matter. Prior to that, Mr Mike Mullan from Moy Park had sought to reach me via telephone but a conversation never took place,\" he continued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can recall suggestions being made to the minister as to how to reduce the cost of the scheme. This may have been through media comment or other correspondence.\" He also stressed that no one had \"directly\" raised concerns about the RHI with him, and  that had have happened, Mr Robinson insisted, he would have \"passed the information to the DfE permanent secretary\".\n\nMr Robinson specied that he first became aware of the scheme\u0027s flaws subsequent to becoming a Spad, through a \"departmental briefing with the minister\". \n\nHe added that he did not discuss RHI with Timothy Cairns, a special adviser to the Deti minister, beyond telling him about some criticism of the scheme he had received at a social  in early 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Robinson also denied \"influencing or encouraging\" Mr Cairns \"to delay, soften or reduce cost controls at any time\". And he denied asking anyone else to do the same.\n\nMr Robinson\u0027s brother-in-law and current DUP chief executive, Timothy Johnston, is due to appear at the inquiry on Friday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary. A referendum may be the least bad option now.\"\n\nMr O\u0027Brien suggested that the most likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations at present was the UK crashing out without a deal.\n\nHe suggested the blame for this almost entirely lied with the British side.\n\nHowever, he admitted: \"The decision by the Irish and EU side last November to demand of the British that they concede the principle that part of their sovereign territory - Northern Ireland - be removed from their customs territory was a major miscalculation. \n\n\"Perhaps it is because Europeans have shared the same customs territory for more than half a century that the signicance of the proposal was under-estimated.

He was raised on a diary farm and has two brothers who are chicken farmers but neither are involved with the RHI scheme. His father-in-law however, does have two boiler on the botched scheme. Mr Robinson said he never discussed the scheme with anyone and it was \"never on his radar\" prior to official briefings on the matter from DETI officials when he was a Spad and after the scheme\u0027s closure. \n\nMr Bell said he got the information from DUP Spad Timothy Cairns. Mr Cairns, however, denied this. \n\n\n \nFormer DUP spin doctor ‘regrets’ not declaring in-law a scheme recipient on taking Spad job\n \n\n\nAt Wednesday\u0027s RHI inquiry he said Mr Bell\u0027s revelations in the Assembly were \"incredibly hurtful\".\n\n\"I was as shocked as anybody,\" he said.\n\n\"My family were catapulted into a media spotlight they did not deserve.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said any move that would see Northern Ireland’s regulations dfer from the rest of the UK’s, likened to putting a border in the Irish Sea, would be a bad outcome.\n\nHer parliamentary allies, Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, are strongly opposed to such a scenario.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Chequers plan has been assailed by critics and Brexiteers have reiterated their support for finding a technological solution to the border.\n\nMr Varadkar said he had sought a lot of counsel in recent months from “wise old heads” who know Europe and know British politics and know Northern Ireland.\n\nHe added: “I came away from those meetings with the advice that it’s unchartered territory and unpredictable and do your best and I think that was probably the best advice I could have got.”\n\nMr Varadkar said Mrs May had reinstated her commitment to having a legally operative backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement while at an informal summit of European leaders in Salzburg recently.\n\nHe said: “And the EU 27 again in Salzburg gave their full solidarity behind Ireland and restated our position that there won’t be a withdrawal agreement at all, no transition period for the UK  there isn’t an Irish protocol, a legally operative backstop as part of that.”\n\nMeanwhile, during debate in the Irish Dail parliament, the Taoiseach touched on efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s stalled powersharing administration at Stormont.\n\nHe said: “I think clarity around Brexit could help.\n\n“Perhaps  by the October summit, or the November summit  there is one, we’re in a position to have a roadmap as to how Brexit going to work, what the new relationships are going to look like, we might be in a better position then to bring the parties together again.\n\n“Certainly the Government stands ready to do that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"coroner questions allergen labelling rules at pret sandwich teenagers inquest","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I wouldn’t like to speculate what the problem is, that’s the role of the inquest.\n\n“My job is to enforce the law as it stands and I did that five months before your daughter died.”\n\nThe teenager suffered from numerous allergies and reacted badly to sesame seeds “hidden” in the bread, which caused her throat to tighten and vicious red hives to flare up across her midrf, eventually triggering cardiac arrest.\n\nTwo epipens were jabbed into her legs, but the symptoms did not abate and she was declared dead the same day at a hospital in Nice.\n\nThe inquest is due to last until Friday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland squad to turn fully professional before world cup","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

About an hour prior to setting the first 4:55 time in history, Kosmic had tied the previous world record – held by a gamer called somewes – after 1,615 attempts, at 4:56.245.\n\nBut to reach 4:55 Kosmic had to attempt “an additional hard trick in level 1-2” something he had done before but never while on a perfect run. Fortunately for Kosmic, he not only nailed the trick after only nine attempts, but managed to maintain his superb run afterwards to claim the record.\n\n“By some miracle  played perfectly to 8-4, where I did lose a little bit of time, but it was enough to get a 4:55,” he told the Press Association. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this happened!”\n\n\nI\u0027m a little overwhelmed right now IF IM BEING HONEST\n— Kosmic  \nSeptember 25, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve such a record is the stuff of dreams for a gamer, but despite what was at stake it sounds as though the nature of the situation meant nerves didn’t play much of a part.\n\n“Since this was the very first run I had on this pace, there was no way in my mind it was going to be \nthe\n run,” said Kosmic. \n\n“That’s why I was cracking jokes the whole time. Even going into 8-3 I wasn’t that nervous, because there was just \nno way\n it was going to happen.\n\n“It happened so fast that I’ll continue going for a run that plays 8-4 slightly faster.

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods. We need to get this balance right and parents can make a start by reducing their own screen time.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor children aged 2-5, the weekday average was approx. 1 hour 49 mins and 2 hours 13 mins at weekends.  For over 5s, the weekday average was almost two hours rising to more than 3 hours at the weekends.\n\nCaroline Bloomfield, Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Senior Manager at the Public Health Agency said: “Ideally, under 2s should have no screen time while under 5s should have no more than an hour a day. For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens. This doesn’t have to be organised physical activity or sport and all movement counts.\n\nFor more information visit:\n \n\nwww.makeastart.org\n It provides lots of simple ideas on getting active in and around the home and ways to make a positive, healthy start.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry sinn fein mla disappointed lack progress new investment bbc ensure equal access gaelic games northern viewers","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney has expressed disappointment at the lack of progress and new investment from the BBC to ensure equal access to gaelic games for northern viewers. \n\nHe was commenting after a Sinn Féin delegation held a meeting with the BBC in Belfast. \n\nRaymond McCartney said: “Sinn Féin met with the BBC on Monday to once again voice our concern at the lack of televised coverage of gaelic games for viewers in the north. \n\n“We are disappointed that BBC have made absolutely no progress or new investment to ensure the quarter of a million gaels in the north have equal access to gaelic games. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“While we welcome the live coverage of the 12 Irish League games, this cannot overshadow the need for more coverage of the GAA which is the largest spectator sport on the island of Ireland. \n\n“Since launching the Fair Play for Ulster Gaels campaign we have heard the frustration felt among GAA fans at what they feel is decades of neglect by BBC in terms of televising and mainstreaming gaelic games.\n\n“We believe that a collaborative approach from sporting organisations and broadcasters is required to end the inequalities surrounding televised coverage and parity of esteem for northern gaels.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"litter loathing puppet reminds people derry keep city tidy","story":"\nPhoto Caption:  Jodie McAneaney, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul’s Live Here Love Here Manager, is pictured with the star of a new anti-litter campaign – a litter loathing puppet who pulls no punches when it comes to offenders!\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor gives backing recycling week urges local householders reduce reuse recycle","story":"\nHouseholders across Derry were reminded this week of the need to ‘Reduce, reuse and recycle’ as Recycling Week got underway.\n\nThe Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, gave his backing to the campaign yesterday with the launch of a new furniture restoration course at Council’s New 2 You Re-use facility at Pennyburn Recycling Centre.\n\nLaunching the course, the Mayor said it would provide the opportunity for people to find out new ways of reusing old materials.\n\n“I am delighted to be here today to find out more about the services offered at the New 2 You centre,” he declared.\n\n“The skill and creativity of the staff in breathing new le into old and unwanted household items is extremely impressive and a great way of utilising old materials.

This is intolerable.\n\n“There are long standing issues around commuter parking and the high volume of traffic travelling through the area and the subsequent inconvenience this is creating for residents, pedestrians and motorists. So it’s vital that there is a renewed focus on deterring illegal parking in the area as the new term begins.\n\nHe added: \"With this in mind I have asked the PSNI and traffic wardens to give a particular focus to the areas in question over the coming weeks to ensure there is minimum disruption for local residents.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"llanfair caereinion teddy surprise for rail visitors","story":"\nTeddy meets Station Master, John Brinkley.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8719001/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nThe Vintage Weekend trains require extensive shunting activity at each terminus.\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gt \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8718998/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nTwo-year-old, Rowan Vivers meets Big Ted at Llanfair Train Station.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

Till Next Week’ includes detailed biographies on wrestlers including Hamill – the son of a Harland and Wolff shipyard worker.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHave A Good Week cover\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHis memorable career included training in Sandy Row’s notorious gymnasium ‘The Pit’, dealing with other wrestlers copying his ‘Kung Fu’ character, losing his mask in a televised match with Mick McManus, fleeing a rioting crowd in Turkey, and appearing in a music video for Manhattan Transfer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe book’s author John Lister, who has been writing for wrestling publications since 1990, said: “Many wrestlers I spoke to described Eddie as underrated and ahead of his time with his aggressive, fast-paced ring style. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“He was a pleasure to speak to and helped break down the barriers with other wrestlers who were wary about talking about the behind-the-scenes element of their careers.”\n\nMr Lister put together the book over the course of six years, interviewing the stars of ITV’s ‘World Of Sport’ wrestling.\n\nHamill – who made a name for himself as a masked performer – warned others against the same ‘gimmick’.\n\nHe said: “I’d tell any young wrestler starting out today not to wear a mask.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Eventually,  you’re good enough, people will start to copy you. At one stage there were at least four imposters. \n\n“Some of them were good wrestlers like Alan Miquet who was better than I was and I couldn’t understand why he felt he had to do it. But other guys weren’t so good and it really hurt me when people would go to see ‘Kung Fu’ and leave thinking ‘That fellow’s ******* rubbish!’”\n\nAs Mr Lister writes, Hamill wasn’t the only graduate of The Pit in Sandy Row to turn pro: “Eric ‘Tug’ Wilson was a contemporary, as was Dave Finlay Sr  who became one of Hamill’s closest friends. \n\nHaving learned legitimate grappling moves in his training, Hamill says he would have tried mixed martial arts  it existed at the time. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said: “I’d have loved to have done UFC: it’s a marvellous sport. \n\n“I only ever really used it in pubs when I’d take on guys who claimed what we did was all showmanship. \n\n“I only ever had to go after another wrestler in the ring for real once. The promoter didn’t know we had such a dislike for each other when he booked the match.”\n\nAs a star of ITV’s World Of Sport, Hamill went on to increase his popularity in the tag team scene, first partnering Pete Roberts as the Kung Fu Fighters, then pairing with Clive Myers as the Martial Artists. This led to the strangest booking of his career when music group Manhattan Transfer contacted promoters and asked for two grapplers to appear in a promotional video. \n\nHe said: “Me and Clive turned up and wrestled on a bare mat for three minutes while the band played live behind us. There was also some weird storyline with a coffin that I didn’t understand. I’ve never seen the video, but as we did the whole thing in two takes. It was a damn good payoff for six minutes’ work.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDuring his career Hamill wrestled with Stampede  where he teamed with future WWF/WWE stars Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith . \n\nHamill finally hung up his boots in 1990 as injuries took their toll. \n\nHe ed to his full-time leguard role at Rhyl where he made national news with an impassioned plea for holidaymakers to avoid using inflatable dinghies at sea. \n\nWhile Hamill does not miss the injuries, he does miss the backstage atmosphere: “I went to a show in Rhyl recently and couldn’t believe it when I went in the dressing room: all the wrestlers were sat there staring at the floor and there was no personality. When we were wrestling we were like a bunch of kids and there was always somebody up to something, whether it be playing pranks or telling jokes.”\n\nThe book also includes a dedicated section on wrestling in Northern Ireland including 1930s shows with a mixture of legitimate contest and professional ‘exhibitions’, the unusual way in which the area’s amateur scene stemmed from the professional business rather than vice versa, and the pros and cons of promoting at the height of the Troubles.\n\n‘Have A Good Week ... Till Next Week’ is named after commentator Kent Walton’s signature sign-off phrase. \n\nThe 400-page book is available in print and Kindle edition at Amazon.\n            \n    \n    try   catch
