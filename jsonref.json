Photograph: Cyril Byrne Almost quarter of a million people will come and go through Dublin Airport over the bank holiday, making it the busiest weekend for international travel since before the start of the Covid-19 crisis in March last year.The airport authority, DAA, has expressed confidence that, despite a significant increase in traffic, it will have the resources in place to manage.It has also warned passengers that they will have a role to play in reducing any potential delays. With the weekend marking the start of the school midterm break, this may be the first time abroad for many families in a couple of years. The airport is encouraging travellers to make sure to allow sufficient time to make their flights and to be familiar with all the pandemic-related health and security requirements.About 225,000 passengers are expected to use the airport this weekend, compared with just over 30,000 over the October bank holiday last year, when restrictions were in place. However, Kevin Cullinane, head of communications at the DAA Group, which manages both Dublin and Cork Airport, noted that it was also a 42 per cent decrease compared with the same weekend in 2019, when passenger numbers were almost 400,000.“We have definitely seen a pick-up, and that is obviously welcome, but we are still a long way off where we were two year ago,” he said.About 1,600 flights will arrive and depart, carrying an average of more than 56,000 passengers each day up to Monday.Managing crowdsMr Cullinane said that passenger numbers had been increasing over recent weeks, which had allowed the airport officials to become familiar with managing crowds and ensuring social distancing rules and other guidelines were enforced.He expressed optimism that the airport would have sufficient resources in place to manage the largest throughput in more than 18 months.He said the airport would have customer care teams on duty across both terminals over the weekend to help passengers with their journey through the airport.He urged passengers to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their flight’s departure time and to ensure they have done their preparation in advance when it comes to paperwork.He also advised passengers to go directly to the security screening areas once they have checked in to reduce the chances of delays.Passengers travelling to EU countries will need to have their Digital Covid Certificate or a negative Covid test. They will also need to complete an electronic passenger locator form on their return to Dublin. There are also requirements particular to certain EU countries such as the need to complete a health control form in advance of travel to Spain. Specific requirements for each EU country can be found on reopen.europa.eu."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Studies suggest positive messages about post-carbon society more effectiveStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"all roads lead to cork for return of jazz festival","story":" Crowds take to the streets to celebrate jazz weekend in Cork. Photograph: Damian ColemanSocial distancing and Covid certs gave the Guinness Cork Jazz Festival a very different feel this year but the constant rain provided a touch of familiarity.On Saturday, young and old were queuing outside to get into the pole Hotel on MacCurtain Street in Cork city, where the festival originated 43 years ago as a replacement for a cancelled bridge tournament.Katie Swayne from Midleton and her friend Aoife Healy from Blarney, who are both in their 20s, said they were delighted to see the festival return after it was cancelled last year due to the pandemic.Swayne expressed admiration for the hospitality sector which she felt was making a huge effort to keep bars safe in a time of Covid.Healy referred to a street market which was running down a side street next to the pole. She said that a lot of innovation has come from the Covid-19 pandemic with businesses putting in the hard work to stay open but safe for staff and patrons alike.“A lot of good has come to Cork in the last year. And everyone is still being cautious. We are being asked for Covid certs everywhere.”Roger Russell, general manager of the pole Hotel, said while it was wonderful to have the festival up and running again “capacity will have to be monitored very carefully to ensure all our guests and all our team members are safe. That is really important.“But one of the things about the festival is that that it always brings a smile to faces and the atmosphere is always so warm and friendly.”James Lancaster of the New York Brass Band is celebrating his 10th year at the festival.“It is really exciting. We missed it last year. We kind of feel like part of the furniture when we come to places like the pole. We feel like we have come home.”Meanwhile, publican and restaurateur Ernest Cantillon, who owns Electric barrestaurant and Sober Lane bar in the city centre, said they were busier this bank holiday than in 2019, when the festival last took place.He is finding that both the public and management in pubs and restaurants are still very aware that the country is opening up at a sensitive time in the pandemic with rising numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals.“In Sober Lane last night, we had a really good brass band that would nearly be impossible not to dance to so we asked them to take a bit longer time between songs. People would go down to their seat and it calmed it down a bit. We are kind of getting cute like that.The festival is normally worth an estimated €35 million to Cork city but with fewer events, a closed airport and Covid-19 regulations it is expected it will add considerably less to the coffers of hotels and bars this year.Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Colm Kelleher, says that local business owners, bars, hoteliers and musicians are “thrilled” at the return of the festival.“The hugely significant economic impact as well as the vibrancy and energy it brings to Cork city and surrounding area is unparalleled – there is nothing else like it.“Covid hasn’t gone away. We have to be aware of that but that doesn’t mean we can’t get back to some sort of normality. This weekend all roads lead to Cork.”The festival was the brainchild of Jim Mountjoy, the then pole Hotel marketing manager, way back in 1978.Over the years it has featured many greats including Ella Fitzgerald, BB King, George Shearing, Art Blakey and Mel Tormé. The line-up has become more eclectic over the last decade and incorporates different types of music, a move that has had its supporters and detractors.Headline acts this year include trumpeter Matthew Halsall and the hugely popular Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, made up of seven brothers from the south side of Chicago.

But, that aside, the whole family are in high spirits.“The kids have not been away in just over two years so it’s really exciting. Even just being in an airport is nice.”At the other end of the terminal, Éadaoin Purcell, her husband John, and children Odhrán (9) and Saorlaith (7) have travelled from Co Kilkenny and are waiting to board a flight to Malaga in Spain. They are among a party of 19.“My dad was 75 in April and we didn’t get to celebrate it because of Covid, so we’re all going over for a belated celebration,” says Éadaoin, who adds that the family has not been abroad since the onset of the pandemic.“It’s been all staycations, but we’ve made the most of it,” says John. “We were lucky enough to buy a camper van so we went around Ireland for a couple of weeks. We’ve done as much as we could do, and getting away now is brilliant. We’re rearing to go.“Once we get through security and are about to board the plane, we’ll start believing. It’s just been put off and put off with the Covid restrictions changing so we haven’t allowed ourselves to get too excited, but it’s more real now that we’re here with the bags.”There are no nerves regarding Covid-19, and the extra red tape involved in travelling during a pandemic has not been an issue. “I’m actually surprised Spain are letting the Irish in,” says John. “There’s more chance of catching it here – or in Coppers – than there is there.”Manuel Pombo from Madrid and Esther Olea from Valladolid are recently married and are about to make their way into the terminal to travel to Spain to see their families for the first time in almost two years. Manuel has been living here 14 years and Esther for 11 years.Esther says being away from her family has been “difficult”, while Manuel says: “I miss them less.”Esther continues: “For me, it has been terrible. We thought about going last year but you could not move in Spain between regions so we decided to leave it, but it has been very hard.“We got married here during the pandemic and we were supposed to go to our families and celebrate the wedding but that never happened.“We could only have six people at the wedding, so it was a very small affair. We were supposed to get married in June and we had to change the date a couple of times and ended up getting married in September on a Tuesday at 10 in the morning. Nothing fancy.“It was my father’s birthday recently as well, and my aunt is celebrating 55 years of marriage, so we are going to spend a lot of time eating and drinking. No big parties, just family gatherings.”Are they worried about Covid? “I am very worried,” says Manuel. “She is not so much. But I have literally almost not left the house in a year and a half. So this whole concept of being around this many people is challenging.“In Spain, everybody is very huggy and says hello with two kisses. I’m sure it’s safe and everyone is fully vaccinated, but there is a little bit of anxiety here.”Are you worried about the plane? “I have been trying not to think about it,” he says. “It’s a risk but it is a managed risk and you can’t stop living your life.”Over at Terminal Two, Paul Neeson, who is coincidentally Dublin Airport’s retail director, is on his way with his wife Marie to board a plane to Nice. “It’s a business trip but there are worse places in the world to be than Nice and Cannes,” he says.“It is my first time abroad in 18 months and my job would have involved travelling every month before Covid, so part of this weekend is just the pleasure of getting up in the sky again.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"farming and greenhouse gases is it time to take the bull by the horns","story":"Dairy farming has twice as big a carbon footprint than those with suckler herds, especially because dairy cows are producing more milk annually, and thus more methane. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Italian government is seeking an exemption for luxury supercars from the total ban on combustion engines from 2035, pleading that these powerful fuel-guzzling sportscars are a special case.So what is Ireland’s Lamborghini or Ferrari? Undoubtedly it is agriculture, which has been given a free pass when it comes to climate change and, arguably, pollution.On Friday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its greenhouse gas emissions numbers for Ireland during 2020, which showed that agricultural emissions are going in the opposite direction to other sectors.Last year agriculture’s emissions increased by 1.4 per cent – up 12 per cent over the last 10 years – driven by increased fertiliser nitrogen use (3.3 per cent) and increased numbers of livestock, including dairy cows (3.2 per cent).Over the past decade the number of dairy cow in Irish milking herds has increased by 45.5 per cent, with a corresponding milk production increase of 60.3 per cent.Agriculture is the State’s biggest single contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, the largest cause of nitrogen pollution in Irish rivers and waters, and the source of of virtually all ammonia pollution, blamed on fertilisers.Ireland has been exceeding the legal limit each year since 2016 and by increasing margins, contradicting the bucolic and green image of Irish agriculture long beloved by promoters.The image is becoming harder to maintain against growing evidence of its industrialisation, particularly dairy farming, despite the natural advantage bestowed by a mild climate and a plenitude of grasses.But that advantage only brings it so far. The predominant grassland for many years now has been monoculture or rye grass, highly dependent on nitrogen fertiliser, and with adverse consequences for bioersity.The Food Harvest 2025 agriculture strategy placed competitiveness and environmental sustainability as equally important pillars, but those now, say critics, are nothing more than words on a page.The evidence is that the significant economic expansion of agriculture, particularly driven by the end of milk quotas in 2014, has come at a significant environmental cost.Nitrogen pollution is closely linked to intensive farming, and the more nitrogen used the more of it that will be found in rivers and streams. Since 2013, nitrogen emissions have risen.Half of all of the State’s 4,900 rivers, streams, lakes and estuaries are sub-standard ecologically, the EPA told the Oireachtas Agriculture Commission this week, with 1,000 polluted by nitrates.Most of the latter occurs in the south and southeast, the heart of Ireland’s dairy sector. Many iconic rivers – the Bandon, Lee, Blackwater, Suir, Nore, Barrow and Slaney – are polluted, the agency said.Ireland enjoys a derogation under the EU Nitrates Directive that allows intensive farmers (dairy farmers, mostly) to apply 250kg of livestock manure per hectare, rather than 170kg. That derogation comes up for review at year’s end.The continuation of the Irish derogation is “a conundrum”, says Dr Oliver Moore from the Centre for Co-operative Studies in UCC. “Only Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark still have this out of 27 EU member states.”A recent EU Court of Auditors study showed that since 2014 the area covered by the derogation increased by a third, coupled with a 38 per cent increase in the number of animals.“We face tough decisions between levels of dairy viability and profitability on the one hand, and environmental damage on the other,” Dr Moore told The .Just 2,000 nitrates inspections take place on farms each year, the EPA told the Oireachtas Committee, which complained that compliance with good farming practices “varies from county to county, but it is generally considered to be low”.Still, Ireland wants to continue the derogation.“We will be working to ensure we maintain it,” says Charlie McConalogue, the Minister for Agriculture. “We need the capacity at farm level to be able to use higher levels of nitrate.”In other moments McConalogue has talked about the fragility of nature and the need to cut down on agriculture’s carbon footprint.“Nature is fragile and needs to be nurtured and given space... Every sector will have to play its part in climate change.We all have to play a role.”But what role for agriculture? McConalogue wants a variety of measures, including a move to grass less dependent on fertiliser or the use of protected urea which releases nitrogen more slowly.Meanwhile, the Minister favours the use of low-emission slurry-spreading, better farm and storage management, and the creation of a chemical fertiliser register.Pointing to a pilot scheme to encourage farmers to use different types of grass and clover on the one field, McConalogue argues that 10,500 farmers applied, 10 times more than had been expected.Like politicians from the three major parties, McConalogue believes farmers respond better to carrots rather than sticks, but critics argue that the evidence to back that up is mixed at best.Take, for example, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Until now dairy farms – the biggest polluters in farming – have been minimally involved with environmental schemes.Politicians such as Roscommon-Galway East TD Michael Fitzmaurice argue that it is the big dairy farm operations in the south and southeast that are most to blame, not the smaller farmers on poorer land in the north and west.Under the current CAP, just 13 per cent of dairy farms have signed up to the GLAS environmental scheme – 10,000 farms are not signed up to any CAP scheme, including some of the State’s biggest intensive dairy operations.However, McConalogue says things will change under the next CAP where farmers must sign up for environmental measures in order to get a quarter of their basic CAP payment.For a dairy farm, however, that might require nothing more than to plant three native trees per hectare each year. For a 50-hectare farm that would require planting 750 trees between 2023 and 2030.In the meantime agriculture will be asked to reduce emissions by a minimum of 21 per cent under the new Carbon Action Plan under the Common Agriculture Policy.The Department of Agriculture believes it can do it without reducing the herd, but others are sceptical. McConalogue says there are signs the national herd is stabilising, but the latest EPA report shows a marked increase again in 2020.Dr Hannah Daly, lecturer in energy systems in the department of engineering, UCC, says: “ What we are doing is increasing methane emissions.”The Government constantly argues that Ireland has the most sustainable dairy industry in the EU, but the data for that dates back to 2005, and many changes for the worse have happened since, argues Daly.Dairy farming has twice as big a carbon footprint than those with suckler herds, especially because dairy cows are producing more milk annually, and thus more methane.Meanwhile farmers are slow to think of new ways, reluctant to ersify into pigs or apple trees or any other type of farming, says the Cork-based academic.In time, however, farmers will be the first group affected by climate change. “They will be the first ones to be hit when there is drought or adverse weather. Diversification is a strategy to mitigate against that,” she says.But for now the cows are milking well, and there is plenty still in the field. While it lasts there is still a strong residual reluctance to stop driving the Lamborghini."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics inside ten years as a government advisor with ed brophy","story":"Ed Brophy is a former chief of staff to finance minister Paschal Donohoe and to Labour’s Joan Burton when she was Tánaiste.

Initially, examining the legacy of the Troubles meant delivering closure for the families of those killed, something I think everybody, bar the terrorists and their associates, would support. Later, it came to mean trying to prosecute people for killings during the Troubles, a far more contentious process. Ultimately, both approaches have failed.Today, addressing Northern Ireland’s legacy means elderly veterans being dragged through inquests, criminal investigations and court hearings. Some, such as my client Dennis Hutchings, die in the process. The families don’t get the justice they seek. Most are not even able to enter into this process, as the terrorists who killed 90 per cent of the victims are not involved. The system doesn’t benefit anyone apart from the lawyers.I am a lawyer asking that it stops. It is time to accept that the criminal legal system will not deliver the convictions some want and impose a statute of limitations.In order to prove that the system is broken we only need to look at some of the cases that have failed.The Saville Report into Bloody Sunday followed the longest and most detailed public inquiry ever held. It hasn’t led to a single successful prosecution. Everyone has a right against self-incrimination and so to enable soldiers and the terrorists who fired that day to give evidence to the inquiry, it was agreed that nothing they said could be used against them.The trial of two soldiers accused of killing Joe McCann collapsed in May precisely because it was built on this inadmissible evidence, a fact that was obvious to everybody as long ago as the 1970s. Such technical issues in effect prevent prosecutions from before 1973.Even if such cases were not subject to these blocks, the delay in bringing the prosecution and the difficulty of proving the crime mean they almost certainly would have failed.In most historic examples of war crimes, it is a question of identity. Whether or not the accused was a concentration camp guard, for example. By contrast, military cases in Northern Ireland are hugely complex. Usually they hinge on a split second decision to fire made 40 years ago. Soldiers at the time signed statements that they were entitled to fire and had committed no crime. All these years laters, memories have faded and witnesses died. It is hugely difficult to unpick the details of events and next to impossible to prove that the soldier on trial had criminal intent. It is an abuse of process to allow the prosecution.Mr Hutchings was accused of murdering John Patrick Cunningham, a 27-year-old man shot dead in 1974. Had he got to his evidence, Mr Hutchings would have explained that he fired shots into the air and had not fired at Mr Cunningham at all. The Prosecution received witness evidence from soldiers stating that Mr Hutchings did not shoot Mr Cunningham, while another soldier admitted that he had shot Mr Cunningham.It emerged last week, when the prosecution fire arms expert was giving evidence, that this soldier had fired tracer bullets. These would have left a chemical signature. We could have tested the field dressings that Mr Hutchings applied to try and save Mr Cunningham’s life, but they had not been kept by the police. We could have tested Mr Cunningham’s clothes but they had not been kept. Essential evidence that would have helped prove Mr Hutchings’ innocence was no longer available. It is clear that we cannot go on like this.One option that has been suggested is a truth and reconciliation process. But that will only work if comes with a genuine desire to seek the whole truth. My sense is that the last thing the paramilitaries will do is open up as the army has. Sadly, those connected with terror organisations who since became politicians also fail to see the hypocrisy in calling for such a process while keeping quiet about what they know.The only fair way to proceed is with a statute of limitations, something I would like to see known as “Dennis’s Law”. This would simply reflect the reality for the vast majority of people given that ninety per cent of the crimes during the Troubles were committed by unknown terrorists and that the chances of prosecuting British soldiers are extremely slim.It would also save any other elderly soldiers from having to suffer the same ordeal as Mr Hutchings. Soldiers who served overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan have protection from prosecution, those who served in Northern Ireland deserve the same.Philip Barden is a partner at Devonshires SolicitorsMore from NewsHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadJapan\u0026#39s Princess Mako set to marry commoner without royal ritualsHate crimes risk distracting police from focusing on serious offences, warns policing chiefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"get booster jab save christmas britons urged country faces covid","story":"The NHS’s most senior doctor has urged those eligible for Covid-19 booster jabs to “take up the offer” in order to “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”.Writing in The , Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, says that “the freedom we now all enjoy” was a direct result of the willingness of patients to come forward for jabs.His warning that the country is at a “crunch point” comes amid concern in the Government over the speed of the booster rollout, as well as rising hospitalisations.Scientists have said that uptake of the booster, or third jab, was crucial in determining whether the UK would need to switch to a “Plan B” involving compulsory mask-wearing and a return to at-home working. Under a potential “Plan C”, mixing with people from other households could also once again be banned, under measures that have been discussed by officials.On Saturday, Boris Johnson said: “Vaccines are our way through this winter. We’ve made phenomenal progress, but our job isn’t finished yet, and we know that vaccine protection can drop after six months.”In an article written after the Prime Minister redeployed Emily Lawson, the head of his new delivery unit, back to the health service to resume responsibility for the rollout, Prof Powis stated: “This time last year, the whole country was bracing itself for another lockdown.“There were more than 6,800 people in hospital with Covid, and cases and admissions were rising at an alarming rate. Fast forward to today and cases are rising again, with 6,405 people in hospital with Covid going into this weekend.”Last week, it emerged that fewer than four million of the 8.5 million at-risk people who had a second jab at least six months ago had received their third dose.Meanwhile, British people who want a Christmas holiday abroad were being advised to get a third jab because countries may impose stricter definitions of what constitutes being fully vaccinated.From November 1, Israel will only admit to their country those people who are either still within six months of their second jab or those who have a third booster jab if those six months have elapsed.About 2.2 million people each week will become eligible for a booster jab because six months will have elapsed since their second jab, the time period when efficacy of the vaccine begins to wane.Paul Charles, a travel expert, believes many countries will soon insist all Britons have had three vaccines before being let in.“We are now at the stage where we are well over six months since the first British people had their jabs. You’ve got to get a booster because what countries are doing is looking to ‘de-risk’ entry,” he said.“It might well end up being that if you want to travel at Christmas, you’ve got to have had the booster. They want to make sure that anybody entering is vaccinated with all the latest possible jabs.”More from NewsHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadJapan\u0026#39s Princess Mako set to marry commoner without royal ritualsHate crimes risk distracting police from focusing on serious offences, warns policing chiefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"man wants wake us woke racism","story":"John McWhorter, 56, is an African-American professor of linguistics at Columbia University, son of an avid civil rights campaigner. An unlikely figure, you might think, to have shot to fame as a scourge of woke pieties and a committed critic of America’s anti-racist movement. But McWhorter has never allowed himself to be bullied out of saying what he thinks, a courageous tenacity on full show in his new book, Woke Racism, published last week in the US.Thus the arguments of Woke Racism will speak loud and clear to audiences here too, even if it is centred on the American landscape. The book argues that in its haste to define black people as victims, the new “religion” of woke has reimposed racist strictures on the horizons of African-Americans. This is not the first time McWhorter has made such arguments. In 2000, he published the best-selling Losing the Race: Self Sabotage in Black America, a passionate elucidation of the way “victimology”, “separatism” and “anti-intellectualism” were holding African-Americans back. This was followed by Winning the Race in 2006, a less polemical treatment. But McWhorter’s talents and interests extend far beyond race. He is a specialist in Creole: of the 22 books he’s written, 17 are about language (four about Creole), and one, All About the Beat, is about hip hop. He’s also a passionate and knowledgeable musicologist, and committed to “reclaiming black music”, including opera.Like their millions of listeners, I had long been dazzled by the wry, intellectual charm on show in McWhorter’s wide-ranging conversations with fellow black anti-wokester, the Brown economics professor Glenn Loury, on Loury’s cult The Glenn Show. I wanted to know: how did McWhorter come to swim so hard, yet gracefully, against the tide?In search of an answer, I meet him in his roomy, homely New York apartment, full of books and records. His tenaciously friendly cat firmly outside the study, McWhorter sits in his swivel chair, fingers in a pyramid under his chin, and explains to me how he got to be who he is.“It happened in the 1990s,” McWhorter begins. “I had grown up thinking that the old days for black people had been horrible, that there had been great victories in the 1950s and 1960s, and that I was lucky enough to have grown up in the 1970s and 1980s when things had gotten so much better. I thought, there is a victory that black people forged and I am taking advantage of it. And yes, racism exists… and yes, the past is not completely over, but… this is a new world.”Then came “the response in the black community” to the Rodney King verdict of 1992: three of the four police officers filmed beating King in LA during an arrest for drunk driving were acquitted, sparking a week of rioting that killed 63 and injured 2,383 and had to be stopped by the National Guard and the Army. “I didn’t understand why people took the Rodney King verdict as evidence that all black people live in a country where it’s difficult for us to get justice. That struck me as something somebody could plausibly have said in 1960, but not 1991... Why is it that these perfectly sensible people have this melodramatic view of racism in this country? And that’s where it began,” he says.So has anything changed since he wrote Losing the Race? “The sad thing is that here in 2021, the word on the street about race is similar to what it was,” says McWhorter. Things had been “getting better” thanks to a consensus that emerged around 2010 “that racism exists but… black people’s problems are due partly to bias and partly to cultural problems that people have to work on themselves”.“That’s partly why I’ve started kicking harder than I have in about 15 years. Because it won’t do. We’ve got to get rid of this idea that ‘yes we can’t’ is a constructive mantra.”As for the murder of George Floyd, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement’s meteoric rise, it was “egregious and it’s important we know about it. It’s also important we know that white Tony Timpa was killed the same way in Texas four years before”.McWhorter, an ardent fan of Keeping Up Appearances (he’s watched it all four times over), thinks class is a useful tool for understanding who is a victim and who is not, and regrets that it’s not part of the American conversation. “In the US roughly we think that black people are lower class and white people are middle class and we don’t like to talk about the lower class whites. We say, it doesn’t matter that they don’t have much money, they still have white privilege, because supposedly the cops are nicer to them, but in fact the cops aren’t nicer to miscreant white men, but we don’t talk about that.”The reason, of course, for this tunnel vision is critical race theory (CRT), a strain of academic thought that foists everything into the halter of power struggle. White people are always oppressors, black people always their victims. It is a mandatory ideology in many workplaces – corporate, state and educational – in the form of unconscious bias training, a practice McWhorter abhors. “If Columbia requires me to do that I am going to formally refuse and see what happens.” I ask McWhorter if his career as a linguist has helped sharpen his critique of the pretentious jargon of wokedom he skewers so well in Woke Racism. He says no: he’s a language “nerd” and that’s separate, except it isn’t, because “I like teaching myself Russian etcetera and then I’m trying to be the nerd that I am, and there’s this whole dialogue that is telling me that to be a nerd about anything but Martin Luther King means I’m not black… how dare you study Russian, especially some white language, when you should be on the barricades with us studying black things, and my thought was always, well, I do study some black things, but is it that urgent? Are we that oppressed?” McWhorter admits his own first academic positions at Cornell and Berkeley were tokenistic, rather than based on merit, though that is certainly no longer the case. What, then, of America’s vexed commitment to affirmative action – whereby standards for racial minorities are relaxed to get them into elite institutions?  “In 1966, to apply that policy to black people overall made sense because most black people were poor, it was a different world. I agree with not having one standard of grades and test scores. But you do it based on socioeconomics, you don’t do it based on race, and you don’t hire black people with visibly lesser qualifications with the idea that that’s somehow doing the right thing.”Woke Racism is stuffed with frank talk like this, and McWhorter expects it to appeal to a liberal “middle ground” – black and white – tired of being accused of being racists or race-traitors. Can a book, however clever and appealing, make a difference? “There’s a crack in everything and the light gets in,” says McWhorter, quoting Leonard Cohen. Our time is up, the cat demands to be fed and his daughters will soon be home from the babysitter. I leave uplifted: this intellectual, fair-minded man has identified a hungry demand for “another voice” and is feeding it with nourishing common sense, wit and a strong dose of reality. “Things,” as he says, “are changing”. He must be right.More from NewsHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadJapan\u0026#39s Princess Mako set to marry commoner without royal ritualsHate crimes risk distracting police from focusing on serious offences, warns policing chiefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Sunday.

However, the more that the virus is able to spread, the more chance there is of it finding a way to break through vaccine defences. Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"autumn budget 2021 predictions what","story":"Autumn Budget  predictions - and what spending review could mean for youThe future of the UK economy hangs in the balance when the Budget  is announced.

The energy bills price cap has already jumped by £ on October  and it’s set to rise again in April.Meanwhile furlough and the evictions ban have ended, Universal Credit ’s been cut by £ a week, and there are supply shortages in the shops.On top of the all that, the Tory Chancellor is set to unveil a three-year Spending Review that could put the squeeze on public services even further.So how will it all affect the country, and you and your wallet  Here are all the Budget confirmed policies, predictions and rumours so far. The Budget could lay out the full grim extent of the cost of living crisis to come this winter. Mr Sunak will read out GDP growth and borrowing figures which could y from earlier in the Covid pandemic. But the most important figure will be inflation - which is predicted by Budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility . Only in March it predicted inflation would be .% this year - it’s double that, and could rise even further. That will have a massive impact on families.  Inflation hikes the cost of your weekly shop and could turn into a spike in mortgage costs,the Bank of England raises the base rate later this year. They could also wipe out any increases in government spending or public sector wages. There is also a row over claims the Chancellor will use out-of-date data to polish up his claims about the economy in time for a   election.  Spending review squeeze Alongside the normal Budget will be a three-year ‘spending review’, setting out departments’ budgets right up to Spring . And while it won’t be a vehicle for the brutal austerity of George Osborne, there will likely be cuts hiding in plain sight. It’s no longer as fashionable for Tories to shout about making cuts, but after Covid spending they need to come from somewhere. That means we could see vague or unspecic lines about efficiency savings that have a huge impact on public services down the line. In the March Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studiesthink tank identied a £bn black hole that would make the Spending Review “particularly tough” for unprotected areas of government. While these don’t include the NHS they do include the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, and local government which funds social care. “There’s going to be something that feels a bit like austerity for at least some public serviceswe are going to keep to these spending plans,” said the IFS.  We already know Brits who earn over £, a year will see their National Insurance Contributions rise from % to .% from April . The £bn-a-year measure will cost £ a year for a worker on £, £ for a worker on £, and £ for a worker on £,. Firms will have to contribute too. From April , this .-point rise will be named the ’Health and Social Care Levyapos and appear separately on Britsapos payslips. From this point it will also apply to workers who are above pension age - which NICs do not. From October , the money will be partly used to fund a new £, cap on the amount people must pay for care over their letimes - and a new-style £, floor, which saves people from paying for their care once assets fall below a certain level. But just £.bn of £bn raised in the first three yearswill go on social care. Of the £.bn, half of it will go towards new costs caused by the cap and floor - leaving a measly £.bn or so for workforce, training, councils and better integration with the NHS. Minimum wage rise There was much hype at the Tory conference that Boris Johnson would push up the minimum wage - only for him not to announce anything solid. But the Mirror understands a standard annual rise for April  is expected to be announced in the Budget. Currently £. an hour for over-s , the Tories have claimed they’ll make it £. an hour for over-s by . That is because they claimed future rises would be pegged to two-thirds of median earnings, higher than the previous % target. Rishi Sunak shouldn’t take too much credit for the April  rise - after all, minimum wages rise every year, especially when inflation is up.But given Boris Johnson has pinned his hopes on businesses creating a “high-wage” economy, no doubt he will try to take the glory. Cigarette, alcohol and fuel duty changes  Tobacco duties tend to rise in the Budget - and could do so at pm on the same day to avoid bulk buying. The last rise in November  put p on a pack of  cigarettes and p on a g pack of hand-rolling tobacco. Tobacco duties rise using an escalator, which last time was % above RPI inflation . With inflation soaring, a similar escalator could impose a massive rise this year. But rises on beer, cider, wine and spirits were all frozen in the year from April . Now the whole structure of them could be overhauled . And fuel duty has been frozen for  years in a row and there’s no reason to suggest Rishi Sunak won’t make it a th. These days, each year’s freeze alone is projected to cost the Treasury around £bn a year by . That’s money that could be spent on green initiatives, public transport and cycling. But the political hit of raising fuel duty when petrol prices have just spiked to a nine-year high would be enormous. £m for children and families - after years of cuts The Chancellor has announced £m for children and families, including £m to set up family hubs in  new council areas. These will be a aposone-stop-shopapos to deliver parenting programmes , breastfeeding adviceand mental health support . It confirms reports that Rishi Sunak wanted to focus on childcare in his Budget. The money also includes a £m Start for Le offer, £m on workforce pilots and £m for expanding the Supporting Families programme. But it comes after the Tories cut £ a week from Universal Credit and imposed the two-child benefits limit. Nurseries also say they’re at breaking point, as the government doesn’t give them enough cash to run  hours’ a week free childcare properly. The Lib Dems warned the cash is a drop in the ocean after years of Tory cuts to services like Sure Start. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green added: “This is a smokescreen for the Conservatives’ failure to deliver for families.” Neil Leitch, CEO of the Early Years Alliance, said: “To invest in these new initiatives while leaving the existing early years infrastructure to crumble is, frankly, negligent. Transport upgrades in eight regions of England  A £.billion list of transport upgrade projects for eight regions of England is set to be confirmed. The Chancellor said projects will include improving the A between Wakefield and Leeds for buses, cyclists and pedestrians. New link tram vehicles will be ordered in Manchester while rail stations are revamped in Darlington, Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Runcorn. Overall Greater Manchester will get £.bn, West Midlands £.bn, West Yorkshire £m, Liverpool City Region £m, South Yorkshire £m, West of England £m and Tees Valley £m. The North East is set to get just over £m but projects will not be spelt out until a regional governance shake-up is complete. On top of the £.bn, Mr Sunak will pledge £.bn on buses by  to speed up journey times, simply fares and increase the number of services outside London, with details in the coming months. But of the £.bn to be announced only £.bn is new money. The cash for city regions was already announced as £.bn and is being increased. The £.bn on buses comes from a £bn pot Boris Johnson already announced in March. £m to revamp sports pitches The Treasury says there will be £million to build or improve up to , sports pitches across the UK. Up to  youth facilities like scout huts, youth centres and activity centres, will also be built or refurbished in deprived areas. VA, Tate and Natural History Museum get cash The Chancellor has confirmed a £m pot over three years for local culture, museums and galleries. Big bucks go to the VA in London, Tate Liverpool and the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, which share £m between them. Likewise the Natural History Museum will get £m to help build a new scientic research centre in Oxfordshire, and the British Library site at Boston Spa will get £m. Itaposs tougher competition for  other regional museums and libraries, who share £m between them. A fund for veteransapos health The government has confirmed a Veterans’ Health Innovation Fund worth £m over an unspecied timeframe. It will provide research grants into finding new surgeries for amputees and blast victims, and new mental health treatment. There will also be new technology to help injured veterans rebuild their lives and participate in work, education and sport. Things that are tipped to be in the Budget Public sector pay  In   public sector pay rises were paused, except in the NHS and for workers on less than £, who got a small rise. Political pressure is huge not to do the same thing again, especially with inflation and fuel bills savaging families’ existing budgets. But the problem for Rishi Sunak is, even a % or % rise in public sector wages would likely become a real-terms cut due to inflation. And that means having to spend a huge amount on any proper pay rise. Will he take the hit  And when - will he announce his intentions in the spending review like he did in , or wait for review bodies to report back next year  A massive shake-up in alcohol duties Treasury officials are said to see the current system of alcohol duties as outdated and complicated and want to smooth it out. The Chancelloraposs plans could see the cost of sparkling wine falling and some taxes on beer cut as well.But the spirits industry fears it could also mean % hikes for whisky, gin and other spirits which they say will hamper their recovery after Covid and Brexit.And craft and independent brewers fear changes to Small Breweries’ Relief . They say the government could more than halve the threshold for a % beer duty rate, piling £, extra in beer duty costs a yer on  small breweries. Society of Independent Brewerschief James Calder said: The uncertainty over what will happen to SBR is causing a great deal of anxiety.  A tax break for banks - at the same time as benefits are cut The Financial Times reported the Chancellor will slash a tax surcharge on bank profits from % to %. The move is supposedly designed to keep the City happy and prosperous as corporation tax rises from % back up to %. But it could provoke fury as the Chancellor as refused to provide the £bn needed to keep a £-a-week Universal Credit uplt. Universal Credit changes  DWP ministers have been lobbying Mr Sunak to raise Universal Credit for the .million claimants who work - weeks after cutting it by £. They want the “taper rate” - the amount of Universal Credit withdrawn for every pound someone earns - to be cut from p to p to let working families keep more of their money. The £bn a year move would be the first taper change in five years, and would partially cushion the blow of the £-a-week cut. But sources were downbeat about whether Mr Sunak would accept the move. And evena p change in the taper was approved, it would not come close to making up for the £-a-week cut for most families. A -year-old single mum working  hours a week on minimum wage could be £. a week better off. But because UC is being cut by £ across the board, she would still be £. worse off than she is now. Those still covered by work allowances, or too sick to work, would not benefit at all from changes to the taper.

End of the line for HS to Leeds Fears are mounting that the Tories will abandon a key rail link to the Red Wall - despite promises it would go ahead. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps refused to guarantee the eastern leg of HS - the high speed line to Leeds - would still be built. The Spending Review could be a crucial time to confirm - or strangle off - funding to this project for the future. Slashing VAT on household bills Rishi Sunak could slash VAT on household energy bills to help struggling families through the winter cost of living crisis. The Chancellor is reportedly considering cutting the % rate even though he has resisted pressure to splash taxpayersapos cash where. But Treasury officials played down the likelihood of Mr Sunak announcing a cut amid concerns he might set a precedent - and send the wrong message ahead of a green summit. No big business rates reform The Treasury promised a ‘fundamental’ review of how business rates work back in March . But it’s thought we will not see any large-scale reform until next year after hopes to include it in this Budget fell apart. That is despite the fact a major overhaul of business rates is getting more and more urgent. High Street shops say they’re being left at a disadvantage compared to online warehouse giants like Amazon. No solid plan for ‘levelling up’ No doubt Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak will take all the above announcements as evidence of their plan to ‘level up’ the Midlands and north of England. But will there be a cohesive, coherent plan that spells out exactly what levelling up means  Don’t bank on that - we’ve not seen it properly so far, and one source suggested a levelling up White Paper will only arrive the week after the Budget.

As mentioned previously, I spend a lot of my week reading stuff so you don’t have to. It’s a pleasure, you’re welcome. This week it was a lot of stuff Mr C has been putting out on his blog, or whatever the name is of the  he’s using now.I can’t quite remember – there was a lot of it and I’m tired. He has options, this man – lots of them. The highlight was his plan for Labour. He says they are going about things the wrong way, concentrating on the wrong issues, and being led by the wrong leader. The great thing about Mr Cummings is that he is full of solutions.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  In this case, Labour’s solutions are simple: get tough on crime, get off issues like trans rights and appoint a woman, preferably one from the Midlands. He suggests Lisa Nandy, which is a good shout, despite her not being from the Midlands. But, you know, it’s hard to get hold of a large print Collins Road Atlas. Mr Cummings thinks Ms Nandy could do damage to the Tories, who he says are vulnerable in the North at the moment, despite the resounding election victory last time round. He also recommends moving Labour HQ to the North, which would upset a lot of people in London – but not me, because it would be a phenomenal excuse to go home more. We will see. But the idea that great world thinkers like the man himself have spotted the weaknesses in a previously untouchable position is interesting. It is a case of the right approach. I’m not sure crime is the magic bullet, and a blind spot people have in Westminster is treating the North like it is one homogenous entity. It isn’t. New polling of , Midlands voters backs this up, revealing the stunning conclusion that % of voters say the biggest fear for most of them is climate change.What’s more, % of people don’t think we’re doing enough to tackle the problem – this was highest in Hereford, at %, which is understandable I suppose, given the recent flooding there. Many of the ,, according to figures from Midlands Connect, would prefer electric cars and give up next day deliveries, foreign holidays, anything  that has an environmental impact to help tackle climate change. It is interesting reading, particularly as there is a growing feeling in Westminster that climate change and green issues – however important – are not cutting through. They clearly are. You can’t put the news on these days without seeing someone glued to a train or a motorway and COP starts in Glasgow next week, which should add a bit more momentum. Researcher ComRes has an eye on it too and its latest stats show support for the Greens is growing – although, worryingly, at Labour’s expense. It says: “New polling suggests that it might not take much for voters, particularly younger ones and those perhaps disaffected by Labour’s own green credentials, to make the switch.” Strange,after all this bickering over the Red Wall and the former Red Wall and the crumbling Blue Wall it turned out that, this whole time, it was Green.

New leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay demanded a bumped-up, one-off Winter Fuel Payment to be extended to every household in the country this year. It would come on top of the existing Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners and certain benefit claimants, worth between £ and £. That means people would be eligible for a maximum of £, the Green Party said, to help them cope with rises in the cost of living. It would be funded by a one-off, £billion windfall tax on all landlords of privately-rented homes - charging % of the value of their land. This is not the same as the value of the property itself, and can be less, but further figures were not immediately available. The co-leaders were due to announce the policy in their first speech to the Green Party conference this afternoon.  I comes after the energy price cap was hiked by £ on October , with another larger hike expected in April and energy firms pushing for a third hike in the middle of winter. Mr Ramsay said: “It’s a costed proposal to be funded from a one-off % land-value tax on residential landlord properties. “This proposal is about keeping households from spiralling into fuel poverty, it’s about keeping people safe. “It’s about the state responding to market failure. It’s about human dignity. “Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership. It’s an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand - something they just don’t get. It’s also just a bridge to get us to the tough work of a real, Green New Deal.” Green Party officials believe the scheme - essentially a form of universal basic income - could be a “bridge” to their pledge to invest £billion a year in a Green New Deal. The party has pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by , two decades earlier than the government’s current pledge. Ms Denyer was expected to say in the joint speech: “People have grown tired of choosing the ‘least worst’ option. Of being patronised, ignored and told what to think. We are tired of a Tory government playing ide and rule. Tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people. Tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys club serving the interests of its pals. We need better - we demand better. We see none of it from an official opposition that fails the public, ignores the votes of its own members, and can’t take a stand on the biggest issues of the day.

He was later made a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords, which is today debating a Bill that will enable terminally ill adults to legally seek assistance to end their lives. Peers heard Lord Field - who campaigned against bereavement benefit cuts as chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee - was unable to attend today’s debate, having spent time recently in a hospice. Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, who is leading the Bill, said: “Our colleague Lord Field of Birkenhead, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.” The statement from Lord Field said: “I’ve just spent a period in a hospice and I’m not well enough to participate in today’s debate. If I had been, I would have spoken strongly in favour of the second reading [of the Bill]. “I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early, before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity. A major argument against the Bill is unfounded. It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives. Do you support assisted dying  Join the debate in the Commons below.  The numbers of assisted deaths in the US and Australia remains very low, under %, and a former Supreme Court judge in Victoria, Australia, about pressure from relatives, said: ’It just hasn’t been an issue’. I hope the House will today vote for the Assisted Dying Bill. Lord Field was MP for Birkenhead on Merseyside from  to , making him one of the longest-serving MPs in the Commons.Born to a Tory labourer and teaching assistant during the Second World War, he was briefly a member of the Young Conservatives before joiningLabourfor most of his le.He first stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in South Buckinghamshire in  when he was .

The Assisted Dying Bill, tabled by Baroness Meacher, proposes that only terminally ill patients with full mental capacity, and are not expected to live more than six months would be eligible to apply for an assisted death. Campaigners argue that a change in the law would give those at the end of their lives greater control over how and when they die. Heartbroken Tory peer Michael Forsyth admitted he will back the bill after his dying father changed his mind. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, told BBC Radio : “Just before he died I went to see him and said aposIaposm so sorry, dad, youaposre in this positionapos, and he completely took me aback by saying aposwell, youaposre to blame, because you and others have consistently voted against the right to die, I would like to be relieved of this, they canapost relieve the pain and I am in this position because of folk like you.”  However opponents, including many religious leaders, warned that it could leave vulnerable people exposed to unwanted pressure. The Archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the BBC that although the safeguards in the legislation were stronger than in previous attempts to change the law, they still did not go far enough. What we want is assisted living, not assisted dying. “There is no dference between us in compassion.” The topic is being debated today in Parliament for the first time in six years. Previous attempts to introduce similar laws have all been defeated. Dame Prue Leith has backed the bill and slammed critics of “scaremongering” families. Writing in the , she said: “Opponents to the Bill fear that grasping children will coerce dying parents to get their doctors to see them off so they can inherit. If someone is going to die within six months anyway, which must be the case to qualy for assistance to die, why would anyone risk prosecution to get the money a few months earlier  This is despite her son, Tory MP Danny Kruger campaigning against the change in law. Mr Kruger set up the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well. Mr Johnson is not expected to back the plans and it is unlikely to become law without government support.

Passengers must take a photo of their lateral flow test and booking reference supplied by the private provider and send it back to them to very the result.They are also able to book a test which they can take on their arrival into England at testing centres located in some airports.People using PCR tests for travel will have their test reported by the company they bought the test from.Anyone testing positive will need to isolate and take a confirmatory PCR test, at no additional cost to the traveller, which can be genomically sequenced to help identy new iants.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said: “The change in rules for post-arrival tests will give passengers more options and faster results, just in time for many half-term holidays. “It’s thanks to the success of our vaccination programme that we can make this switch – giving the industry and consumers a much-needed boost.” Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency , said: “Testing and self-isolatingyou are positive remain crucial steps to managing the pandemic and stopping the spread of Covid- in the community. “It is also critical that those who have positive Lateral Flow Tests when ing to England go on to get this checked through a NHS Test  Trace PCR.

Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByMark Steel:,  Oct | commentsThese anti-vaxxer people get more excited every day, screaming at us to stop wearing masks. It’s hard to understand why they’re so angry about what we wear. Maybe they’ll move on to other garments. They’ll stand in shopping centres screaming: “DON’T WEAR UNDERPANTS. They’re part of a SINISTER PLAN by world governments to RUB THINGS AGAINST YOUR CROTCH.” Within a year Piers Corbyn will be at a rally in Trafalgar Square setting fire to a heap of socks, while David Icke makes a speech that “there’s no such thing as feet”. The problem is our government is almost as bonkers.  For example, MP Gillian Keegan said “wearing a mask shouldn’t be seen as a sign of virtue.” Because look at these smug types who wear a mask just because scientists agree it’s a main way of stopping the spread of a disease. It’s the same with these people who think they’re full of virtue, because they don’t ever take a leopard into an old people’s home. “Ooh, look at me”, they whine, “I’m such a goody-two-shoes making sure none of the residents get mauled by a wild animal.” We’re one of the few countries that hasn’t introduced vaccine passports for entry into nightclubs or cinemas. This is because it’s considered to be discrimination, against people who have decided not to have the vaccine. This is true, in the same way thatsomeone’s searched before they go into an event at a stadium, it discriminates against people who like carrying a set of swords and a flame thrower. The initial inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic found them to be incompetent, having ignored the science, causing thousands of ­unnecessary deaths.  One of many low points was last December, when before a late U-turn, the Government announced “Boris has saved Christmas” by ignoring all the scientists that said you MUST NOT delay the lockdown until after Christmas. You might as well say “I SAVED THE BIRTHDAY” because you allowed the children’s party to go ahead, even though you discovered an unexploded bomb under the trle. They’ve been like that throughout, so now our Covid rates are rising faster than anywhere . And the Government says they’re considering a Plan B. For  months they have been announcing plans, then reversing them, insisting there will be no lockdowns a few hours before introducing lockdowns. They’re way past Plan B. If they’re on Plan B it’s because they’ve gone right round the alphabet and started again, like car registration numbers. Now they insist we have to “learn to live” with Covid. But learning to live with something doesn’t mean pretending it’s not there. Next week Johnson will tell us: “Scientists have warned that as winter’s coming, it might get cold. Their figures suggest it could get dark early, and there could be rain or even snow! “So rather than wear extra clothes or put the heating on, we recommend you learn to live with it.” Then we’ll see groups of people in every shopping centre yelling: “Don’t wear coats, there’s NO SUCH THING AS ­TEMPERATURE.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labour analysis found the number of buy to let mortgages tripled after the chancellor announced the tax cut in his  budget.Last July, Mr Sunak announced that the zero rate would be increased from £  to £ . But the discount applied to landlords and second homeowners, and analysis of figures from UK Finance shows that buy to let mortgages tripled from   when the holiday was announced in July , to   in June  when the biggest discount came to an end. Meanwhile, the proportion of mortgages to first time buyers was down every month from October  to June . In March and April , the months before the holiday was first expected to end, the proportion of mortgages to first time buyers was down % on the previous year.  Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary Lucy Powell said: “The Conservatives have wasted millions of pounds on a stamp duty holiday which benefitted landlords and second homeowners, over first-time buyers trying to get a foot on the ladder. “Rather than seeing homes as the bedrock of a stable and successful le, the Conservatives treat housing as a commodity to be traded and profited from.”  First time buyers lost out in every region. In the South West, mortgages to first time buyers were down % on the previous year in April . In the North West, they were down % in March , and the East and West Midlands were down % in the same month. Ms Reeves added: “Labour is the true party of home ownership. Rather than robbing first-time buyers of their advantage, we would give them first dibs on new build homes, and stop the scandal of developments being sold off plan to overseas investors.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “Our temporary stamp duty cut helped to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating economic activity.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyFirst-time buyersMortgagesStamp dutyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His predecessor, Amanda Milling was driven around in an electric I-PACE Jaguar until she lost her job as party co-chair in September’s reshuffle. But just a month before the UK hosts world leaders at the COP climate conference in Glasgow, Mr Dowden opted to keep the petrol-powered car and driver he had in his previous job as Culture Secretary. A Tory source said: “Amanda Milling went for an electric car when she was offered as she thought it was important for the Conservative party chair to do their bit for the environment ahead of COP. “But Oliver clearly doesnapost feel the same. When he arrived at CCHQ he asked for a petrol one instead.” But a spokeswoman for Mr Dowden said: “He has a lovely driver and just wanted to keep working with him. Someone has got the wrong end of the stick.”  As Minister without Portfolio, Mr Dowden’s limousine is provided by the Government Car Service at taxpayer expense. Drivers come with a specic car, and while some ministers retain their driver and car when changing departments, not all do. Mr Dowden’s spokeswoman said he had “just kept same drivers from [his former department] as many ministers do when they move.”  In June, Mr Dowden helped launch the Tech Zero Taskforce at the CogX tech conference in London. He told attendees: “I hope this marks a turning point in our fight against climate change – and it’s right that the tech industry leads the charge.” But Mr Dowden has voted against a string of opposition motions in the Commons calling on the government to make commitments to tackle the climate crisis.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Jo, , said: “We had a queue of cars down the close and down the next street. “Everyone jumped on and supported him. He did it that well they asked to come back. “He was charging a fiver but everyone was giving him £.” It didn’t take long for a local businessman to offer Zykiah a permanent base to work from. Jason from Coal and Cotton Gin Bar reached out to the family saying they were “really impressed” by his work. They offered him a canopy outside the venue at weekends to clean local cars. Two years on, Zykiah, now aged , runs his own social media accounts and website.The youngster now cleans for the likes of huge stars including former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Love Island couple Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, and United footballer Scott McTominay. Jo continued: “He cleans for some Love Island stars.“It’s all from his social media. “Anyone who has a high-performance car comes to him but he does all cars. “And he’s all self-taught, he’s never done a course. He’s done it all online and designed his own flyers. “A lot of young lads message him asking how he started and he says with a bucket and sponge. “He had a bucket and sponge for the whole year before he knew how to use a valeting kit.“He went on Instagram, YouTube, any channel he could to watch the process.” Zykiah’s business, called DirtClean Manchester, charges £ for an outside and winter washes, mini valets for £, full valets for £ and king valets for £.One day, the year  pupil hopes to one day own a car valeting company in his own name and aims to have branches across the UK. Jo continued: “I feel so proud of him.

From his first match he endured a torrid of racist abuse which continued for three years - but  years later black footballers still suffer on and off the pitchEx-Cha player Paul Canoville says social media means players can be abused  ByLorraine King:,  Oct Ex-footballer Paul Canoville was on the edge of his seat as he watched the penalty shootout at the finals of the Euro . The nail-biting last minutes of the match would determineEngland would win their first major football tournament in  years. When black players Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka all missed their penalties Paul said he knew what would happen next. As Chaaposs first ever black player he was subjected to a catalogue of racist abuse which was so vile that he thought about walking off the pitch and never ing. Four decades on and the -year-old grandad said he knew Rashford, Sancho and Saka would have to endure the same but this time it wouldnapost just be on the pitch - it would be on social media.  He told the Mirror: At least with the abuse I faced it was at the match and once I finished playing football I could forget about it. But now social media allows black footballers to be abused   with very little done to stop it. When it comes to racism it has moved from the terraces to social media. This is the new  for racism in the sport and more needs to be done to wipe it out. Paul spoke to the Mirror exclusively after police made  arrests in connection with racist abuse towards the three black players back in July. The accused ranged in age from  to .  Chief Constable Mark Roberts, National Police Chiefsapos Council football policing lead, said: There are people out there who believe they can hide behind a social media profile and get away with posting such abhorrent comments. They need to think again - we have investigators proactively seeking out abusive comments in connection to the match and,they meet a criminal threshold, those posting them will be arrested. Paul told the Mirror: Taking a penalty is not an easy thing to do so for these three young players to receive abuse like this is sickening. But it has been going on for far too long.In , Paul signalled a welcoming change in football after being signed to Cha as black footballers at the top were far and few between. Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson, who all played for West Bromwich Albion and were affectionately known as aposThe Three Degreesapos, were among the small number of black players. Paul was not only the same age as Bukayo at the time but both grew up in Southall in west London so he resonates with the talented teenager. Saka is just  and from the same neck of the woods as me so I understand where heaposs coming from and itaposs a big thing to be representing his country at such a young age, he said. What happened to Saka and the others shows nothing has changed since the s when I was on the pitch but then racism isnapost just a football thing - itaposs a society thing.  Recalling the first time he was subjected to racist abuse, Paul said he was unaware of the clubaposs aposhistoryapos and he was full of pride when he ran on to the pitch for the first time. My belly was chewing me up as I was so nervous, he said.I heard shouting and then I realised they were shouting at me. We were playing against Crystal Palace so I thought it was their fans trying to put me off but then I realised it was from the Cha terraces.They were shouting n***er go home, calling me a golliwog and some even threw bananas at me. I was shocked. Everyone could hear what they were saying and no one said a thing or asked me how I was until my manager consoled me.  That was the beginning of the horric racist abuse Paul faced from his own fans whenever he played for his team. He said: It was at both home and away games and no one called it out. It was like it wasnapost happening as people just buried their heads in the sand. The National Frontwere big and firm back then. They would be outside the stadium giving out leaflets and no one dared to say anything.  I especially hated it when I was at home at Stamford Bridge as the fans would really give me hell. All I would hear is n****r go home. I remember one time I scored the first goal and the racist fans said it didnapost count because it was scored by aposthe n****rapos. This went on for three years and it affected my performance which meant I had to play twice as good as the other players. I must say that it was only a minority of fans but enough of them to smash my confidence. But, I had to play lip service and get on with it otherwise Iaposd be seen as the aggressor.  Paul said the turning point finally came when his team were playing Sheffield Wednesday in the Milk Cup and they were losing -. He explained: I was sitting on the subs bench and was called to the pitch. I scored two goals and thataposs when the racist fans were silenced. I hardly heard any chants after that. After leaving Cha, Paul played for Reading where he said he was welcomed by fans there with open arms.  It was very multicultural there so I wasnapost subjected to the same racism but you speak to any black footballer and they will have a story to tell you, he said. I really want to see something done now. Itaposs been  years since I had racist abuse hurled at me and it still continues today albeit on social media. These social media companies really need to take more responsibility. I knew that the minute those three players missed their penalties the racist abuse would come in thick and fast.  Fans have stopped throwing bananas on the pitch but they are doing the equivalent on social media websites. Enough is enough. Paul is also calling for more to be done to stop people using anonymous accounts to target black players. There needs to be some sort of identication process, he said . If you go to open a bank account you need proof of who you are so why canapost the same be asked for social media accounts  We need to make sure there is no  available for racists to target footballers like this. Paul is now using his ugly experiences on the pitch to help the next generation overcome any obstacles they may face. In  the dad-of-nine set up the Paul Canoville Foundation which aims to empower children and teach them more about the importance of ersity.  This includes Paul hosting workshops in schools where he delivers anti-bullying messages and gives talks to youngsters on how they can boost their confidence. He said: My foundation is very important to me. I want to ensure the next generation is strong and able to cope with issues like racism as it is sadly very much a part of our society.For more information about Paulaposs foundation visit paulcanovillefoundationMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Racism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But what about music  Well, the genre of music called ‘mathcore’ is dedicated to the world of mathematics and is all about aposbreaking boundariesapos. Described as a ‘subgenre of hardcore punk and metalapos, bands that fit into the genre usually emphasise complex rhythms. They do this through things like irregular time signatures, tempo changes, polymeters, angular melodies and peculiar chord possessions. Mathcore emerged in the s, and is displayed in bands like Converge, Coalesce, Botch, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Candiria. When describing ‘maths rock’ one Reddit user hit the nail on the head by saying: “It uses odd asymmetrical time signatures or constantly changing meters based on ious groupings of two and three. “Critics in the late s would describe this sound as mathematical and thataposs how it got its name.” Night In At Tiananmens, a mathcore band from Billings, Montana, aren’t shy to the unique genre, it’s their main focus, along with ‘grindcore’. Although the option to play mathcore music wasn’t a choice at first, drummer JR Anderson explained that they’d grown to aposlove the genre.apos He said: “I had been writing songs for what would become NIAT because I loved it. I wanted the intensity of grindcore but with the complexity of someone like The Dillinger Escape Plan. “In Montana, there isn’t anyone doing what Night In At Tiananmens is doing. NIAT has been around for three or four years now and during that time I’ve really grown to understand what mathcore is.Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by you can do that here.

So, what exactly drew the band to mathcore JR continued: “I believe, it’s a community of people who like a challenge. “In one way or another. I love playing this stuff knowing that I’m just a measure or note away from losing it. I get a rush playing this way.” The features of mathcore like tempo changes, aren’t just found in mathcore either, they’re also found in free jazz and ‘math rock.’ Mathrock isn’t as heavy as mathcore, and is described as a ‘progressive and indie rock’ displayed in bands like Coheed and Cambria and King Crimson. One Reddit user, describing the mathematical music genres, said: “Instead of going --- ---, it goes ------ ------.” Seems simple enough.

Gordon Allen, , was rushed to Salford Royal in an air ambulance in  after suffering an asthma attack, but when doctors saw his chest they did further tests. He said he couldnapost believe it when he got his diagnosis of stage two breast cancer. At the time Gordon was  and says there was little information out there on male breast cancer.He told the Manchester Evening News his boss even questioned it until he saw paperwork.Gordon, from Swinton, Manchester, is now speaking out about his diagnosis in a bid to make men aware that it can happen to them as well as women.He is speaking out as part of the Men Get Breast Cancer Too campaign from charity Walk the Walk this male breast cancer awareness week. Eight months before his asthma attack, Gordon, who has one daughter with his we Jayne, noticed changes to his left nipple. He felt pain, it had inverted and it had begun to crumble. “I didn’t go to the doctors to get it checked,” he told the Manchester Evening News. “I thought it looked odd, particularly when it went hard and started to flake. “But there was no publicity back then, it was the last thing I thought it was. “It might seem strange but I never knew men could get it and so it never occurred to me that’s what it was.” Despite being fit to go home from the hospital a few days later following his asthma attack, Gordon was aware something wasn’t right when they made him stay. He underwent a mammogram and biopsy and was then told the shocking news. “Once I got to the hospital, they took one look at my chest and hit the roof,” Gordon said. “They weren’t saying a great deal to me but my sister was an orderly nurse at the hospital – she did a bit of asking around for me and I got the impression from her that there was potentially something serious going on with my breast. “When they eventually told me, I couldn’t believe it. But I felt fairly calm about it.” Gordon credits this outlook to his Christian faith, feeling that it was up to God whether he lived or not, as well as a male nurse that helped him. “When everyone had left, I couldn’t help but just stare at the ceiling, I couldn’t get my head around it. “But this wonderful male nurse came and said to me, ‘well you know what it is now, the next thing is treatment.’ “And I thought, ‘he’s right. There’s no point getting all worked up, let’s get on with it and seewe can get it dealt with’.” Gordonaposs close friends and family were supportive of what he was facing but he says he felt stigma over his condition from his boss in the motor trade. Within  days of being diagnosed, he had a mastectomy to remove his breast and had to have time off from his job. “I hadn’t worked there very long which didn’t help,” Gordon continued. “He wouldn’t [his boss] believe it until I brought the paperwork in. He questioned, ‘you’ve got breast cancer  Men don’t get breast cancer. I’ve never heard of that’. “And then when I went back to work after my breast op, he never spoke to me again. Just passed by me and never talked to me.” Gordon didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy and recovered well from the surgery, however was put on hormone therapy Tamoxen. In the months to follow, Gordon learnt the reality of how rare it was to have breast cancer as a man, and still to this day hasn’t met another man in person with the same condition. In the UK, around  men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and around  of these men will die each year. That’s almost a quarter at  per cent. As with women, it usually affects older men aged  and above, however it can be found in men of any age, like Gordon in his mid-forties, who also has no history of breast cancer in his family. When he would attend routine GP appointments to check how he was doing on the treatment, he found he caught the attention of student doctors, who would come into his appointments often. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of these doctors, five years in training, that didn’t have a clue what it was, they didn’t realise it was breast cancer, Gordon said. Gordon felt like a ‘guinea pig’ at times, as he was one of the first men to go on the hormone therapy. His we argues that it caused him to have mood swings at certain times of the month, similarly to PMT - premenstrual syndrome - when he first started out. And after seven years, he was able to come off it, though Gordon found this ‘frightening’. “It was a crutch in a way, so it was quite scary coming off it,” he said. “I thought that was going to protect me. It was down to my body then, no more medicine, which was rather frightening.” Whilst Gordon came off medication for the cancer, he was still on antidepressants as he battled with the aftershock of what had happened to him. Ever since the trauma, he’s regularly checked his remaining breast and around his scar, and encourages other men to do the same. Looking back, Gordon believes he’s lucky to be alive. He added: “I was lucky because I did nothing about it and it was just a bit of luck with the asthma attack. “I can’t believe how daft I was and blasé that I didn’t do anything about it. If I was left to my own devices I would have died, no question. “I want to get the message over to many men as possible that you can get breast cancer and also for men going through it, it’s not necessarily a death sentence. “Any change at all, get to the doctors immediately, don’t mess around”.To find out more about Walk the Walk’s awareness campaign, go to www.walkthewalk.org mengetbreastcancertoo.Comment MORE ON HospitalsBreast cancerTherapyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The woman, a TikTok user, shared her experience in a video where she told about customersapos behaviour and how they would leave the fitting rooms wearing new items theyaposd just picked up on the shop floor.The social media user @kdr from London explained how shoppers would abandon their old clothes and swap them for new ones in the changing rooms.They would hand their old outfit, including dirty underwear to the shop assistant. She rolls her eyes in the TikTok video and said: When people handed in their own clothes to the fitting room and left wearing new ones from Primark when I worked there. She adds that there is a bonus point when it was their underwear. Her confessions prompted other Primark employees to recall their gross experiences while working for the budget clothes chain. One wrote I found a used sanitary towel stuck to the mirror when I checked the fitting rooms. Another posted an emoji of a man vacuuming which read: Me when I worked in Primark and a toddler p***** on the floor three minutes before the end of my sht. A third response claimed customers had disgusting behaviour: Someone pooped in a bag on my sht and left it there. One admitted she had handed their old clothes back to the shop assistant before walking out with her new clothes.  They said: -year-old me thought I was slick wearing old black jeans in and new black jeans out. But Georgia Ponton, , from Kettering, revealed how to benefit from free hanger and seasonal items in her TikTok post. In her response, she says: aposIf you go up to someone that is working on the till and say aposCan I have a bag of hangers apos then they will give it to you, she said.

Following his dadaposs footsteps, Edward Kercher bought the terraced house in January this year to take on a project.The -year-old said his dad renovates properties full time, which gave him the confidence to buy a run-down property and then bring it back to le.The architectural technologist said he has saved tens of thousands by doing as much work as he could himself but, with a full-time job, it has him taken ten months. Edward, from Southampton, has been working in the house after work and at weekends, having spent just over £, so far on the transformation.  He added: I work on my house renovation project after work and at the weekends. “Basically any free moment I get out of work I try to use as time to work on my house. Iaposve saved in the region of tens of thousands. I have lost out in terms of time as it has taken me a lot longer but I have saved a vast amount of money.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror After moving, he ripped up the flooring and started stripping the walls. He also slowly stripped the paint of the original staircase to restore it.The first-time buyer ordered a kitchen from Howdenaposs for just over £,, including all the appliances, and then installed it himself.In the bathroom, he bought and installed the bathroom suite and added modern metro tiles, for a total of £. Edward decided to go for classic Herringbone flooring for the entire ground floor, costing £.  Upstairs, he sanded the original floorboards and spend £ on hiring equipment. Recognising the history of the house, Edward wanted to keep some original features in the modern design and, luckily, he was able to refresh the original doors, staircase and fireplaces. He said: “I think it is much better to try and do restoration rather than strip out and introduce new features. “I think the contrast between old and new works well.”  However, Edward did have to get some professional help after plastering one bedroom upstairs as, realising how time-consuming it would be to do the whole house, he hired a plasterer to tackle the ground floor and all the artex ceilings. He also hired a plumber, who moved his boiler into the loft. In total, he has spent just over £, so far on the transformation.  Now all that is left to finish are some smaller jobs to add the final touches and fill the house with furniture. When I was younger he [his dad] was always remodelling the homes that we lived in, he continued. I think that is one of the main reasons I have always been interested in doing something myself the same way. It gave me the confidence to buy a run-down property and know that I would be able to do all of the work myself to bring it back to le.”  Once heaposs finished everything, Edward plans to have the house surveyed and will decide whether to sell it and start a new project or live in it for a while. Although he doesnapost want to share how much he paid for the house originally, he believes all the work he has done has already helped it go up in value.Full Kitchen cost including appliances: £ Full Bathroom fixtures fitting and tiles: £ Herringbone flooring for the entire ground floor: £ Sanding equipment hire for first floor rooms: £ Rooflight in Kitchen: £ Tradesman Plastering the ground floor and all the artex ceilings: £ Plumber moving my boiler into the loft: £ Front door: £ Furniture so far sofa, two double beds and mattresses etc: £ Miscellaneous items : £ Total £, Edward believes that, since he bought the house, it has gone up in value by up to £,. He said: I have kept a close eye on house prices on my road and with the recent capital growth of property and my recent refurbishment I believe, within the nine months I have had the place, I have added around £,. For those looking to start their own home renovation, Edward added: “Itaposs so easy to fall into the trap of feeling overwhelmed and underskilled when it comes to DIY and property in general. You just need to take a risk sometimes and you always end up figuring things out. I went into this with zero knowledge and experience and now I have people asking me every day how I am so competent in DIY  renovation,you believe you will enjoy DIY and property, go for it, I promise you wonapost regret it.

KFC is doing just that by encouraging people to spice things up to mark the launch of its tasty new Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only. So to join in the fun, weaposre championing people who have challenged themselves to try new things, including Jenny Holden who has ed head first into wild swimming. The forty-seven-year-old mum of ten-year-old twins from Lichfield, Staffordshire, explains that she was in search of a new challenge, and one that would bring some excitement to her le.  ‘With my children a bit older, and less dependent on me, I found myself with a little bit more time for myself, and I wanted to use it doing something fun,’ says Jenny who runs her own PR company Chorus Communications. ‘Especially post lockdowns, with so much time spent at home, being sedentary and growing bored of my normal activities, I was craving a new hobby, and one that would really exhilarate me.’ A friend suggested Jenny try wild swimming at a quarry near her home and Jenny decided to give it a go, albeit with some nerves. ‘I’m a keen swimmer but the idea of swimming in that sort of environment was completely new to me. Also, wouldn’t it be freezing  I was intrigued enough to give it a go though, and took my first dip in August with one of my sons. ‘Plunging into the water, my first thought was – wow it’s cold! But actually, once you become acclimatised to the water temperature it feels wonderful. That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week. It’s nothing like swimming in a pool, it’s both exciting and soothing, brilliant for body and mind. ‘It’s definitely going to get a bit nippier as we go into winter but I’m ready for the challenge!’ So in the spirit of taking the plunge and trying something new, e into a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it is only around for a limited period, available until November .Download the app, head in store or order online.

The Manchester Evening News sent feature writer Dianne Bourneaposs visit to Manchester Britannia Hotel, to give her personal verdict on whether Britannia rules or not.Hereaposs what she had to stay about her stay:  Iaposm not quite sure where to start with my visit to Manchesteraposs Britannia Hotel. With the ONE HOUR queue to check in  With the bedroom without a window, stuffy and sweltering with an ageing air con that I couldnapost get to work  Or perhaps with the eye-watering £ price for it all  Not forgetting, of course, the people who kindly woke me at .am by screaming in the hotel corridors at the injustice of it all  So, anyway, when I got my booking information through for the Britannia I was surprised to see that check-in was from pm - which seemed a little late - but I figured that would still give me time to get ready ahead of the event I was attending at pm. I arrived at bang on pm at the Britannia, and my heart sank when I saw a queue already forming outside of the grand double doors for check-in. Waiting around does allow you to appreciate the grandeur of this th century building - the sweeping staircase and huge chandelier on entrance really are impressive, while Graeco-Roman style statues dot the alcoves and windows around the lobby.  However I became sick of the sight of the Roman Gods after staring at them for a FULL HOUR while waiting to get to the front of the queue. I got chatting to some nice people next to me in the queue - when I overheard them talking about how much they had paid for their room. And then they all got to have a good laugh when I told them how much I was paying. Because it turns out I was being well and truly ripped off with the £ charge - the two women from Scotland revealed theyaposd booked their double roomfor £ just three days before their stay .  A couple originally from South America revealed they were paying £ for their double. To say I felt ripped off at this stage would be an understatement. When I told them all my room was £ with NO WINDOW I honestly think they thought I was joking. Ah, you will be in the penthouse for that price, they said. No no, itaposs a room with no window, I tried to explain, but still they laughed. Finally, finally when I got to the check-in desk, there was no apology or explanation for the delay, just the request for my name.  Does it always take this long  I asked. And he reckoned it was just because it was a busy Saturday night in Manchester. Although when I later looked on TripAdvisor, I can see there have been numerous complaints about the hour-long check-ins for weeks now. I felt annoyed that it gave me less than an hour to get myself showered and ready to get to my event. But I felt even more annoyed on behalf of some shirtless males I encountered in the corridors as I made my way to my room.  They were very apologetic about their state of undress and the contents of their luggage all over the floor, but explained to me they needed to get changed quickly as they were already late for an event and just couldnapost wait any longer in the ridiculous queue for check-in. Itaposs just not on to pay for a hotel room and then not even be able to get into it, is it  I arrived at my room, having noted that room numbers on the doors were in a font that might best be described as Prisoner Cell Block H. Once inside my ground floor bedroom, the first thing that struck me was the wave of heat. Yes, I knew there was no window when I booked, but I had foolishly thought this would be in some way compensated by a modern form of air conditioning system. No such luck. An ancient looking grid was high on the wall, with a silver switch control  that was not exactly screaming digital age at me. While a little blue light flickered on the temperature setting, no such light was emerging from the fan switch. I tried and tried but nothing happened. Naturally, my first thought was to ring reception, but, funnily enough, given the fact there was still a queue out of the door at check in, there was no answer. And there was no way in hell I was going back out to queue for another hour to speak to someone. Aside from the heat, the room itself was pretty basic with old-fashioned dark furniture, and plain magnolia walls punctuated by two dirty round marks above the bedhead. But the bedding all looked clean and the bed itself felt comfy.  The TV remote was wrapped in a film with a sanitised sticker on it, and coffee and teas were also wrapped in a bag next to the kettle and cups to keep them clean. Above the skirting board appeared to be the power mains switches with the warning sign Danger  volts above it, which I found a little unsettling. The bathroom also looked to be clean, although when I touched pretty much anything in the shower it fell off in my hands - the soap dispenser, the shower power control and temperature ring. I mean, I was able to put them straight back on again so they all still ed ok, but not exactly the Ritz levels of quality is it  I was getting so hot now in the room that I thought Iaposd best just get cleaned up and changed as quickly as I could to get out into some fresh air.  When I ed to the hotel after attending my event, there was at least a blessing that the temperature had dropped outside by a few degrees so the heat of the bedroom was not quite as unbearable - although my flannel pyjamas were certainly not required for the sleep. Well, I say sleep. I was rudely awakened just after am by loud banging and crashing in the corridor, and a chap who sounded rather upset, presumably, having finally managed to check in to his room. He was shouting: I f***ing paid £... for THIS . Which I might have had some sympathy for, had I not forked out £... for THIS.  I settled back to sleep, only to be woken again around an hour later at .am by what sounded like a crowd disturbance on the street outside - not having a window I was unable to check what exactly it was that was happening. All that said, the bed was comfy and after the noisy interruptions it was a comfortable sleep. Waking at am I headed off to reception to complain about the heat of the room and the air conditioning not working. The man at the front desk said immediately would you like a plug-in fan  which gave me the impression I was not the first person to make this complaint. No, itaposs not worth it now I said. But I made the point they might want their hotel technical team to take a look at it so the next person doesnapost have to suffer in there. Heading down to Jennyaposs Restaurant in the basement for my buffet breakfast was perhaps the highlight of my stay.  Fine dining it ainapost, but the good old-fashioned all-you-can-eat fry up buffet was plentulyou were after a cooked breakfast - and there was quite a pile of fresh fruit too. I mean, donapost get me wrong, the sausage was like a salty fat stick and the mushrooms looked like theyaposd long ceased their status as vegetable, but it gets major brownie points for hosting what for me is the holy grail of hotel breakfasts - limitless fried bread. However, I could not forgive the god-awful coffee which tasted unlike any hot liquid I think Iaposve ever drunk before. Perhaps I picked the wrong jug of badly-brewed stuff, but I was not going to go and try another. Mercully, there was no queuing for check out, as you just popped your room key in a box on your way out. And, seeing the lobby empty, you can appreciate what a grand old building this really is, and what poteI couldnapost help but notice the one thing definitely not in short supply at the Britannia was racks and racks stuffed with postcards of the grand old building, all around the reception, should you wish to send a reminder to a loved one of your stay.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

We have asked Britannia Hotels for comment about the pricing scale for rooms, and the issues raised at my stay with check-in and the air conditioning, but there was no reply at the time of publishing. My overall take away from this stay is just the sheer rip off of the pricing. The windowless room is not the worst hotel room Iaposve ever stayed in here in Manchester but itaposs the one I felt most ripped off in. If you get this style of room at a budget price, then it offers reasonable accommodationyou just need somewhere to bed down for a few hours and shower . But for the £ paid for my visit, Iaposd have been better off booking a taxi to get me home - heck I could probably have got a chauffeur-driven limo for that price.

And it seems that the Duchess of Cambridge is no dferent after she was previously spotted popping into her local Sainsburys to stock up on Halloween outfits for Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Kate was seen at the supermarket on the Hardwick Industrial Estate, Norfolk, in  and was overheard asking some of the children in the store what they were going to dress up as. George and Charlotte were with their mum and followed her around as she did her shopping.  She later used the self-service checkouts, where she purchased her Halloween goods. Mum-of-four Kathy Whittaker later spoke of her shock to see Kate browsing the supermarket clothes while a brawny six-foot bodyguard lingered close by. Kathy explained: Another shopper said that Kate was in the shop near the clothing and pointed where she was to me. I just couldnapost believe it.

She was with Charlotte and George looking at Halloween outfits but her bodyguard was kind of watching people with phones and telling them no pictures. I managed to get the photo as she was at the self-service check out. You just donapost expect it to happen, you think Kate would shop in Waitrose or Harrods.  However, itaposs not the first time Kate has been spotted in a Sainsburyaposs. She was also seen browsing the clothing section of the supermarketaposs Kingaposs Lynn branch, which isnapost far from the familyaposs countryside home Anmer Hall, in . While in , she was spotted perusing the aisles of discount store The Range in King’s Lynn. Teacher Sarah Daniels told how she saw Kate with George and Charlotte in the arts and craft aisle before they moved on to the toy section, where George apparently showed interest in ‘dinosaur slime’. Mrs Daniels told the Daily Mail that at one point Charlotte sat on the floor and was told by her mother, dressed casually in jeans, low-heeled boots and a jacket: Get up, poppet. And when George asked about the slime, she claims she didn’t register a response from the prince’s mother. Maybe slime wasnapost within their budget  Comment MORE ON Prince GeorgePrincess CharlotteKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paula Tfin passed away two days after a car she was a passenger in smashed into a garden wall while being pursued by police in Washington, Tyne and Wear.The -year-old died in hospital after the smash left her with catastrophic injuries too serious to survive, ChronicleLive reports. Driver Bradley Webb - who drove at over mph through residential streets before losing control - has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and Paulaaposs daughter Amie has now revealed her devastation. The -year-old has said she is comforted by the thought her mum is now back with her beloved seven-year-old son Adam, who died after he plunged ft to the ground from scaffolding near his home in .  Amie said: She was so strong, she lived for her kids, but she never got over what happened to Adam. It just totally messed her whole le up. She always believed she would be with Adam one day and that does comfort me. Paula was a happy devoted mum before her world was ripped apart by Adamaposs death  years ago. His horric death came just weeks after Paulaaposs baby daughter Angel was stillborn, but the mum-of- battled through the unimaginable pain for the sake of her other children and remained the rock they all relied on. Back in , Paula told the Mirror : I feel like my heart has been ripped out.I have lost two children in a month and I donapost know how I am going to cope. Adamaposs final words were I love you, mum as he left home to play. He had been playing out with his big brother Dylon when he scaled the scaffolding, near his home in Roche Court. Dylon ran home to tell his mum that Adam had fallen and Paula raced to where her boy was. But there was nothing she could do to save her boy, and Adam died in her arms.  At the time, she said she could tell straight away that he was dead, adding: I picked him up in my arms and he felt limp. People were trying to resuscitate him but it wasnapost working. We waited  minutes for an ambulance but it felt like a letime. He came up just before the accident, gave me a big kiss and said, aposI love youapos. Iaposm so glad I got to hear that before he died.Paula told the Chronicle in  she had blamed herself for allowing Adam to go out that day, saying she was trapped in a world of what-s and that she had been haunted by guilt since her sonaposs death.However, after a construction firm was fined £, for safety blunders, which led to the youngster’s death, Paula said she could finally forgive herself and start to move on.  Lovell Partnerships Limited, which erected the scaffolding for a one-off repair but left it there for  days, admitted responsibility for blunders which led to the tragedy. It was prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive and fined the sum for a breach of safety regulations. Despite being freed from the guilt that had plagued her, Paulaaposs grief cast a dark shadow over the rest of her le. Mum-of-four Amie said her mum slept with the t-shirt Adam had been wearing the day he died under her pillow every night. Paula had been at Amieaposs house, in Hetton-le-Hole, enjoying a few drinks in the hours before the crash in August. Despite living close by she accepted a lt home off Webb, who is the brother of Amieaposs partner Jimmy, Amie explained. But the Renault Megane they were in crashed into a garden wall on Dairy Lane in Houghton-le-Spring, at around .am the following morning.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror The car was being pursued by officers from Durham Constabulary at the time. Paula and another female passenger were taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmaryin Newcastle. . Meanwhile Amie was mistakenly told that it was her brother, -year-old brother Nathan, who lived with Paula, who had been injured in a crash. Frantic with worry she rushed to their home to look for her mum. And when Amie saw her brother and notice her mumaposs bed had not been slept in she was hit by the devastating reality. I had goosebumps from my head to my toes, I was a mess, Amie explained. Then the police knocked on the door. They said we needed to get all the family members to the RVI.  Paula underwent three major operations as medics battled to save her. But her injuries were too severe and she passed away on August  surrounded by he family. Paula was cremated last month with Adamaposs T-shirt in her coffin and her children are still struggling to come to terms with their loss. Her eldest son Darren said the tragedy had come just as things were starting to look up for his mum, who was in a happy relationship with her new partner. My mam has always been my rock. I used to go and see her every day, the -year-old said. I think she was stuck in the past. I think she was stuck in that day that Adam passed. But she was never selfish. She would rather help someone  that help herself. But everything was on the up for her. She had her new boyfriend and you could tell she was happy. Itaposs just not fair. Amie now wears a locket every day with her mumaposs ashes in it. She was very well-known around here, she said. Everybody loved her. She never stood still. She was always on the go. She was all about her kids. She gave us a good childhood. The Christmas and birthday presents were always piled up. Webb, , of Queen Street, Hetton-le-Hole, has also pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving without insurance and without a licence.

Chantelle Welsh kept quiet about the appalling incident for several hours before taking the little boy to hospital but repeatedly lied about how he had been injured - which led to her own brothers falling under suspicion and being detained in custody.The tot’s horrying catalogue of injuries included complex skull fractures, multiple eye socket fractures as well as a broken right arm and left leg, reported the Liverpool Echo. Liverpool Crown Court heard that the -month-old had “a large boggy swelling” to his head which he needed emergency surgery to reduce. He was discharged from Alder Hey Hospital after ten days and has fortunately physically recovered but there are concerns he may suffer psychologically in the long term. Welsh, , also has an older son but both have since been taken off her. The court heard that the defendant, who is now pregnant by another man, is unlikely to ever get her sons back and social services are involved in her le.  Welsh, of St Domingo Vale, Anfield, had pleaded guilty to child neglect involving failing to get medical help for the victim. Jailing her for  months Judge Garrett Byrne said: “A doctor refers to the injuries as would be seen in a serious car crash. “It is impossible to determine the long term psychological effect this trauma will have on this child, all one can say is there is the potential for long term psychological harm.” He told Welsh, who was dressed completely in baby pink, that her limited cognitive ability reduced her culpability but said the aggravating factors were “the time you took to seek medical attention and the lies told to the professionals which resulted in innocent people being arrested and detained, namely your brothers. Judge Byrne said it was “a shocking case” and she had “told a pack of lies” and it was only three months later that she started telling the truth. He said he had consideredhe could suspend the sentence on Welsh, who has no previous convictions, “but simply it was so serious only immediate sentence of custody can be justied.” John Williams, prosecuting, said that on the afternoon of February  last year the boy was taken to hospital by Welsh and her then partner. The baby had signicant swelling to his right eye which was completely closed and when examined he was found to have multiple injuries.  He listed the fractures the child had suffered as well as a perforated right ear drum and bruising to his right flank and abdomen. “There was no reasonable explanation as to how he had suffered these extensive injuries. “Neither she nor her partner were able to provide any explanation for the injuries. The nature and location of the injuries was such that clinicians rapidly concluded they were non-accidental and were indicative of signicant abuse.” Mr Williams said that the medics also concluded that the injuries had been caused on the day he was presented at hospital. The police and social services were notied and Welsh was questioned in the early hours of the next morning at hospital. She said she was unable to understand how he had suffered such injuries and he had not complained. It was only when she gave him paracetamol as he was hot that she and her mum realised his arm was floppy and decided to take him to hospital. Her two brothers, who lived in the same house as Welsh, were arrested as potential perpetrators as was her partner, who had not stayed at the hospital. The brothers were “detained for a signicant period of time. “ She was not in a relationship with the father of either of her sons and had only recently formed a relationship with the boyfriend. He did not live with her but he had been there overnight February  last year.  When interviewed she denied that her partner or brothers were involved in causing the injuries. Mr Williams said that the brothers were entirely innocent but she had lied about the partner. In family court proceedings which ran alongside the criminal proceedings Welsh admitted that her partner had inflicted the injuries. In an impact statement the victim’s paternal grandmother said the telephone call telling her about his injuries was “the worst news in the family’s le.” She said that the child, who the court heard had gone through a period of self-harming, was “more loved than he could ever want to be” and described the bond he has with her, his grandfather and his dad as “amazing.” Martine Snowdon, defending, said, “Her criminality flows from what happened after the infliction of these injuries. Her culpability is failing to act appropriately since she witnessed it.” She took him to hospital after a delay of about three hours and there is no evidence of any exacerbation of his physical condition as a result of the delay.” Miss Snowdon said that she knew her partner “had some involvement in crime and believed it to be drugs. He recently had a domestic violence conviction but she says she had no awareness of that”. Her telephone messages to him showed her immaturity with her telling him she loved him but no response from him. She had no awareness of the domestic violence background at the time he was in the bedroom with her and the injuries occurred. Miss Snowdon said no one would have known what had gone on in the bedroomshe had not gone on to tell the truth. She said: “She made a terrible mistake and she is deeply remorseful. She is deeply regretful of what she did. “She has spent approaching two years coming to terms that she is not getting these children back, probably for ever, and certainly for the foreseeable future.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Alder Hey hospitalCourt caseSocial servicesCrimeDomestic violence\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Taren Maywald, , began putting on weight after childbirth when she had three children in the space of two years. Her eldest daughter, Pryscilla, , was born in , followed by her twin boys, Parker and Preston, , in , which meant she had little time to sht her baby weight.But the mum-of-four has struggled with her weight ever since, and over the past decade continued to pile on the pounds, with an unhealthy diet and worrying lack of exercise, HullLive reports.In  her youngest was born, and it dawned on Taren thatshe didnapost lose weight, her daughteraposs childhood would pass her by just as it had with her other children.  Weighing  pounds, she decided her best chance at losing weight was to travel to Mexico to undergo le-saving gastric sleeve surgery. In August , she went under the kne with the risk of never waking up from surgery, and came out the other side having lost % of her stomach.Taren, originally from Tarboro, North Carolina, said : I was told the surgery was a huge risk by the doctors but I didnapost care. I wanted to give myself the best opportunity of losing weight, and the surgery was a tool which allowed me to do that The procedure literally shrinks your stomach and restricts what you can physically eat. It stopped me binging and forced me to eat like a normal person, and straight away the results started to show. When Alice was born it drove me to change my le, as I was faced with missing her childhood because of my weight. I already missed so much of my other three childrenaposs lives and I was determined not to let it happen again. For a month after, Tarenaposs surgery seemed to have been a raging success, as she was steadily losing weight with every day that passed. However, at the end of September the stay-at-home mum started to suffer severe abdominal pain and gut-wrenching cramps. When Taren went to the hospital, she was told that sheaposd developed kidney stones as a result of dehydration caused by the weight loss surgery. After being admitted to the urologist, she underwent surgery on her left kidney to remove all the stones - but things didnapost go to plan and several exploded inside of her. The shrapnel from the stones buried itself in her kidney causing dozens of cists to develop - which in the end proved an inoperable condition.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Six surgeries and almost a year later, her kidney had completely obliterated and she was forced to have it removed. Throughout the entire ordeal, despite living in excruciating pain, Taren was determined to build on the progress sheaposd made after her surgery. She went to the gym three times a week in-between hospital appointments and maintained her strict reformed diet. The results continued to show, and Taren now weighs a much healthier  pounds after shredding a whopping  and a half stone. Itaposs been the toughest year of my le without doubt but I donapost regret a single thing, she said. Going through this has made me a stronger person both physically and mentally, but most importantly it has enabled me to be a proper mom to Alice.

The National Police Chiefsapos Councilsaid there have been  confirmed reports of drink spiking in September and October across ious parts of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, plus  reports of some form of injection. On Friday afternoon, the NPCC said there were around  confirmed reports of drink spiking, but this figure was revised after more data was received. It said the number included both men and women, although the majority of cases featured young women. Alleged offences have taken place at licensed premises and private parties.Have you been a spiking victim  Tell us your story at webnews@mirror The  figure is based on data received from  police forces, and the NPCC said it is still to receive data from five forces which it expects over the weekend. The NPCC said  of the  reports of drink spiking were made to the politan Police. The NPCC lead for drugs, Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, said: Clearly these reports are very concerning. We are working at pace with forces, law enforcement agencies such as the NCA and other partners including the Home Office and universities to understand the scale of offending, establish any links between the allegations and ultimately bring any identied offenders to justice. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to administer poison in connection with a spate of reported drink-spiking incidents involving needles in Nottingham. Nottinghamshire Police said the men, aged  and , were arrested after receiving information from a member of the public on Wednesday, following a general appeal for help from a senior officer. The force said both had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve, and placed in police custody. The arrests are not being linked to any specic allegation of spiking by a needle, or contamination of a drink. Both men have since been released under investigation, the force said in an update. Nottinghamshire Police said it will deploy extra officers to ensure people can enjoy a safe night out.

Katie Brady Katie Brady blacked out after being spiked while dancing at a nightclub in Newcastle.The mum, , from Gateshead, kept placing her drink on a podium but can remember nothing after the incident.She told Chronicle Live : I was told afterward that I had gone to the toilets and the door staff had to carry me out and give me water.[They said that] my eyes had rolled back into my head and that later on, I had just walked away from the bar. She was able to contact a taxi driver she knows and was taken home but fell backwards while being sick in her bathroom. Ilana El-baz University student Ilana El-baz was filmed lying completely paralysed on a staircase after her drink was spiked while on a night out in Bristol.Shocking images show the -year-old in a dficult state after she ed home and struggled to get up a flight of stairs while her eyes rolled and her head slumped on to the bannister.

Zara OwenTeenager Zara Owen was spiked with an injection and has shared her horrendous experience of waking up confused with no memory of the night out.Last Monday, the University of Nottingham student, , from Surrey, was out at a club with friends but has no memory after getting a drink at the bar. Speaking to the Mirror, Zara said: When it hit me I had been spiked, I was so shocked to realise this had happened to me as I take the safety measures given very seriously. I cover my glasses and I cover my bottles to make sure nothing goes in, but to realise I had been injected is terrying. After speaking to her friends, they informed her that she had been acting out of character, not making any sense and wandering off alone and after finding her outside pals got her in a taxi home. The next morning, she was shocked to find a pin-prick after examining her leg properly - but is still waiting to see her GP after being left to wait eight hours in AE before giving up and going home.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON West Yorkshire PoliceNottinghamshire PoliceHome Officepolitan PoliceCCTVHospitalsCCTV footageCrimeAlcohol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Having been with the Duke since university, Kate had become accustomed to the conventions and around being a Royal, including a key rule the family lives by - never complain, never explain. The idea is that members of The Firm keep their personal matters quiet and put on a happy face in public, even when times are tough. And Kate has been no exception since joining, flashing her trademark stunning smile while carrying out royal duties in public and winning the hearts of the nation in the process. However, over the years, there have been rare flashes of more candid moments from The Duchess of Cambridge. In , while she was five months pregnant with Princess Charlotte, Kate travelled to New York with Wills, where she visited a childrenaposs centre to help the wrap Christmas presents. During the visit, she stopped wrapping for a moment to chat to some of the volunteers about their work - but was given a telling-off. Kate was told to keep wrapping, at which point she showed a cheeky, light-hearted glimpse of what she was really thinking. Going back to wrapping and doing what she was told, Kate rolled her eyes. But she diligently carried out the work as asked and continued wrapping the presents. As she finished her visit to the centre, Kate is said to have thoroughly enjoyed her day - despite the funny reaction she expressed earlier. Sheaposs not the only royal to have lost her cool in the past, with a few funny incidents showing members of the royal family showing their true feelings. Just last week, The Queen expressed her frustration at world leaders who havenapost fully committed to attending the COP summit in Glasgow in November. Her Majesty said it was irritating to see some leaders appearing to not take their responsibility seriously when it comes to reversing the effects of climate change. And itaposs not just the adults who let their true feelings slip in public - with the next generation of royals expressing their anger too. While visiting Hamburg with her parents in , Princess Charlotte, then two, had a classic toddler meltdown on the tarmac at the airport. As William took a book from Charlotte that her brother had been given as a gt, she stamped her feet and got on the floor, just like any other tot in a bad mood. Luckily, mum Kate was on hand to scoop up her daughter before her antics turned into a full-blown tantrum.

Guillain-Barre syndrome is a condition that has been noted in some people that have had the AstraZaneca jab, although experts insist the benefits of the Covid vaccine outweigh any possible side effects, The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas added Guillain-Barre syndrome as a possible side effect of the vaccine. The disorder affects the nerves mainly in the feet, hands and limbs, states the NHS. Numbness, pain or weakness can all be felt in patients with the condition which affects the immune system. For most people they will be treated and have a complete recovery but on rare occasions it can to lead to long term illness and may even be le-threatening.  Guillain-Barre syndrome had already been added to the side effects to the vaccine last month by the European Medicines Agency. Put in context, as of July  there had been  cases of the syndrome from million AstraZeneca doses given. Prof Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King’s College London, has said that the most common side effect of the AstraZeneca jab is a headache and then comes tiredness. He is a lead researcher on the ZOE Covid study that examines symptoms of Covid and side effects of vaccines. Prof Spector used data from app users to compile his list of common side effects.  He tweeted that one in five people statistically feel unwell after having a vaccine dose with younger people more so which is believed to be because their immune system is stronger. Chills and joint pain were also typical side effects that were found after taking the AstraZeneca, the Pfizer or the Moderna jabs. For the Pfizer and Moderna jabs the most common side effect, according to Prof Spector, was tiredness followed by a headache.

One viral tweet shared by a Tesco customer showed a cardboard image of asparagus placed where the actual vegetable should be. The tweet was captioned: Tesco have the fake asparagus out this morning. From afar, it could appear that the store had a full supply of the vegetable, but on approach, youaposd be disappointed. A Sainsburyaposs shopper replied to the tweet with a bizarre picture of her own. The woman shared a snap from inside a Sainsburyaposs store in Sherborne, saying that the supermarket was not even trying to make it look genuine.  The photograph, shared by Sharon Dale, showed empty pasta shelves at theLudbourne Road shop, with some of them filled with a cardboard insert.One person replied: Is dried pasta out of season too Speaking to Dorset Live, Sharon said she felt it drew attention to the lack of stock.She said: I have been reading a lot of comments about empty shelves and the cause .She said: I have been reading a lot of comments about empty shelves and the cause .  I thought it was a strange choice. I am already in Sainsbury’s so don’t need branded reminders. It draws attention to the lack of stockanything. A Sainsburyaposs spokesperson told The Mirror: Our colleagues and suppliers are working hard to make sure customers can find everything they need when they shop with us. Availability in some product categories may y but alternatives are available and stores continue to receive deliveries daily. The Mirror also contacted Tesco for comment.  It comes as a lack of lorry drivers and Brexit-related complications have caused queues at petrol stations and empty shelves in parts of the UK, while Felixstowe and other big ports around the world have suffered backlogs. As a result of the supply problems, the Department for Transportannounced plans to lt the limit on the number of deliveries foreign lorry drivers can make in the UK for up to six months. Currently, hauliers from the EU can only make up to two trips to drop off or pick up goods between locations in the UK within one week. Under the DfT proposal, there would be no restriction on the number of those journeys foreign lorry drivers can make over a two-week period before theyto their country of origin. Mr Shapps told Times Radio: “Christmas will go ahead. We’ll be able to see our friends and families. There will be food, there will be gts.“I do know that the entire world has a squeeze on its supply chain. That’s because we’re all coming out of this very long period of coronavirus, and the UK economy, perhaps particularly because we’ve got an expanding economy, the fastest-growing in the G, means that there are particular stresses and strains.“But we’re taking a whole range of measures, including one that I’m announcing today about the way that lorry drivers from abroad pick up and drop things off, the so-called cabotage rules. “And, under our changes, that will mean that they can, in an unlimited way by Christmas, pick up and drop off goods within this country within a -day period.” Comment MORE ON TescoSainsburysCoronavirusSupermarkets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sean Howarth, , met the victim and her friends at a nightclub in Manchesteraposs Gay Village - repeatedly complimenting her despite her telling him she had a boyfriend. Whilst on the dancefloor he offered one of her friends some cocaine, but she declined and he then offered to buy the group a drink, including the victim, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.After taking the drink, the woman had little recollection of what happened next, the Manchester Evening News reports. Rachel Faux, prosecuting, said: “At am her friend noticed the victim behaving in a strange manner, she was hyper and dancing in an unusual fashion. “The victim then had some sort of panic attack and went outside to vomit, which was unusual for her.  “The friend went back inside the club to retrieve their coats so they could go home and gave the victim her phone.” As she went inside, Howarth headed outside directly for the woman. By the time her friend went to meet her, both Howarth and the victim were gone. Despite calling her she received no reply until the following morning when Howarth called her back on the victim’s phone stating that the victim was with him at his hotel in Rochdale and that she was safe, and sent her back home in a taxi. When the girl arrived back she was ‘shaking and crying’ with no memory of why she ended up in a hotel room, why she was with Howarth, or why she woke up with her trousers half way down her legs. She was also without her phone and bank cards which were kept in her phone case. The following day, police attended at the Royal Toby Hotel, where Howarth was staying, and found class A drugs. The day after he was released on bail and went to a Cash Generator where he sold the victim’s phone for £. He later used this and the stolen money to buy drugs. In a further interview he claimed she had pulled down her own trousers and he began to touch her until he realised she had fallen asleep. CCTV later showed Howarth and the victim walking towards Bloom Street and getting into a taxi. They stopped at a McDonalds where he bought some food but she could be seen ‘slumped’ against the rear window. Pulling up at the hotel, Howarth helped her out of the car as she was unsteady on her feet. He told the night porter that she was his sister, that she was drunk and askedit was OK to bring her inside, the court heard. They felt ‘intimidated’ by Howarth and allowed it, but later witnessed her trying to ‘break free’ from Howarth and heard her saying “no no”. CCTV from inside the hotel showed Howarth carrying the girl over his shoulder to his room, before dropping her to the floor in order for him to retrieve his food he left at reception. As part of the police investigation, Howarth’s phone was seized and examined in the note section was the victim’s passwords and security information and a recording he had taken of himself sexually assaulting her. Following tests, the presence of cocaine was discovered in the victim’s urine, though she had confirmed to officers she did not, and would not take cocaine. In an emotional victim personal statement, the woman said her whole le had changed and she was no longer the ‘bubbly, sociable’ person she once was. She said she no longer goes out socialising with friends for a drink, she has panic attacks when in crowded places and has completely changed jobs. She said she has lost friends as a result, lost her confidence and initially felt like she was to blame for what happened to her. “He left me with so many unanswered questions: Why did he pick on me  How did he think doing something like that was OK ” she said. “It’s clear from his actions that his only priority was himself.” Howarth was said to have two previous convictions for breaching non molestation orders against a former partner. Mitigating, Keith Harrison said: “In his basis of plea, he states he did not seek to stalk anybody. This offence was not planned in the sense of prior to arriving and seeing the complainant. “These offences are totally disrespectful and serious. “He behaved in a totally unacceptable manner. “There are very many good elements to this man - he fell from grace.” Sentencing, Judge John Potter told him: “This offending amounted to a series of planned quite deliberate events leading to the depraved act of sexual assault which you filmed on your mobile phone. “You then stole from your victim’s phone with all the money she had and you then took her mobile phone for yourself. “The selection of your victim by you and thereafter objectying her by dragging her into the hotel room to sexually abuse her and then stealing from her is clear evidence, in my judgement, of predatory sexual offending. “You have, in many respects, destroyed her hopes and expectations she was entitled to have in her young le.” Howarth, of Newsome Road, Huddersfield, was jailed for seven years and two months, made subject of the Sex Offender’s Register for le and also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order indefinitely. He previously pleaded guilty to administering a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence, sexual assault, offering to supply a class A drug, theft and fraud. Detective Constable Russell Clarke, of Rochdale CID, said: The circumstances of this case are truly shocking and involved the premeditated violation of a young woman. Howarth gave her no consideration as he exploited her in order to satisfy his own sexual and financial greed. He added: Throughout the investigation, Howarth failed to take full responsibility for his predatory behaviour. He changed his story on a number of occasions, spinning a web of lies as he persisted in trying to distance himself from what he had done.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVBanksCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtCrimeCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was a really unusual sensation. “I turned around to my friend and said, ‘I think I’ve just been injected’. She looked at my arm and said there was a needle mark and we looked around trying to see who might have done it. “It doesn’t bear thinking about what could have happenedmy friend hadn’t been there.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  “I think I was targeted when she had stepped away and I was on my own at the bar, making me more vulnerable. Most of my friends had already headed home but thankfully we stuck together.” Rebecca and her friend, who were drinking in the Rubber Soul bar in the city centre on September , went straight back to their hotel as she began to feel sick and drowsy. She said: “I was mainly a bit fuzzy, confused and quite shook up, feeling a bit nauseous and dizzy.” She later had a medical check-up, including HIV and hepatitis tests. Doctors told Rebecca that whoever injected her did not know what they were doing because they missed her blood stream. She said: “The doctors think it was probably muscle relaxants which could have temporarily paralysed me, but we will never really know until we find out who did it.” It was only this week after seeing other victims of needle spiking come forward that Rebecca reported her ordeal to police. Nationwide, cops have reported  needle spiking attacks in the past two months and  cases of drink spiking.  Nottinghamshire police have received  reports this month of people being spiked by something sharp. That includes three within just  hours this week. It coincides with an overall rise in reports of spiking using both needles and drinks this month. Rebecca said: “Afterwards I thought I was being paranoid and going mad, and I tried to put it to the back of my mind. “I think there was an assumption it was just students, but my story shows anyone considered to be an easy target can be attacked.” Two men in Nottingham and one in Lincoln were detained in connection with spiking attacks last weekend. An  and -yearold remain in custody in Nottingham on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison. It is still unknown exactly what drug is being used to spike victims.  Jo Cox-Brown, founder of Night Time Economy, delivered anti drink spiking training on Friday to Nottingham venues. She said it is crucial to report a spiking to police as soon as possible because date-rape drugs like rohypnol and GHB leave the system within  hours. She said: “The earlier you report it, the more likely the perpetrators can be found immediately.” Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered police to urgently investigate the rise of spiking.

Abby Younis, who works as a financial crime consultant, had started to feel aposout of sortsapos in January . Abby, who lives with her husband Brian in Litherland, Merseyside, thought she needed a break to get her back to her old, energetic self.She told the Liverpool Echo : I was working really hard and getting migraines and feeling tired.I just wanted to take some time off to get fit again as normally Iaposm a very energetic and into my fitness but I had put on some weight and couldnapost breathe properly. Taking time off, she caught up with family and friends and booked a once-in-a-letime holiday to Tanzania. However, after ing from holiday she still felt unwell and in constant need of having a wee. She said: I was breathless all the time. I had a lot of pains in my abdomen - at times they were quite paralysing, I couldnapost move. After dismissing it as something Iaposd eaten or time of the month I thought it was time to go to the doctors.  After a visit to her GP, it was suggested her problem may be bladder related and she was sent to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital for tests. Expecting hospital staff to tell her nothing was wrong, Abby was shocked to hear that scans had revealed a mass in her stomach. They didnapost knowthe mass was coming from her oies or bowel and so Abby was sent for further tests at the Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital and the Clatterbridge Centre. Initial results from a CT scan revealed that she had a pulmonary embolism - a blockage in one of the arteries in her lung which explained her breathlessness. Results from further blood test revealed more sinister news as Abby was told by doctors that they suspected the mass in her stomach was cancer. Abby said: It had got quite aggressive by that stage. They said my mass was too big to have a biopsy. The only way to knowit was cancer for sure was to undergo surgery. Following the shock news, doctors raced her appointment for surgery through as quickly as possible as wards were beginning to close due to the pandemic. Abby said: Before I left my home for the hospital, I left it in a way that I wouldnapost come back. Normally Iaposm such a positive person but because of where we were at the time. I thought Iaposve possibly got cancer, I know Iaposve got an embolism, and thereaposs Covid out there. I thoughtmy lungs or my cancer doesnapost get me, then Covid would. I couldnapost see past that moment in time. Three weeks after surgery to remove two masses in her stomach, Abbyaposs consultant called her into the hospital. She said: The consultant said they found something that we were expecting and something that they were not expecting. They had found two separate cancers growing at dferent rates. The more progressed one was oian cancer and that had spread across my bowels. Luckily they scraped off the cancer and didnapost have to remove part of my bowel. And separately I had endometrial cancer growing, which is cancer of the womb. Following Abbyaposs successful surgery to remove the tumours, she was offered chemotherapy which she declined unless they reappear again some time in the future. However, Abbyaposs surgery brought on whataposs known as a surgical menopause. She said: They tell you all the side effects before you have surgery and one of those is menopause - surgical menopause for people like me going through hormonal cancers. But you donapost know what that means, because Iaposve never heard anyone speak about it. Itaposs more of a crash bang wallop rather an easing in to the menopause. I had a lot of sleepless nights, I was in a lot of pain because of the surgery. I had terrible brain fog and hot flushes which were a complete nightmare. It was like somebody throwing a bucket of boiling hot water over me. Because Abbyaposs cancers were hormonal related she wasnapost allowed Hormone Replacement Therapyto help with her symptoms as it could cause another cancer. To help other women who are experiencing the menopause but canapost receive HRT, Abby is fundraising to buy Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital equipment to provide a new laser treatment that alleviates some of the symptoms of menopause. The treatment is currently only available privately and Abby is trying to raise as much money as she can to make the treatment available on the NHS. So far, she has had support from celebrities like Davina McCall, who sent Abby a personal video in support of her campaign. John Lewis are also hosting a fashion and beauty event in November to help raise money. Abby added: HRT is no good for people like me and thataposs why I want to fundraise for this laser. But the good thing is the awareness is getting out there and theyaposre talking about it now.

The scans show the shocking impact Covid has on peopleaposs internal organs with doctors saying unvaccinated people are the ones getting really sick. Dr Sam Durrani, the chief of staff at Deer Valley Medical Center, said: The only people that are really getting sick are people that are unvaccinated. [They] oftentimes require ventilation and oxygen, especially on some of these really profound X-rays that we are seeing. Vaccinated patients who are infected with Covid have more air flowing to their lungs, with the larger part of the lungs coloured in black on the scans, Dr Durrani explained. This means there is very little or no damage to the lungs. The image of a scan from an unvaccinated person shows that the lungs are very congested, limiting the oxygen flow throughout the entire body. Dr Durrani said: If you have a vaccinated patient that comes to the ER with a breakthrough infection, that maybe have some shortness of breath and we do a CT scan, they’re not nearly as bad as the unvaccinated patients. Even the breakthrough infections that end up getting pneumonia, their CT scans still were not as bad as the ones of unvaccinated patients. Vaccines have been successful in preventing severe illness and death in most people who catch Covid, but it will not work for some. Some double-jabbed people will still end up in hospital with Covid but with a much lower level of congested lungs compared to those without any vaccine protection. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionshows that risk of dying from Covid is  times higher for unvaccinated adults than those who have been inoculated. In England, just one per cent of all Covid deaths are in those who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccine is working extremely well and is keeping the virus from progressing to pneumonia or infiltrating the lungs, Dr Durrani said. When you get a dose you can get a little sick, but eventually your body recognises it, it attacks it and you don’t get hospitalised, you don’t get put on a ventilator, it’s very profoundly effective.

She used the creams during the transition from warmer to cooler months, as her skin would flare up, but never found her condition unmanageable. But, at , after two pregnancies which appeared to cause more flare ups in her skin, the eczema began appearing in new areas, including her upper lip and arms so she used the cream more frequently. She found that the treatment was becoming less effective, and researched online to find a reason. Then she read about topical steroid withdrawal– severe symptoms experienced by long-term users of steroid creams after they stop use. While other people had documented horric reactions, including red, cracked and itchy skin, Lyndsie didn’t believe she was suffering from it until she decided to quit using the creams in September  to test the theory. “All hell broke loose,” Lyndsie, who is mum to Angel, seven, Justice Jr, five, Aria, three, and Lennox, two, told Jam Press. “The first month after stopping, my face and eyes started swelling so badly. “My rashes started to spread even more, and towards the end of the month my skin was burning and itching so badly that I couldn’t even shower or soak in the tub – my skin couldn’t tolerate water at all. “It felt like acid was being thrown on my skin when I was taking a bath – the itch was intolerable. “By month two, about  per cent of my body was covered in this burning, and non-stop itching rash that continued to worsen. “Between December  and January , my body started to ooze liquid that smelt like old pennies. “I absolutely hated my appearance – I felt like I had lost myself. “During the oozing stage, my oldest daughter would pray at night that I wouldn’t have bad skin anymore so I could hug her without it hurting. “I couldn’t take care of my kids, let alone myself, and so I felt I had lost a part of me.” The oozing even caused the skin around her ears to crust over. It had stopped by February  but she was still fully covered in the “red, itchy and burning” rash. When she visited her dermatologist, Lyndsie claims she was told she would never heal without medical intervention. While Lyndsie was in severe discomfort, she decided to persevere without going back to the steroid creams, believing them to have caused the adverse reaction. Throughout her journey, her husband, Justice, reassured her she was beautul and took over the childcare while she recovered. Lyndsie said: “He made time to believe in me and keep me motivated and in a positive mind frame. He never let me sink into depression nor gave up on me – for that I will forever be grateful for him.” Between March and September , her skin finally started to slowly heal, and by January  the majority of her body had healed. Lyndsie said: “Seeing my skin now makes me feel like a butterfly. I went through hell to be able to transform myself – not just on the outside, but on the inside as well.” Despite all she has been through, Lyndsie doesn’t regret choosing to come off of the creams – not least because her knowledge of TSW has helped her make dferent medical decisions when it comes to her children. She said: “My youngest daughter was diagnosed with eczema following taking an antibiotic for an ear infection which resulted in a rash all over her body, when I was about six months into my journey. “SoI had not went through this I would have used steroid creams on her because that would have been all I knew. Instead I focused on her diet, I used all natural remedies to help her skin heal. “She’s now eczema free – which I also don’t believe she had eczema to begin with, I believe she had an allergic reaction to the medicine. “This journey transformed me to a more positive person all together. I will never take for granted the little things, like just being comfortable with a shirt against my skin.” Her skin is currently totally healed, and the only flare ups she has now are “tiny” and “normally hormonal”. Lyndsie added: “I am now able to live a normal, comfortable le. “Going through topical steroid withdrawal, I felt I was robbed from so many things – but I refuse to look at this experience negatively. “It’s been a blessing in disguise. I was never a huge positive thinker [before], but I’ve been able to stay positive the majority of this time. “The most meaningful thing to me is that my children got to see me overcome this and I hope when they are older it will be an example of inner strength. “Overcoming this has made me feel invincible, like I can take on anything the universe throws my way.” Comment MORE ON SteroidsMedicineEczema\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one show you might not have expected to hear a complex conspiracy theory about is popular kids programme Ed, Edd n Eddy, which ran from  to  on Cartoon Network. The show was a massive hit with children at the turn of the millennium, as shown by a longevity not matched by many programmes made for kids. But new leand a completely dferent perspective has been given to the show thanks to this popular fan theory found on Reddit. The post goes into a fair bit of detail when it comes to the show, with the overarching theme being that all of the children featured on the programme are actually dead. The theory states that everyone featured in the show has died and that the cul-de-sac in which the children live is actually meant to be purgatory. According to the post, each character represents a dead child from a period in American history, ranging from the early s right up to the year . Of the title characters, supposedly Eddy was a s con artist who tried to make a quick buck but died by drowning after running away from kids who he owed money to. Siblings Ed and Sarah are said to be typical s children, with Ed being something of a recluse, obsessed with monster movies and sci-fi and they apparently perished in a car crash. Finally, Edd was supposed to be the son of middle class s parents, who had no time for their son who was killed in a science experiment gone wrong, apparently leaving him scalped, hence the hat he never takes off in the show. The full theory goes into slightly more detail about some of the other supporting characters, as well as offering some evidence in the form of the children’s strange skin tones and oddly-coloured tongues.The original post can be found on Reddit here, so go and take a read for yourselfyou want to ruin some childhood memories.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON RedditCartoon NetworkCar crashesFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Whatever youaposre doing in there - in the shower, bath or on the toilet, itaposs not for public consumption. One mum was left rather red-faced after asking her husband to aposshower in front of the bathroom window while she stood outside, after becoming suspicious that the frosted window may not censor enough. And she was right - their neighbourhood was seeing a lot more than theyaposd bargained for.Mum Jill Santom shared a video of her husband fake showering on TikTok, where it left people in stitches. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter hereShe explained: I felt like people could see me even though itaposs frosted glass. So I asked my husband to pretend heaposs showering so I could see. The hilarious video, filmed outside her home, in Tennessee, at night left people in hysterics - as her husband took his role very seriously. The footage shows a clear silhouette of him standing by the window as he commits to his role and pretends to scrub himself.The mum posted another video, showing what people could see in the day -and it was even worse, as you could clearly see her daughter standing clothed by the window. One person joked: Put up a large image of Jesus. So that anyone who dares to look can feel judged. Another wrote: OMG I have the same window and on a golf course. Iaposm now horried! A third added: That window has got to go. One viewer quipped: Hope the neighbours will pay well for the show. And this is why windows in showers are NEVER a good idea, wrote another.

However, while itaposs normal for parents face challenges, one man has opened up about how he finds it completely impossible to be a good parent, because his girlfriend wonapost let him do so. The man and his partner got together  years ago but have never gotten married due to his girlfriendaposs commitment issues. Six years ago, his partner decided she wanted a baby, but instead of having a child together, the woman opted to get pregnant via a sperm donor so the child would legally be hersthey were ever to split up. While the child is biologically and legally hers alone, Iaposve been raising the child together since day one. We both work full time and split the expenses but I do the lionaposs share of chores,it matters, the man explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. Problem is, as the child grows, she becomes increasingly protective. By protective, I mean she doesnapost let me use common parenting methods, like natural consequences and setting boundaries. Every thing I try to do, she undermines or undoes it.  He continued: This is NOT what we had agreed upon before having the child. We took parenting classes, read books and attended workshops. Now it seems she has thrown all that out the window. Our child can do whatever she wants, eat only jellybeans for breakfastso she fancies, stay up past midnightshe still wants to play. Of course that is not healthy. Most recently, the child - who is about to turn six - aposdoodledapos all over the manaposs laptop, and his girlfriend wouldnapost even let him sit her down to explain why it was wrong. In short, she doesnapost say no, doesnapost teach child right from wrong, and doesnapost let me do it. The kindergarten teachers have already complained a ton about behaviour issues and suggest that we have our child evaluated, which we did, he continued. The specialist gave us some insightful advice that my girlfriend chose to ignore because she believes her child is perfect, and she is actively preventing me from carrying out those advice, such as setting a schedule, limit sugary foods etc. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The man says heaposs tried to sit his partner down to discuss the issue more times than he cares to count, but she doesnapost see an issue, and has even dismissed his ideas of family therapy. Instead, the girlfriend has told him heaposs the only one with a problem, which has been internalised by their child, who thinks heaposs the bad guy. I wanted to try harder because I really love the child evensheaposs not mine biologically, but today I overheard my girlfriend tell her that I aposstill need to earn the parent titleapos and I broke, the man continued. I pulled her aside and told her I can never be the childaposs parent because she wonapost let me. Now sheaposs mad, accusing me of trying to abandon our child and giving me the cold shoulder. The man then confessed he felt guilty because while the little girl wasnapost around to hear the argument, he fears she will pick up on it because sheaposs a smart kid. Iaposm so sorry but itaposs not going to get better, itaposs only going to get worse. Cut your losses and leave, one Reddit user commented. I know you love the kid like your own, but your partner is already alienating her from you and youaposre still right there. Leave while you still have youth and heart to start over. Another added: She doesn’t want to be a committed partner or a co-parent with you. She doesn’t want you to parent her child . Just leave and find someone who will actually let you into their le.

Over  British Afghans are believed to be stranded in the country following the abrupt withdrawal of Allied troops in August. Many were caught up in chaos at Kabul airport as people stampeded to catch the last flights out. Behind the camera is a Bradford dad-of-three who tonight told of families surviving on scraps of food in abandoned buildings. They hide as the Taliban go door to door hunting those with British links.  The -year-old businessman, whose children are aged seven to , said: “It’s starting to get cold. We have no cooking facilities so are living on cheese, bread and biscuits.” He said he and his we are forced to send the children out to buy food or risk being killed on sight.  He added: “We are utterly desperate now. Only a handful of people have been offered flights from the Government, but it is not offering to airlt our families. “I look into the eyes of my children, who ask every day when the Prime Minister will save them.” He regularly flew to Afghanistan for business and met his we there. He was in the process of bringing her to the UK when he became stranded.  In the heartbreaking film, he tells how many of those trapped, including engineers, medics and builders, were holding on to the dim hope of rescue. He said: “We met to record this message in the hope than someone out there will hear our voice and take action. It looks like the UK has... abandoned us.” The Foreign Office said: “We will continue to do all we can to secure safe passage to enable British nationals and eligible Afghans to leave the country.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Boris JohnsonTalibanForeign OfficePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nataly Galdino, , from São Vicente, Brazil, had to go to hospital and spent two days looking like she had had fillers because of the arthropod. I was sleeping and, in the middle of the night, I felt something prick my upper lip and I saw that it was stuck to my blanket and the claw in my mouth, but as it was dark all I did was pull, she said. I pulled and didnapost want to let go. I tried for five seconds, with unbearable pain and it wouldnapost come unstuck. I got out of bed, turned on the light, saw my cut mouth and the giant centipede on the deck. Although centipede venom can typically cause swelling and some pain it isnapost usually dangerous to humans, but Natalie was concerned because of the location of the bite around her mouth. As she was also suffering from shortness of breath, she decided to get medical attention after the bite on  October. She said: My mouth immediately started to swell and I ran to the hospital, there they medicated me with medicine for pain and allergy.  I ed home and it took two days to deflate. She said the experience was nerve-racking as she didnapost know much about centipedes, whether the venom was poisonous orshe would die.Now fully recovered, Natalie shared the story with her followers on her Instagram stories and warned them the creatures like humidity, so itaposs important to look out for them around your home.Comment MORE ON Angelina JolieHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

inspired Stephen Collie to start operating his own ice cream bike, which has been a well-loved feature of locals and tourists alike visiting Aberdeen beach over the years.Stephen launched Nostalgic Ice Cream Bike in September  and has been serving traditional dairy ice cream to dessert lovers at the city#s beachfront most weekends ever since.During the weekdays the -year-old, from Aberdeen, is a driver for a local transport company.But it is his weekend venture, which opens from around am or noon to pmon Saturdays and Sundays, that gives Stephen #a lot of satisfaction and pride.#Being an outdoor business, Nostalgic Ice Cream Bike is only open seasonally from March until the end of October.However, Stephen also offers bookings for other events all year round, including weddings, galas, fairs and fundraisers.The bike is based on the old-fashioned Walls ice cream tricycle that was introduced in , which made its way around housing estates across London serving ice cream to locals.#Many of my older customers say the bike brings back memories of their childhood,# Stephen said.#I love hearing their stories.#The idea came from a love of the seaside and enjoying the open air. I used to live in a flat near the beach as a child and my grandparents took me there a lot while my parents were working.#My grandfather was a crane driver at Aberdeen harbour most of his working le until he retired so I#ve always enjoyed watching boats going in and out.#I also found there were many ice cream bikes in the south of England, but none in Aberdeen.#Stephen had wanted to launch his own business for some time, but finally plucked up the courage to start looking into the idea in the winter of .After making contact with the council and environmental health at the start of , and securing relevant licenses and compliance, Nostalgic Ice Cream Bike came into play in September that year.He continued: #I started my own business as a means to get a bit more cash to support my family. The bike has proved to be a welcome attraction in the city so I haven’t really looked back.#Covid took its toll and we lost over  bookings overnight with lockdown, but by serving at the beach it kept us going.#Buying the bike and necessary trailer and equipment plus initial stock was an investment of more than £,.Placing an order in March  for the equipment he was up and running by the autumn.#The bike was hand-built by Lee Hayes of Peddlers Ice Cream near Southampton, while I made the cart using an old bicycle trailer. I made a wood trim to offer more flavours of ice cream,# said Stephen.#The bike has its own modern power system where the freezer can be run on battery power.#It#s great being at the beach watching surfers and swimmers and families enjoying themselves. You also get to spot a dolphin or two, it#s a great way to pass the day.#Stephen serves up ice cream produced by Cream o# Galloway, based at Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, however he hopes to be able to make and sell his own one day.He said: #We don’t make our own ice cream at present but it’s something we would love to expand into doing.#Cream o# Galloway#s ice cream is made traditionally on a family farm using organic milk from their dairy herd and egg yolks, sugar and natural flavourings.#My partners# family comes from Castle Douglas. On a visit to see them, we went to the Cream o# Galloway visitor centre, sampled the ice cream and fell in love with the flavours. I knew then it was what I wanted to serve.#For other products like cones, sauces, etc., we use Rizza#s of Huntly.##It gives me a lot of satisfaction and pride to know I’ve launched a well-respected business which the community and wider public support.#Visit Nostalgic Ice Cream Bike on Facebook for more

win against Hibernian.The Dons lost Jack Mackenzie to injury before the game and both Calvin Ramsay and Declan Gallagher were forced off with injuries in the first half of the game at Pittodrie.The loss of the players meant the Dons had to revert to a back three for the second half with team captain Scott Brown deployed as sweeper in the victory.Glass said: “We had to reshape things and boys weren’t playing in natural positions.“In the second half we didn’t have as much possession as we would have liked so we changed the shape a little bit to get more pressure on them.“There were crosses and shots from distance but we didn’t give up a lot of opportunities for them to score.“If we had made the mistakes we had previously, maybe I would be sitting here saying the same things.”With Mackenzie set to see a specialist on Monday to assess the extent of his ankle injury suffered in training on Thursday the Aberdeen manager is fearing the worst.Glass also believes it is unlikely Ramsay and Gallagher will be available for Wednesday’s trip to Ibrox to face Premiership champions Rangers.He said: “I don’t know but I would guess Wednesday would be too quick as two fo them came off.“But I hope that I am wrong.“Jack Mackenzie will be assessed on Monday but it looked like a bad one on Thursday at training.“Sometimes when you are under the cosh things get thrown at you and you have to deal with it.“The players showed they are a group that can play multiple positions which helps.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/07/WMX_170721_01-18_39718836-e1627574452336-618x372.jpg ","title":"peterhead boss jim mcinally talks up brett long after falkirk heroics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAny polls taken on the player of the season so far at Peterhead are likely to include goalkeeper Brett Long right near the top.Time and again this season the Blue Toon have been able to count on the in-form stopper, none more so than Saturday when a string of top saves kept Falkirk at bay.The goal-less draw was preserved chiefly by Long, who denied Declan McDaid, Aidan Nesbitt and Michael Ruth from breaching the Peterhead defence.Since his arrival from East Fe in the summer he has won the battle of the Balmoor goalkeepers, keeping good friend Lenny Wilson on the bench for now.#He#s doing really well # his shot-stopping particular is really good,# said manager Jim McInally. #We#re encouraging to be braver with crosses.#He#s been good and he#s built up a rapport with Lenny . They push each other and even Lenny said to me he doesn#t blame me for picking Brett.#It was not a game which will be remembered for expansive, free-flowing football, owing mainly to the high winds in the north-east, but Peterhead were able to hold their own.Two first-half injuries saw Simon Ferry and Niah Payne replaced, while midfielder Andy McCarthy was removed early in the second half to avoid picking up a second booking. #BlueToon 🔵⚪️💙mdash Peterhead FCOctober , McInally added: #We ended up with a team on the park that was a team of young boys. It was pretty bizarre to be honest.#Grantcame in on in the first half, Lyallhadn#t played for a while and they weren#t where they could be legs-wise. I had to take Andy McCarthy off before he got sent off and with things going wrong, I thought we dealt with it.#We#d been working on dferent shapes and you could tell  minutes into the second half, it was a day for closing ranks a wee bit.#McInally was able to count on another influential performance from teenager Josh Mulligan.The Dundee loanee has made himself an indispensable part of the Peterhead side since ing for a second loan spell at the League One club this season.He has featured mainly at right-back but has also been called upon at centre-half and in midfield, with Mulligan finishing Saturday#s game as a right winger.If he continues on his current form, then once heto Dens Park in the summer he should be in a great position to push on for a first-team place.McInally said: #Considering it wasn#t a game where everything went in his favour today # defensively he#s learning andhe can crack that, he#s going to be some player.#I#m pretty sure he#ll be knocking on the door when he goes back. I think he#s a modern-day right-backhe was a full-back for Celtic or Rangers he would just bomb on every time but at Dundee it#s a bit tougher and you might get exposed defensively.#He#s got such an engine in him and has great pace and strength. If he learns how to be a better defender there#ll be no stopping him.#Peterhead lost Ferry after just  minutes, which required an immediate re-shuffle with winger Grant Savoury coming on.Payne got injured shortly after but was able to continue until half-time, after a nasty-looking roll of his ankle in his own penalty area.McInally said: #Simon#s hamstring tightened up, so we#re hoping that#ll be OK. Niah#s was a horrible-looking one at the time, because a massive mound of turf came up. It looks like he#s damaged the ligaments in his ankle.#"},{"url":null,"title":"star return to league action with victory","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.RJD-sponsored Red Star travelled to Ballerup, East Kilbride on Saturday October  to play their first league game since February  and ed home with three points after an excellent overall performance.The visitors started the game on the front foot and could have been ahead after three minutes when Fraser Talbot#s long range effort came crashing back off the bar.Star didn#t have long to wait before they opened the scoring, however, as Stuart MacLean reacted quickest to a slip in the Duncanrig defence to put his side ahead four minutes later.Talbot again came close to his first Red Star goal but was denied by the crossbar for the second time after finding space to shoot in the box.The lead was doubled soon after when Aaron Moore linked up well with Stuart MacLean on the right channel and powered his shot through the hands of the Duncanrig keeper.Star had several chances to make the game safe in the opening half hour with Craig Aitken and Andy Weir providing the ammunition from the wide areas but the final touch was slightly lacking.Coll McCallum was next to rattle the bar as his long-range effort took a bizzare bounce over the keeper#s head but the woodwork was once again kind to the hosts.Duncanrig pulled themselves back into the game with a rare attack which saw Star switch off and concede a disappointing goal as the midfielder was able to burst through the Star spine unchallenged to leave Ally Lewis with no chance.This stung Star back into action and the two-goal cushion was restored before the break when an excellent counter-attack saw Talbot lay a perfectly weighted pass into the path of Aitken, who finished with great composure to give Star a - lead at half time.Star looked to put the game to bed as quickly as possible in the second half and did so as Aaron Moore grabbed his second of the afternoon following a slip from the Duncanrig keeper.MacLean was next to double his tally as he proved too sharp for the Duncanrig defence and finished well from a tight angle to make the score - with half an hour to go.This gave manager Weir the chance to ring the changes, with Ryan Caskie coming on to replace Aaron Moore and helping himself to two goals of his own from close range to make the final score -.The only sour note was an injury to goal-scoring substitute Caskie which will rule him out of Star#s next game.Star look to make it back-to-back wins on Saturday October , again on their travels to Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll teachers to speak at local climate summit","story":" Updated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council will host its first education climate summit next week with local teachers playing a pivotal role in the event.On October  and  speakers from schools, businesses and charities will address the online event to raise awareness of a broad range of climate issues.Taynuilt teacher Jenner Love will tell those attending about how her pupils have been working with a local textile company to create natural, powerful messages to raise awareness of climate change.Taynuilt Primary School pupils worked with textile company Crubag as part of a project documenting research they had carried out into plastics on their shorelines.

lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

The weather’s thrown us the odd curve ball, but this is the Western Isles in October, we’re ready for that.#Missing last year was pretty tough to take for us, the crews and the spectators, but we’ve come back with an absolutely superb rally.

If they cannot, we are confident that the service will run in , but we will not be able to offer a service next year,# said Mr Abernethy.He added that both state-owned ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, which had been barred from running the route by the government, and Sea Containers had looked at the route and were convinced it was profitable.The enterprise company has been standing by ready to invest more than £ million in the Campbeltown Harbour redevelopment, with a further £. million attracted through the European Objective One programme.The project, seen as one of the most important for the whole of Argyll for decades, will involve the construction of a terminal, a roll-on roll-off linkspan and berthing facilities, access roads and car parking.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe town clerk received a letter from the Ministry of Defence asking the councilthe refuse dump at the Aros Moss could be closed down as soon as possible, because of the danger to aircraft from the large number of gulls.After discussion it was agreed to ask the Ministry of Defenceit would be willing to contribute something towards the cost of a machine for disposing of the refuse.Treasurer Hulbert suggested that the gulls be killed and, after the town clerk reminded him that some species of gulls were protected by law, Mr Hulbert said: #Black-backed gulls are regarded as winged vermin and therefore can be shot.#He added: #This would be a lot cheaper.#[Editor#s note: This was lawful  years ago it is not today. In the words of the RSPB: #All species of gull are protected under the Wildle and Countryside Act  and the WildleOrder . This makes it illegal to intentionally or, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is also illegal to prevent birds from accessing their nests and, in Northern Ireland, it is illegal to disturb any nesting bird. In addition, the Mediterranean gull is protected under Schedule  of both acts. This makes it illegal to intentionally or recklessly disturb the birds at or close to their nest or to disturb their dependent young. However, the law recognises that in certain circumstances control measures may be necessary. Simple nuisance or minor damage to property are not legally sanctioned reasons to kill gulls.#]ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Glasgow News says that there is now confirmation of the statement made recently that among the constituencies to be contested by the Independent Liberals at the next election is Argyll.This stronghold of Sir William Sutherland is to be attacked by that soldier-journalist-author, Captain R W Campbell, whose Spud Tamson, a wartime sketch, gained him some notoriety five years ago.

The superb fluttering of light was of startling beauty and dazzling splendour, momentarily illuminating the sky from horizon to horizon.Accompanied by this brilliant display of lightscape were sharp cracks and outbursts of thunder, which rumbled, reverberated and re-echoed throughout the landscape with an eerie sort of foreboding effect.The phenomenon was characterised by a high percentage of fork lightning, which is most unusual in our temperate zone."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 15","story":"It was encouraging to see a positive and constructive debate, with cross-party MSPs from across the region delivering a similar message.What matters now is what happens next.John Gurr, chairman of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, has invited Transport Minister Graeme Dey and the area#s MSPs to join him in a journey along the route, #on the bus too,#desired.Whatever mode of transport Mr Dey choses to take one thing remains certain.

It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio.

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

Formed in , the band has more than three decades and nine previous albums under their belt before their latest, Irsquove Been Trying to Tell You. And they know better than most that when it comes to time, memory and nostalgia, pop music is a currency for all three.Itrsquos a Friday afternoon and Saint Etienne are not in the building. We are speaking via Zoom. I am in Falkirk, Bob Stanley is in Bradford and Pete Wiggs is in Hove. Sarah Cracknell, meanwhile, is somewhere in Oxfordshire where she is busy putting her son in touch with a  Volkswagen Jetta in Chelmsford.The past is everywhere around us today. A Volkswagen Jetta is the first car I ever drove I tell Cracknell when she finally joins us. And Saint Etiennersquos second album So Tough was the first CD I ever bought.Wersquore together to talk about the bandrsquos past and present and their new album which is itself a shimmering vision of the some of our yesterdays. Irsquove Been Trying to Tell You may be the ultimate example of the bandrsquos bespoke, hand-crafted take on bricolage.Ask for a mission statement for the album and Stanley offers something that perfectly ties in with todayrsquos theme. ldquoItrsquos about trying to retrieve memory in a nutshell and how you canrsquot. Your memory will be unreliable and the way you remember something is inevitably compromised by passing time.Pete Wiggs and Bob StanleyAnd how is this achieved on the album, you might ask  By sampling albums from a period at the end of the s and the start of the new century, slowing them down and then creating these immersive, beautul atmospheres out of them.I mean, guys, I ask Wiggs and Stanley, are they even songs  ldquoKind of, Wiggs suggests. ldquoWhen Irsquom explaining it to relatives, I say itrsquos a bit less songy, a bit more experimental. But I still think of them as songs, especially the ones with vocals.ldquoAnd they do have structure itrsquos just not traditional structure, I suppose.The back story, Stanley explains, is that theyrsquove been listening to a lot of stuff that gets labelled ldquoliminal and ldquochill wave.ldquoItrsquos been brewing for a good  years or so, I think, but it has mutated into this thing where people put stuff up on YouTube an abandoned soft play area with a slowed down Alexander OrsquoNeal song over the top or whatever, because itrsquos this weird thing of trying to recapture childhood.ldquoWe thought, lsquohow about doing that with a specic period of British history rsquoldquoSo, we picked on - , the last time there was a general sense of optimism. People werenrsquot blindly thinking the futurersquos going to be great, but there were some grounds for maybe thinking things will be better in the future.Read More: Nicky Wire on the retun of Manic Street PreachersRead More: Tim Burgess on  years of The CharlatansAnd so, they began to listen to albums from that period, but not the cult indie ones you might expect.ldquoWe wanted the samples to be by mainstream acts, Stanley explains, ldquorather than some obscure -inch that only came out in Colombia.As a result, the likes of Samantha Mumba and the Lighthouse Family have now all been absorbed into Saint Etiennersquos soundscape.ldquoWe sampled a Natalie Imbruglia song, Stanley points out, ldquobut we werenrsquot going to sample Torn because it would have been too obvious. It would just have been a weird remix, I suppose.The samples provide thefoundation to buildsomething new and distinctive on, eight tracks that sound like what you might imagine is the sound of music dreaming.Initially the band werenrsquot sure it would even be an album. They assumed it might be something for their fan club. But these strange and strangely gorgeous sort-of-songs deserved a wider audience.Sarah Cracknell. Photograph Elaine ConstantineCracknell has now joined us, just in time for me to ask about her vocals, which, here, are just another texture in the music. Did that feel very dferent than the previous records ldquoA little bit dferent. Not that much. Irsquove always been into the idea of the vocals not necessarily having a narrative and being quite atmospheric. Itrsquos always something Irsquove listened to with other singers, other music, and Irsquove done a bit of it in the past, so it wasnrsquot completely unnatural.ldquoIn fact, it was good fun. I felt very free doing it. She pauses, thinks of what she has just said. ldquoSounds a bit hippy.The story of Saint Etienne has always been, for me, a London story. So often they hymn the love and poison of the capital as much as Suede, albeit in a very dferent register. But now Stanley, Wiggs and Cracknell have moved out of the city.ldquoWe had our moment of proper London which you feel very fortunate for, Wiggs suggests, ldquobut it gets to a point where you think, lsquoIrsquove had enough fun.rsquoldquoToo much fun, laughs Cracknell.Their London may have been taking place in the same city as Britpop, but possibly not in the same postcode. They allied themselves more to the cityrsquos dance culture, excited by the emergence of jungle, drum rsquon rsquobass and UK Garage. They certainly werenrsquot keen on waving the Union flag. ldquoWersquore not particularly nationalistic, Stanley points out.ldquoWersquore certainly not London uber alles type people, Wiggs adds. ldquoIt just happened to be where we lived near that was better than where we grew up. If we were in Scotland, Irsquom sure we would have ended up in Glasgow, which is a great city.He has to say that being married to a Glaswegian, of course.Saint Etienne now have a back story stretching back more than  years. They have their own history, but they are not defined by it.ldquoI think wersquore lucky that we never had one record that completely overshadows everything , Stanley suggests. ldquoWe never did Ebeneezer Goode.ldquoWe did, we just got away with it, Wiggs counters. ldquoThe Fred EP.Oh yes, they were one of a number of bands on the Heavenly record label who covered s pop sensations and more recently anti-vaxxers Right Said Fred in .ldquoDubious people we have collaborated with, says Stanley, laughing.The question I have, I say, is how do you play this new album live  ldquoExactly, Wiggs says. ldquoThis is the conversation that needs to be had before we do the gigs in November.The weird thing about Saint Etienne is they made perfect sense in the s and they make perfect sense now. The ultimate pop archivists, they are a pick-n-mix band who now findthemselves in an era when music is itself a big pick-n-mix counter.ldquoEverythingrsquos in the present. Itrsquos weird, ldquo Stanley agrees.ldquoIt is funny, Wiggs chips in. ldquoWhen we were teenagers, they werenrsquot playing loads of s music on the radio.

I said All right, its in my wheelhouse, so Ill give it another shot - and so thats what Ive done again.\"The six-part comedy-drama, which Merchant co-created with American writer and producer Elgin James, and also directed, follows a group of misfits renovating a derelict community centre in Bristol, as part of community service for ious crimes they have committed.The seven strangers working together are lawyer Greg , teenager Rani , who is meant to be off to Oxford University, socialite Gabby , young doorman Christian , right-wing businessman John , radical activist Myrna , and conman Frank, played by none other than Hollywood star Christopher Walken.The inspiration for The Outlaws came from Merchants parents, who worked for Bristol Community Service.\"They used to tell me about the sort of people who came through the ranks - some of whom I went to school with, it turned out,\" notes the funnyman, who is also known for co-writing The Office and Extras, alongside Ricky Gervais.\"When we started thinking about the show it was during Trump, and it was Brexit, and the country felt very ided and everyone felt like they were in their bubbles.\"I just thought it was interesting - could you take all these types of people that everyone now is being labelled - Youre left wing, Youre right wing, or whatever it might be - and put them together and see how they interact \"Will their sympathies grow for each othertheyre working together  That was the jumping-off point.\"As for the themes in the show , Merchant says: \"Ive never done anything to try and be provocative. I know that seems unlikely, because Ive done controversial stuff, or stuff which feels edgy, but thats never really my agenda.\"Im not trying to prod anybody in particular, I just thought it was interesting to have all these people from dferent walks of le, all of whom are going to have dferent opinions and dferent views, and see them rub up against each other, really - and therefore people can be corrected or challenged, or they can question their beliefs.\"But also, sometimes people who have the wrong opinions can still be funny.\"He continues: \"You might find a character offensive, but you could perhaps still understand where theyre coming from or perhaps see what led them to that place.\"But I did it in collaboration with the writers room and also involved the cast, in terms of asking questions.\"Im still trying to educate myself - I cant write from the perspective of a young Asian woman or whatever, so its important to not only have a ied writing room but also involve the cast as well and ask them, How would they speak and How do you feel about those things \"As the episodes progress, dramatic events see the characters in danger, after finding themselves in the middle of a criminal turf war.The plan was always to make The Outlaws a \"low-level thriller\", elaborates Merchant.\"I find it odd when they dont have any humour and theyre a bit po-faced and a bit over-earnest and everythings just depressing.\"So I wanted it to be that you could still enjoy it, have some crime elements and some politics with a small p, and some social stuff.\"We tried to make sure that nothing got silly or that the villains were comic so they didnt seem threatening any more.\"Ive never been in a criminal situation, but Elgin, who I created the show with, has - he was in gangs growing up and went to prison later in le.\"He would tell me these stories that were dark and tragic but also funny.\"The thriller aspect of the series meant the cast got to try their hand at action sequences, which Merchant absolutely loved.\"Ive always wanted to make an action movie, and no-one comes to me and thinks, This is the guy for an action movie.\"I did a bit of stunt driving and I love that stuff, its really good fun and its something dferent.\"A lot of local talent was used in front of and behind the camera, which Merchant is clearly proud of.And what really comes across watching The Outlaws is how Bristol feels like a character in itself - its such a visual city, full of graffiti and hills, and the setting adds to the story too.\"I like the idea of making somewhere specic in a show. The idea The Office was in Slough - it might seem like thats too specic, but it turns out I think the more specic you are, the more universal it becomes. Because people think, Ive never been there, but I sort of relate.\"Unfortunately, as the show was made during Covid-, the cast could not socialise and enjoy the city together - which was especially a shame considering Merchant had Walken travel from the US for the role.\"I promised him Come to Bristol, its a great city, there are great restaurants so we can take you out to dinner - and of course we couldnt do any of it because we filmed it through lockdown,\" recalls Merchant.\"Hes like , so I was just terried the whole time - I dont want him to catch Covid on my watch. Any time anyone even looked like they were going to sneeze, I would jump in front of him like a guy taking a bullet for the president.\"As for what is next for Merchant, we could well see more of The Outlaws on our screens.\"I like the idea thatit carried on, it would be dferent groups of offenders at dferent times,\" he muses.\"It would be like Doctor Who - the same basic idea, but dferent people over years and years. That seems quite fun.\"People could always be international. It turns out, having done some research, that community service is very similar all over the world. Community service in Berlin or Delhi - it would be amazing.\"The Outlaws starts on BBC One tomorrow at pm"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26-glasgows-lord-provost-welcomes-chance-history-summit","story":"And for Glasgow it is a city which is on the verge of history as it could be the destination where a game-changing world climate agreement could be reached.A Glasgow Agreement could be the result of the UN climate summit, which is being hailed as the last best hope to tackle climate change.In what is the biggest policing and security operation the country has ever staged ndash even greater than the G summit in Gleneagles in  ndash there are already signs in the city of the scale of the summit and the impact hosting it will have. Close to the SEC campus, where it is being held, a ring of steel has already been thrown up as preparations are scaled up.However, while there are warnings that its citizens may face disruption during the -day event through travel restrictions, strikes by rail and cleansing workers and potential demonstration issues, itrsquos first citizen, Lord Provost Philip Braat, believes this is a time when the city is on the cusp of being part of history.Read more: Glasgow art schools Mackintosh building to be faithfully reinstated after devastating fireldquoIt is exciting that the eyes of the world will be on Glasgow and itrsquos that Glasgow is probably the most talked-about city on the planet right now ndash and quite rightly so, the Lord Provost said.ldquoIt is great that Glasgow has been chosen as the host city for this historic event. Over the last few decades, Glasgow has built up this reputation as a centre for excellence and, with its expertise and knowhow, for being able to host some of the biggest exhibitions and conferences and sporting events. We just have to think back to the Commonwealth Games in  and to the Euros, more recently, so I think that hosting COP is a worthy reflection of that reputation. I am also very happy that it is here because, ultimately, after the past  months that we as city and society have gone through.Mr Braat believes there will be benefits to businesses and citizens at a much-needed time.He added: ldquoThere will be thousands of delegates and activists coming to the city and it will be a massive boon to the cityrsquos economy and in particular to the hospitality trade at a time when they need that injection of support. I think COP will deliver that.ldquoEven more importantly I think we have to realise that the summit and its outcome will benefit the world and it is of an existential importance to everyone, not just to this city, but to the whole planet. The result is absolutely critical so I am hoping that on November  to be reading headlines that we have the Glasgow Agreement. That is ultimately what we are aiming for ndash a in that positive, meaningful end result after two weeks of negotiations that will hopefully give us a signicant legacy and a signicant sustainable planet to take forward so that the next generations wonrsquot look back with shame on the current generation.As steps are made to get the city COP ready, the cityrsquos leadership has faced criticism in past weeks over its cleansing policy and claims of dirty streets and there was a backlash when Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken dismissed them, saying the city needed no more than a ldquospruce up ahead of COP.Read more: Clarkston falls silent in tribute to gas disaster victims  years onSpeaking yesterday, Ms Aitken said the council was focusing on dealing with fly-tipping ahead of the COP summit and acknowledged there are ldquohotspots where it is a particular problem.Ms Aitken said the pandemic has had a ldquosignicant impact on the cityrsquos cleansing services but she insisted the litter situation is improving.With road closures due to be in place, including part of the Clydeside Expressway from pm this evening, Mr Braat said he was very acutely aware of the possible disruption ndash not just in his role as Lord Provost, but also as the local councillor for the area where many of the meetings and side events linked to the summit are being staged.ldquoWe know there could well be other disruptions with regards to a potential rail strike, he added. ldquoEveryone has the right to withdraw their labour in situations where they are feeling aggrieved or want to seek financial alleviation, but I have to stress the point that these are part of national negotiations that Glasgow does not have any direction or influence over.ldquoThe impact and focus of any potential strike will be on Glasgow ndash and understandably so. But, from my perspective ndash and I utterly respect the unions making that decision ndash I also want to balance out with the disruption that it will cause to the citizens of Glasgow who simply want to go about their day-to-day business so I hope that all parties concerned will take that on board during any further national negotiations.ldquoThere will also be some unknown disruptions, whether it is activists who may block roads. I think they are very passionate about what they believe in and Irsquom delighted that they are taking action and that finally their voices are being heard but, ultimately, because of the signicance of COP, we donrsquot have any alternative option. We need to have COP. Whether it took place here in Glasgow or where in the world we would expect to have some disruption even for the simple matter of having an event attracting dozens of world leaders, which has an impact on security as well and it will have an impact on residents.ldquoHowever, I hope that residents will see the ultimate benefit of that. If we can say at the end of COP that we have delivered a sustainable, green world plan that secures the long term and longevity of our planet, I hope that disruption will have been worthwhile.Glasgow is a city which is no stranger to protest and marches for causes and the Lord Provost recognises itrsquos everyonersquos democratic right to have their voices heard.ldquoThere are officially sanctioned demonstrations taking place, including a youth march, and they are important because peoplersquos voices need to be heard, he added. ldquoActivists should be there ndash they are there with the passion that they want to see real change and that is absolutely right. I will hopefully be joining in with that because I want to add my voice to their voice to highlight to the world leaders that they must make the tough decisions and bold ambition to ensure that we deliver on a proper agreement.Mr Braat said the city had been preparing for COP for months during a time when it has been handling the Covid crisis.ldquoWhatever has been asked of us we have done on top of having to make sure that the citizens of Glasgow have stayed safe during the last  months, he added. ldquoAs a local councillor and resident in Glasgow, I am fully aware that the state of our communities and the streets we live in are very important to most people. If they are not clean, people will make their voices heard, but decisions relating to that are not in my gt as the civic leader of the city. There are other people who have been charged with those decisions and implementing them, but I am also aware that some of these decisions arenrsquot easy to take.ldquoI have been in that position myself with the previous administration when I was the city treasurer. You have to make sure that resources are available against competing demands from ious departments and stakeholders. Beyond that, I canrsquot interfere as that would be inappropriate for me as Lord Provost, but I want to say I really respect the work that all of the councilrsquos frontline staff ndash and that includes the cleansing staff, the social care sector, and anyone  in the council and in the wider public sectors ndash have done for the city during the past  months to get us through the worst times of the pandemic to the place we are now.ldquoI go out into communities throughout the city regularly and I listen to their concerns and I try to help as best as I can, whether that is feeding that information back to the relevant departments or rolling up my sleeves and helping out with litter-pick events. Thatrsquos what I see as a role I can inhabit ndash showing support and bringing a message of hope. I think the city is ready to host the best but also the most crucial and important COP in history.It is in not unusual for the Lord Provost to turn up in his jeans and get on with the job of helping communities, groupswhether it is handing out food packages during the pandemic or handing out bowls of soup at a charity project in the city, as he did just a few nights ago.This week, Glasgow council launched its draft Green Deal roadmap for the city, a nine-year mission to transform the cityrsquos economy in order to tackle the climate emergency.The Glasgow Green Deal objectives are to reduce emissions and therefore climate risk create sustainable jobs and quality places eliminate poverty and deliver justice through inclusion and equality.Mr Braat said the legacy of COP for the city will be building a greener, sustainable, Glasgow ndash and that companies will be chapping on the cityrsquos door to be here.He said: ldquoThe way forward for any city in the world will be in the green sector, producing clean and green technology and investing in clean and green industries. Many cities around the world will be desperate to seek inward investment from such companies, but I am convincedwe have the Glasgow Agreement the benefits we can reap from that will be immense.Coming into post in January  after his predecessor Eva Bolander stepped down following a row over personal items she had claimed for on council expenses as part of her civic duties, Mr Braat says he feels his term of office has been dominated by the pandemic.ldquoI might have had plans and ambitions that I wanted to do and it might have been slightly dferent but I like everyone  had to adapt to the role. I had the choice. Do I sit back or do I go out and make a positive dference and for me it was case of rolling up my sleeves and going out in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt on helping groups and volunteers with food deliveries. It was my chance to thank people for what they were doing. What I will remember about this term of office is being able to go out and might so many people and listen to their family stories and connect with communities across Glasgow. I thank all the community groups, volunteers, frontline and key workers from all sectors for what they have done for the city during the toughest of times.\""},{"url":null,"title":"crafty-scots-learning-nail-everything-blacksmithing-stitching-experts","story":"Before then he had been in New Zealand, putting his blacksmithrsquos talents to work creating metalwork props for the new Lord of the Rings television series.Made redundant due to the pandemic, back in the UK without a forge to work with and in the solitude of his late grandfatherrsquos old garden shed, he took a gas blow torch to a sheet of copper and hammered out a series of beguiling lsquomasksrsquo.The sequence of copper faces ndash one with a curly moustache, another with a smirking pout, a grimace and what could be a scream or, perhaps, an uproarious laugh ndash his collection of metal puppets and delicate sculptures appear at odds with the usual image of a blacksmithrsquos art.Yet according to Jack ndash who works under the name Jaxx Waygood ndash mastering metal using heat, hammers and brute force, doesnrsquot always have to involve the red-hot heat of the forge, evenall that bashing does bring a degree of pleasure.ldquoEveryone should have a go at heating up a bit of iron and hitting with a hammer, he says. ldquoTherersquos a lot of satisfaction in it.Plenty are willing to try: his next block of beginnersrsquo blacksmithing classes at The Forge community makersrsquo space in Edinburgh are sold out, with more in the pipeline.Jack, a journeyman blacksmith whose Work of Iron workshop is based in Ratho on the edge of Edinburgh, is among scores of expert craft artists whose skills are in high demand from the next generation of makers.Having found themselves plunged into insecurity by the pandemic with retail outlets for their products closed, workshops bolted down or in some cases suddenly having to park their craft to home school children, they are now battling to keep up with demand from Scots anxious to learn their craft.Next week makers from across the country will be answering the call, as Scotlandrsquos craft community comes together for the second Craft Week Scotland, a showcase for their talent and chance to pass on their skills in a series of lessons and workshops.Launched last year as a response to the challenges of the pandemic, this yearrsquos week-long craft celebration includes workshops in everything from willow weaving in Edinburgh to ceramic repair using the ancient Japanese technique of kintsugi in Glasgow.Dotted across the country will be taster sessions in enamelling and ceramics.

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Robert Leslie, THAW Orkney manager, said:#We are extremely grateful for this funding from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. We experienced high demand during the pandemic from Orkney residents with mental health issues or learning dficulties as they sought support to engage with energy efficiency programmes, energy providers, and income maximisation and debt services. It became clear, due to the volume of referrals and complexity of some of the work, that this was an area of our activity that needed to expand or we would be overwhelmed.#This contribution from the Resilient Communities Fund will add resource to this vital work at a time we expect demand to grow considerably again, with rising electricity prices and reductions in other support mechanisms that have been in place during the pandemic.

It is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers and any private providers showing misleading pricing on gov.uk are being removed.Meanwhile, the Welsh Government has announced it will mirror Englandrsquos lateral flow test policy, but the change will be implemented a week later.It said in a statement that it remains ldquoconcerned about the speed at which the UK Government is opening up overseas travel for England.It went on: ldquoWe have consistently urged the UK Government to take a precautionary approach towards reopening international travel.ldquoHowever, it is dficult for us to adopt a dferent testing regime to that required by the UK Government, as the majority of Welsh travellers enter the UK through ports and airports in England.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It was unclear when he would be released.Mr Basharat also said the agreement stipulates that the federal government will honour a previous agreement with the TLP to address diplomatic ties with France over the publication of the caricatures.Sajid Sai, a spokesman for Mr Rizvirsquos party, confirmed the ministerrsquos account and said thousands of party supporters will stay in the town of Mureedke, waiting for the release of party leaders and members who have been detained. vw,vw,px, px\"Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party on the outskirts of Lahore Pakistan Interior Minister Shaikh Rashid Ahmed told reporters that the TLPrsquos demand that the French ambassador to Pakistan be expelled over the caricatures will be taken to a parliamentary committee in the coming days.Mr Basharat, Mr Ahmed and Religious Affairs Minister Noorul Haq Qadri took part in the talks with the TLP executive council.Violent clashes erupted between security forces and the Islamists in Lahore, killing at least two police officers and injuring about a dozen others, police said.Mr Sai claimed four party supporters were killed by police fire and ldquomany others were injured.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders. Billy was accompanied by Libby Harrison from Saints and Scholars Primary School, Erika Stancuite of Mount St Catherines Primary School and Alfie Cummings who attends Armstrong Primary School. Blessings sung by the Cathedral Choir and given by the Church Leaders, then took place, before the final hymn, ‘Be Thou My Vision’."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1591282097106.jpg--covid_19_figures__thursday__october_21__2021.jpg?1591282097000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211021newscovid 19 figures thursday october 21 2021","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards. Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland farmers have said that a new trade deal struck by the UK and New Zealand could “severely undermine” the market in Northern Ireland by allowing an influx of cheaper meat to be imported.The Ulster Farmers Union added that the family farm structure here has become “vulnerable practically overnight” and certain farming sectors have been “sold-out”.The deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards.It has been suggested that the deal could reduce the size of the UK economy, but with the effects unlikely to spread evenly, it could mean that Northern Ireland – which depends highly on the agriculture industry – could be hit worst.UFU president Victor Chestnutt said: “UK farming and local food production has been completely undermined by this New Zealand trade deal.“Combined with the Australia agreement at the beginning of this year, government has granted access to a signicant increase of imported food allowing it into our market, with no guarantees about how it was produced orit meets our world leading standards.”Mr Chestnutt said that it is “extremely concerning” for the red meat, dairy and horticulture farm sectors and for the public.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Our consumers – who take pride in supporting local farmers for the work that they do producing high-quality, trustworthy, local food, looking after the environment and boosting employment in rural areas – have been sold out too,” he said.“No attempt of communication was made by government as to how they would work to protect our local food production while trying to get a trade deal with New Zealand over the line.“Farm businesses across Northern Ireland and the whole of the UK, are already enduring substantially higher input costs in comparison to those farmers on the other side of the world and are dealing with ongoing labour availability.“It seems that government are either oblivious to what farmers are dealing with or have chosen to dismiss it as they have created unfair competition within our home market which will affect the sustainability of our family farms in years to come.”The UFU president is now urging the British government to adopt similar approaches to New Zealand and Australia, which invest in strategic farming, in order to safeguard and strengthen British agri-food production.“As it stands, it is very hard to see the positives of this trade deal and other countries will be watching this development with a growing drive to secure a similar agreement,” said Mr Chestnutt. “Government must explain the rationale behind this new trade deal with New Zealand immediately, highlighting how it will benefit UK agriculture, our world leading standards and the future of local food production.”Most ReadSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureDrug dealer

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings.

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade.     “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children. In some cases, I have three to four generations from the samefamily. “My shop is just not another shop, it’s an integrationinto the local community where people come to have ahaircut,a chat, unload their worries, and I to them, and they sometimes have the occasional beer.” The award ceremony will beheld December  at the Europa Hotel in Belfast. Clare added: “I want to give a special thanks to my daughter, Chloe, for nominating me. I would never have done that myself.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Baby is learning our language and how we talkand most importantly about the characteristics of your voice – this helps baby to recognise you after birth. Amazingly, studies have even shown that your baby can recognise the pattern in your language, preferring this to one they have not heard before – baby has already begun their language learning journey. So talk to bump throughout the day and know she is listening to what you say. Wow, did you knowyou sing a particular nursery rhymes to your bump once they arrive in the world they will become more attentiveyou sing this same rhyme to them  This is because by the third trimester of your pregnancy your baby in the womb has developed a very good sense of hearing. This ‘learning to hear’ journey began in thevery early days of your pregnancy as your baby enjoys living in your auditory home – your womb. Baby can hear your heart beat, your breathing and even your snoring. As baby reaches  –  weeks they can begin to hear and by  –  weeks will begin to respond to the noises they like and don’t like. Did you know your baby’s heart rate slows in the womb on hearing their mothers voice  This suggests your voice has a calming effect. They also show more brain activity in the womb when listening to speech so don’t forget to let Dad talk too. Singing rhymes with bump every day helps him listen and learn So, enjoy this precious pregnancy time as you talk, singand touch your precious baby bump – you really are helping to develop that precious loving bond between you both and helping to give your baby the very best start.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Capita were requested to attend a meeting at Derry City  Strabane Council to explain errors made by the company that affected people being able to access benefits that they were entitled to. googletag.cmd.push The firm was hired by the Department of Communities in  to carry out Personal Independent Paymentassessments. However, an Ombudsman report last June found Capita had “unfairly rejected” the applications of many claimants in the north of Ireland. The Public Services Ombudsman, Margaret Kelly, said that “repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process” with evidence from medical professionals not being sought out and used by Capita in their assessments. Brendan Flynn of Capita addressed Derry City  Strabane District Council and apologised for the firms actions. He said: “Theres always a risk that we wont get things  per cent right all of the time.     “On the occasions where things do go wrong, we apologise, and we will continue to apologise and seek to put things right as soon as we become aware of any issue where we might have failed. We look to put in place safeguards, checks and balances and the continuous improvement processes to ensure those errors dont happen again.” However, Capitas apology cut no ice with Cllr Harkin who accused the firm of acting “callously” and called on Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey to strip them of the role of assessing benefits for people in need of them. He said: “Capitas administration of Personal Independence Paymenthas done great harm to vulnerable people seeking access to benefits.  People Before Profit demonstrating against PIP assessors Capita outside the Guildhall in Derry “The company has acted callously in its pursuit of profits. They should have no role in assessing whether or not people should be able to access any benefit. Capita isnt fit for this role. “Given Capitas atrocious record, its simply stunning that the Communities Minister decided the corporation should be rewarded with another multi-million pound contract through to . Coming into the role, axing Capita should have been number one on the list. “Its also unacceptable that the Minister refuses to implement the human rights Peoples Proposal, backed by  Councils including Derry and Strabane, to ensure dignied treatment to everyone seeking to access benefit help. “If this was a DUP Minister, Sinn Feacutein would be roasting them. Instead they tell us they have confidence in the Minister. “We are calling for Capita to hand over its profits to the Derry and Strabane hardship fund and other organisations working to mitigate the impact of poverty. “They should be ashamed to be lting profits following the devastating Public Service Ombudsman report. Companies solely interested in turning a profit shouldnt be getting their hands on extremely lucrative government contracts. “Capita needs to be booted out. The Peoples Proposal needs to be fully implemented. “We need to end the corrupt cycle of powerful corporations getting their hands on huge government contracts with the sole goal of squeezing out as much profit as possible no matter the damage caused to vulnerable people.” In response, a Capita spokesperson said: “We recognise and understand that the assessment process can be a stressful and anxious time for claimants.” “Our assessments are just one part of a wider process of evidence gathering on behalf of the Department for Communities and final PIP award decisions are made by the department. “All our assessors are qualied healthcare professionals including former NHS nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and paramedics, specially trained in assessing disability needs. The spokesperson said a sample of claimants are surveyed monthly following their PIP assessment by an independent research company. Over the last  months, more than  per cent of those surveyed have said they were satisfied or very satisfied with our service, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they were committed to improving the quality of PIP assessments and have already begun in doing so. They said: “These include the completion of PIP award reviews in-house, where sufficient evidence is available. This has reduced referrals to the PIP assessment provider by  per cent. “The department also employs health professionals who monitor the quality of assessments reports, and from August  the independent audit of cases has been brought in-house to provide a more robust oversight and scrutiny of the quality of service provided. “Where assessments are required, officials are working closely with the service provider to reduce the need for a claimant to attend for assessment. “Officials are also taking forward initiatives to enhance customer service in response to independent reviews that have recently completed, including the second independent review of PIP and a review of the management of the PIP assessment service contract by the NI Audit Office.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The Verge hasreported that the site, which is worth nearly  billion as of last year,is planning to rebrand itself with a new name next week. It is understood that the site received the information from a source with direct knowledge of the matter. googletag.cmd.push Specically, the source claimed that Facebooks Chief Executive Officer, billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, plans to talk about the name change at the companys annual Connect conference on October . However, the source added that the new name could be unveiled sooner. In addition, the source claimed that the name change will signy the companys new mission to on expand the metaverse, which is believed to itsambition to be known for more than its social media presence. Previously, Zuckerberg told the site in July,that Facebook will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company over a number of years.     In response, Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. The rebranding would position Facebooks social media app as one of many products under a parent company, which will also oversee groups like Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Many news sites, including The Irish Independent and, as well as The Verge itself, have noted that therumours come at a time when the company is facing increasing US government scrutiny over its business practices. Earlier this month, a whistleblower named Frances Haugen leaked documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated dferently by the company. Reports detailed that these leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied dferently, and in some cases not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck . Another leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders. Soon after,Facebook and its subsidiaries, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Mapillary, and Oculus, became globally unavailable for a period of six to seven hours. A separate whistleblower and former data scientist for the company, Sophie Zhang, recently testied to the British parliament that the social media site is allowing authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute daysOld  DateDf.inDaysconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular HomeDerry street sealed of by police overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed.

This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win. That game was won on the training ground.Kilcoo: S McEvoy, L Devlin, C McEvoy, C McClean, C McEvoy, E McEvoy, M Rogan, L Morgan, D McGreevy, R Doherty, C Kane, S Fettes, E Doyle, K Laverty, N Johnston.Subs: B McAneney, C McCrickard, C OrsquoRourke, C McEvoy Ireland, N OrsquoReilly, S McAneney, K Greenan, K McEvoy.Downpatrick: K Carling, C McKervey, O Boyle, O Beattie, N Loudon, A Trainor, V Scullion, K Turley, P Smyth, O Quinn, C Mulholland, K Convie, E Murphy, A Flynn, C Tumelty.Subs: M Shannon, R Trainor, A Doran, S Sloan, K McLeigh, G Scullion, N Madine, A Murphy, E McIlmurry, M Kelly, S Rice, K Trainor, M Ross..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_cd.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 24%2C 2001  ","story":"BISHOPSCOURT ndash The sale of Bishopscourt Motor Racing Circuit should be clinched later today.It has also been confirmed that the sprawling track, which was put on the market at the start of the month, will remain a race circuit.Yesterday afternoon the circuitrsquos current owners, David Beattie and John Gfin, were locked in crucial talks with potential owner, Jim OrsquoBrien from Newry, in a bid to finalise the deal.Although the going price for the circuit has not yet been confirmed it is believed the final bid may be in the region of half a million pounds.Last month the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surround its future.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal.

A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change.

Did the other church leaders not know he was going to speak in that way  If they did, why did not one of them gently contradict him with another view  Photo by Jonathan Porter   Press EyeIn no way did it celebrate Northern Ireland. It was a cross-border church service about partition. Indeed the organisers were at pains to say it was not a celebration.Fine. Butit is going to be entirely neutral about Northern Ireland, then a separate service of thanksgiving of our country should have been held this year.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It would be essential to have a royal at such a service of thanksgiving for one of the four home nations of the United Kingdom.On Thursday there was no royal presence, all the more regrettable given the snub of the service by President Michael D Higgins of Ireland, a man who has several times scolded Britain for its history.The most striking comment at the service was by the Roman Catholic Archbishop Eamon Martin, who spoke pointedly of the pain and loss in his community at partition.BBC Northern Ireland led Thursday’s TV evening news bulletins not on this much-discussed service but on a tragic story about a sex attack victim. It then introduced its report on the service by highlighting the criticism of Archbishop Martin.While I think this showed troubling editorial judgement, the BBC could argue that the archbishop’s criticism was the most notable comment of the day. After all, Archbishop Martin was not countered, even obliquely, by the other churchmen who spoke. Why not Did their communities not also suffer great pain, for example in the Troubles Given the scrutiny of this event, did they not know Archbishop Martin was going to say that  He wrote an article in the  this week that included stinging criticism of Northern Ireland’s history.Andthey did know, did not one of them think that a dferent and positive assessment of Northern Ireland should be aired in light of that very public criticism, which became BBC NI’s lead line This was by far the biggest Northern Ireland centenary event to date after a year in which there has been no major occasion to rejoice in the country that the great majority of the population here love and identy with .If it was not for the Covid restrictions of this year, the timid handling of the th birthday of Northern Ireland would be a scandal. But even given that context of limits on gatherings the approach to the centenary has been pitul. We now have big sporting events and rock concerts taking place. Yet the centenary of this wonderful country of almost two million people has been much less visible than the publicly funded annual West Belfast festival, which ended this year in another concert at which a crowd chanted IRA slogans. Today we report on the barriers that Sinn Fein has put in the way of centenary events . But they are allowed to have a veto, so we need the UK government to step up to the mark. Yet its showcase service seemed to have little direct association with Northern Ireland. It was asit was about the northern half of Ireland or maybe just about Ireland. Perhaps it was about global peace.It had lessons in Irish, prayers in Irish, other phrases in Gaelic too. Some fine Irish music. All good. But I saw little that was recognisably British at the service. If it was important to have Irish culture represented, then why not British, given that the unionist population takes such comfort from the existence of Northern Ireland  The Union flag — representing the nation which has sovereignty here by popular consent — was missing apart from Boris Johnson having it on his mask. Nor did I hear much that you might describe as distinctively Northern Irish .The Methodist president Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu referred to the slavery of St Patrick and the later slavery from Africa, saying people’s colour was used to diminish their humanity. He condemned the partition of that continent . Rev Dr Ivan Patterson talked of the need to hear the voice of NI’s dferent ethnicities and traditions. This is true. But the service did not mention our generosity to immigrants, and the new lives Northern Ireland has offered them.There were references to climate change but none to the scientists, engineers and business folk who shaped our  years as a distinct jurisdiction on this island. Or the leaders who, for the first  years of NIput it decades ahead of the  independent counties in matters from infrastructure to the welfare state to elementary rights such a orce. No references to the sports people, actors or other luminaries who have reflected our sense of ourselves as a distinct society.You might say a church service is not a rollcall of achievements. But it should at a minimum have had a specic reflection for the many people who from  gave their lives in service of Northern Ireland, a country that was expected not to survive but has lasted a century.I felt almost surprise when the Anglican Archbishop John McDowell described his working class unionist roots as “an immensely rich culture”. He was quick to add that his mother had “a strong sense of Irish identity” too.A rare moment of recognition of our country was when the Presbyterian moderator Dr David Bruce said “I love” Northern Ireland . In fact it was one of the few times I heard the words Northern Ireland uttered.If church was not the place to champion Northern Ireland, what other planned event will  The Feile crowd was estimated at ,. Where is the NI centenary event of such scale  It was bad that no royal was present. The Queen is blameless for that. Aged , Her Majesty is  years older than the retirement age of  for working women of her generation, yet her ongoing commitment to public duty is beyond doubt. It transpired that she spent Wednesday night in hospital and we all wish her well.But why was no senior royal’s diary cleared long ago for October , so they were on standby in case a monarch of such advanced years was unable to travel I consider all of the royals blameless for the absence. I have reported on most of them on visits here and do not doubt their commitment to this part of the UK. It is the government that should have made clear to the royal family the value they attached to an NI ceremony, particularly after the Higgins snub.Instead, our biggest event was a service that seemed to follow a Northern Ireland Office view of NI as a place that is neither British nor Irish, and the history of which is best left unmentioned, unless it is criticised as sectarian.See Billy Kennedy, page  of the Weekend Print edition• Billy Kennedy: Queen’s absence left a huge void at centenary service• ‘Sinn Fein determined to start culture war with unionism’: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

The Queen’s health-related absence from Thursday’s service sent nationalist commentators into hyper driveThey could send one of their members over to London armed with a pair of binoculars and a notebook to look out for ravens.Specically, they could position themselves outside the Tower of London and watch for any signs that the six resident ravens there might about to leave the famous castle on the north bank of the Thames. Because as the legend goesthe conspiracy of ravens eventually depart for good from the Tower then not only it but the entire kingdom will fall.Andthe ravens fly away the #Think  or New Ireland ‘twitchers’ will see that as somehow proof positive that the Union is now definitely doomed.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf you think that imagined scenario is a little bit outlandish then reflect not only on some of the wilder speculation on social media but even within the pages of a Sunday newspaper last weekend about the Union’s future. One writer speculated that when the Queen eventually dies the Union could be plunged into peril. While across outlets like Twitter nationalist commentators and the usual trolls went into hyper drive when it was announced that the Queen would not be attending the ceremony at Armagh Cathedral to mark the th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s foundation.Never mind that the monarch is -years-old and apparently in such frail health that her doctors recommended she miss the event. Following that medical advice it emerged later that the Queen had been admitted to hospital in London for tests.None the less some in the media conjectured that the Queen’s non-attendance was in reality linked to Irish President Michael D Higgins’ boycott of the ecumenical religious service that somehow the absence of the British monarch avoided the “embarrassment” of only having one head of state at Armagh from these islands for all those photo-ops inside and outside St Patrick’s Cathedral.Meanwhile, on social media networks incredulity was stretched even further by those who interpreted the Queen’s non-appearance as somehow a slap in the face by the London establishment for unionists.Like the biblical star shining in the east the monarch’s absence was seen as a sign that the Brits have started their exit strategy from Northern Ireland. Which is almost as ludicrous in terms of logic and evidence as the thesis advanced last weekend that the passing of the current monarch also heralds the break-up of the UK.Amid all this frenzied wishful thinking it is important toto the facts. This type of hysteria has been fuelled by Brexit and especially the weaponisation of EU membership to advance the cause of Irish unity. However,you analyse the results of four credible opinion polls from the year the UK voted to leave the EU it is clear there has been no real tangible “Brexit-effect” on support for staying in the UK.The  Ipsos Mori poll taken after the Brexit vote showed support for the Union being over %.A year later a survey for Queen’s University Belfast found almost exactly the same backing for the Union, again more than %.Two years later in  the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies also found more than % in favour of staying in the UK.In  the Northern Ireland Le and Times Survey reported that % still opted for the Union rather than a united Ireland.The reasons for this solid base support for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK it is fair to presume are not based on intangible factors such as widespread genuine admiration for the Queen or love for the monarchy.Other far less ethereal or symbolic causes come into play here: the desire to stay in a nation with the fth largest economy in the world the free at point of use NHS the support system via the Barnett Formula provided by the UK Treasury to poorer regions including Northern Ireland a state that is multi-cultural and erse and the deeply ingrained visceral historic, familial, social connections that straddle both sides of the Irish Sea.Conversely the two-tier, American-style semi-privatised health system in the Republic the Irish State’s mounting national debt, the highest in Europe a punishing personal taxation regime and a resurgent neo-nationalism brought on in part by the decade of commemorations are among the repellent factors that will convince many to remain within the UK rather than link up with the Republic.These are the dynamics that will determine the future of the Union rather than who sits on the throne across the water. To posit the end of the longest reign of any British monarch could hasten the break up of the UK, or even that her non-attendance at a single event is a signal that it is already happening, is as absurd as waiting for the ravens to fly off from the Tower of London.• Ben Lowry Oct :Centenary church service should have celebrated Northern Ireland• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : I stand by my assessment of Fathers Gerry Reynolds and Alec Reid• Henry McDonald Oct : I am an atheist but I miss hearing Preacher Man on the streets of Belfast• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Yet across Northern Ireland, people can be reassured that they are bathing in clean and safe waters.Second, lockdown has produced a renewed interest in the province’s outdoors. It is one of the upsides of the Covid rules that we have reconnected with NI’s countryside and waters. In particular, there has been an upsurge in outdoor swimming at locations such as Helen’s Bay on the northern coast of Co Down, one of the beaches rated excellent.Swimmers are taking a dip through the winter there.Now that the beaches are reaffirmed as being of bathing quality, our politicians should be thinking of how we can increase insufficient parking space at popular beauty spots where cars are often being turned away. We should encourage those people who want to enjoy the simple pleasures of rural and coastal Northern Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, despite broad support, the project was vetoed by Sinn Fein on the grounds that it reflected “only one political perspective”. Earlier this month Sinn Fein, the largest bloc on Mid Ulster Council, blocked three landmark buildings being illuminated blue and green, along with a number of others across the UK, to mark the NI centenary.SF councillor Niamh Doris said she opposed the “celebration of something that deserves no celebration, which is the partition of this island”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I think this is why my we and I enjoy a nostalgic steam journey when we visit an area with a preserved railway, which we did recently.Although more modern engines are more efficient and cleaner, they seem to me to not have the raw power of a steam locomotive and particularly those that used to haul express trains.This book has made me think of the power we need to live in our journey of le.There may seem to be more modern ways of living with many ideas offered, but the nothing beats the power of God.It may seem old fashioned and nostalgic to think like this, but when I see Godrsquos power at work all other efforts pale into insignicance.The Bible shows Godrsquos power with Jesus healing people, raising the dead and feeding large crowds among other things.It was supremely shown when He died and rose again which is central to the Christian faith.That power is still at work today with countless lives changed when people have an encounter with Jesus and see His power at work on their behalf.We all need help in the journey of le and God is always there for us.May I suggest that we do what The Bible says this week:     \"Ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls\"PhilipGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why.

Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
