This was a suspected suicide.\u0027He was known to have issues for his knee which he was on medication for.\u0027Results from a post-mortem are still awaited, the hearing was told.Senior coroner David Horsley adjourned the inquest until November 21.  Love Island star Mike Thalassitis was found hanged in a park after taking cocaine and alcohol and leaving notes to his family. The 26-year-old, whose occupation was given as celebrity, was discovered in a park in Enfield, north London, on March 16 this year.Recording a conclusion of suicide, senior coroner Andrew Walker said: \u0027There were a number of notes left behind and messages in which Mr Thalassitis clearly set out his intention that his life should come to an end.\u0027The inquest heard toxicology results showed there was cocaine, alcohol, paracetamol and antidepressants in his system at the time of his death.Mr Walker added: \u0027The blood and urine concentrations are consistent with alcohol intoxication.\u0027Earlier this year a coroner in Tyneside issued a warning about mixing alcohol and cocaine after another Love Island star, Sophie Gradon, hanged herself having consumed both substances.The coroner at Ms Gradon’s inquest said research in the US said the combination was known to make someone 16 times more likely to kill themselves.Mr Thalassitis was found by a jogger in Church Street Recreation ground next to Haselbury Road in the north London borough where he lived shortly before 9.30am.She called a friend who advised her to contact the police, the court heard.An officer who attended the scene said a black notebook had been found near where Mr Thalassitis died.Giving evidence Pc Emma Clauson said: \u0027I looked through the notebook which was a sort of combination of a diary and letters and positive thoughts.\u0027At the back of the diary was a number of notes that had been addressed to his family.\u0027 Sophie Graydon, 32, took her own life after having a cocktail of alcohol and cocaine at her Northumberland home last June. She was approximately three-times the drink-drive limit. Coroner Eric Armstrong said people who have taken cocaine along with alcohol are 16 times more likely to attempt suicide. He said: \u0027If Sophie’s death is to serve any purpose at all, that message should go out far and wide.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"James Stunt laughs money woes fleet supercars parking tickets outside 11 5m mansion","story":"Share this article Admitting he himself was probably owed ‘millions’, Mr Ecclestone added: ‘The bottom line is, anything I did in the past was to help him, for the good of Petra, the good of his wife, and I knew exactly what the result was going to be.He said: ‘In my opinion, when he was first with Petra I thought he was a nice guy.

Two have parking tickets, and Stunt no longer has his entourage of bodyguards who used to drive around in them         Stunt’s lawyer told the High Court his client was ‘very, very’ rich but did not have access to his moneyYesterday the brash Surrey-born bullion dealer, who enjoyed a private education, complained: ‘I have to be the richest man that has ever just been made bankrupt – all because of this restraint nonsense. \u0027I can’t let my ego get in the way right now, because I’m going to win this silly bankruptcy.’He urged his online followers not to believe the Daily Mail’s court reporting, saying: ‘They’re going to write bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt – it doesn’t mean I’ve lost anything. I offered a million more, but the assets were restrained.’ He added: ‘I’m not worried, I’m not nervous at all.’Stunt, 37, had bragged he would never go bankrupt, but his excuses ran out on Thursday after a string of court hearings. He faced a towering debt pile worth £14million of allegedly unpaid bills. He owed a £1million gambling debt to a spreadbetting firm, and another £3.9million to Christie’s auction house for a Picasso. He was even being chased by his own orce lawyers, who helped negotiate his 2017 split from Miss Ecclestone, 30, for a debt of £247,000.The father of three convinced a series of judges he was on the brink of being able to settle his debts – although he disputed several of the claims – by selling off artworks including a £2.1million Monet. He also said he was prepared to sell a £1.6million work by modernist painter Marc Chagall.But High Court judge Clive Jones threw out Stunt’s application for proceedings to be adjourned and declared him bankrupt.Stunt’s barrister Timothy Higginson said criticism of his client amounted to ‘personal attacks’ and blamed his failure to comply with a previous court ruling on the restraint order. The assets will ultimately remain under the control of the CPS and the courts until the investigation is over. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Queens honour Queen","story":"Share this article   Royal aides rewarded The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s housekeeper has been recognised in the honours.Antonella Fresolone has been awarded a Royal Victorian Medal for her years of service, most recently running William and Kate’s household at Kensington Palace.The Italian, who is unmarried and in her mid-forties, started working for the couple shortly before the birth of their first child, Prince George.The £23,000-a-year position comes with a staff apartment at the palace and Miss Fresolone, with her strong work ethic, was considered a ‘shoo-in’ for the post.Before taking up her current role, she was one of the Queen’s top three housemaids and worked at Buckingham Palace for 13 years.Clive Alderton, principal private secretary to Charles and Camilla – the couple’s most senior advisor – has been made a commander of the order, while Edward Mark Bruton Priday, manager of the Queen’s bank, Coutts \u0026amp Co, has been made a member.  Medal for the Holocaust survivor who met \u0027Dr Death\u0027          Holocaust survivors George Hans Vulkan, Ernest Simon, Walter Kammerling and Ruzena Levy, at the Jewish Museum LondonSentenced to die in the gas chamber by Hitler’s notorious ‘Doctor of Death’, 14-year-old Rachel Levy believed her fate was sealed.But as she and other Jewish children waited at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, a guard allowed them to flee.Now 88 and a grandmother living in north London, Mrs Levy and other child survivors have been awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours – in recognition of their work teaching generations of children about the Holocaust.Mrs Levy, who grew up in former Czechoslovakia, said Nazi persecution in her home town began when Jewish children were barred from going to school and their families stopped from running businesses.Her father Solomon and other men were taken to a labour camp in 1941 and never returned. Later, the women and children were forced on trains to be taken to Auschwitz.Her family arrived together. But her two younger sisters, Rivka, ten, and eight-year-old Etta, and her toddler brother Ben-Zvi were too young to work so they were taken to the gas chamber immediately, along with their mother Shlima.Only Rachel and her brother Chaskiel, 16, were spared. She underwent other ‘selections’ – often overseen by Dr Josef Mengele – in which the weakest were picked out to die, as part of the extermination of around six million Jews.         Rachel Levy (back row, third from left), aged 13, with family members including her mother, a brother, two sisters and an aunt, who all diedFinally, he gestured that she too should die. But a delay forced their SS guard to listen to their cries, as they called out: ‘Why can’t you help us?’ Mrs Levy said the female guard gestured for them to run away and she hid among kitchen workers. She and thousands of other inmates were later forced to walk for 21 days from Poland to the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen in Germany in the last months of the war – the so-called ‘Death March’.Once inside Belsen, she was met by unimaginable scenes of horror, as piles of bodies were left to rot. Her aunt died in the camp and Mrs Levy contracted typhoid.Liberation came in April 1945, when British soldiers arrived. Mrs Levy and her brother Chaskiel were reunited and came to Britain.Daughter Shelley, 56, said her mother still suffered nightmares after reliving her experiences but was delighted to learn she would be honoured for her work.BEMs were also awarded to Walter Kammerling, 95, Gabrielle Keenaghan, 92, Ernest Simon, 89, George Hans Vulkan, 89, and Ann and Bob Kirk, 90 and 94, who were all brought to Britain as children to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Mr Kirk lost 20 members of his family but survived after his parents sent him to Britain from Germany in 1939, when he was 13. His wife Ann said: ‘In our talks, we always make the point that our experiences show the dangers of racial prejudice and that it is essential to treat everybody as human beings, regardless of race and religion.’The Holocaust Educational Trust estimates that those honoured have given powerful accounts to more than 100,000 schoolchildren.Karen Pollock, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘Against a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and hate, we must ensure that this period of history is taught about and known and that the memory of the past is preserved and shared so that future generations know what happened.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/05/12/14397586-0-image-m-97_1559732909102.jpg","title":"Private pictures Prince Harry Meghan Markles wedding leaked Instagram Twitter","story":"Share this articleMeghan Markle and Prince Harry’s private wedding photos leaked on Instagram after photographer is hacked – The Sun"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/05/17/3B118C5900000578-0-image-m-17_1480957531506.jpg","title":"Actress Pauley Perrette says wont return NCIS shes terrified Mark Harmon","story":"Share this article\u0027NCIS\u0027 Mess: How a Dog-Bite Divided Pauley Perette and Mark HarmonMark Harmon\u0027s Dog Attacked Crew Member on \u0027NCIS\u0027 Set | TMZ.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Danish royal family elegant display Queen Margrethe hosts dinner party","story":"                 Guests arrived at the dinner party in lavish evening gowns.

He faced a towering debt pile worth £14million of allegedly unpaid bills. He owed a £1million gambling debt to a spreadbetting firm, and another £3.9million to Christie’s auction house for a Picasso. He was even being chased by his own orce lawyers, who helped negotiate his 2017 split from Miss Ecclestone, 30, for a debt of £247,000.The father of three convinced a series of judges he was on the brink of being able to settle his debts – although he disputed several of the claims – by selling off artworks including a £2.1million Monet. He also said he was prepared to sell a £1.6million work by modernist painter Marc Chagall.But High Court judge Clive Jones threw out Stunt’s application for proceedings to be adjourned and declared him bankrupt.Stunt’s barrister Timothy Higginson said criticism of his client amounted to ‘personal attacks’ and blamed his failure to comply with a previous court ruling on the restraint order.

BP, with its plan to invest billions in new fossil fuels, is clearly intent on destroying it. By siding with the oil industry rather than the artists and art he is supposed to champion, Nicholas Cullinan seems determined to damage not only the gallery’s reputation but his own.”Hundreds of people occupied the British Museum in February in protest against its relationship with BP, and protesters say their campaign against “big oil”, and in particular BP, will be stepped up in the coming weeks.Activists from Extinction Rebellion (XR) are due to disrupt the Royal Opera House’s BP Big Screen event in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday, and the XR families group will stage a protest at the Petroleum Group annual awards dinner, which is due to be held at the National History Museum later this month.Farhana Yamin, a lawyer who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement and now coordinates XR’s International Solidarity Network, said big oil companies were in protesters’ sights.“The environmental movement is coming together and the pressure is relentless. Society will no longer normalise the actions of the oil majors,” she writes in a comment piece in the . BP “used to be a British state-owned company and it extends our emissions around the world. It must be stopped. Wherever BP goes, protest will follow.”The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) said in statement that it respected the rights of other people to express their views. “The sponsorship of the portrait award by BP is now in its 30th year and this support directly encourages the work of talented artists and helps gain wider recognition for them and enables free admission for the public, over 275,000 visitors in London last year,” it said. “Since 2010 BP has also given special support to the BP portrait award: next generation programme, which encourages 14 to 21-year-olds to become involved in painted portraiture.”A spokesperson for BP said the firm was disappointed that several artists had voiced their concerns about its support of artistic endeavours, adding that millions of people had visited exhibitions sponsored by the company.In a statement it said: “As for BP’s role in the energy transition, our position is clear. We support the Paris agreement and are taking action to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future. We’re reducing emissions from our own operations, down 1.7m tonnes last year, improving our products to support our customers’ efforts to reduce their emissions and creating new low-carbon businesses. We are committed to being part of the solution to the climate challenge facing all of us.”In his letter Hume, however, said that as the climate crisis escalated, it was time for the gallery to cut links with the fossil fuel company.“As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the gallery will look more and more out of step by hosting an oil-branded art prize,” he said. “Continuing to promote BP as the climate crisis intensifies will do unacceptable damage to the NPG’s reputation, relationships and public trust. I urge you to commit now to finding an alternative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4225fecf26da1d834d5d6fcf9b488f3a6b33ee1b/0_188_4900_2941/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a31c9f18155b7940752c1d342745800f","title":"the big picture fresh pastries old car miguel rio branco","story":"This picture is taken from a book called Maldicidade by the Brazilian photographer Miguel Rio Branco. The title translates literally from the Portuguese as “malice”, but it carries too the echoes of the words “city” and “cursed”. Rio Branco grew up the son of a diplomat, citizen of the world and for half a century his camera has given him similar licence. Though earlier work, photo essays for National Geographic for example, focused on very specific communities – the young fighters of the Santa Rosa Boxing Academy in Rio de Janeiro or the prostitutes and street children of Salvador de Bahia – he has come to reject expected labelling of time and place.The photographs in Maldicidade are uncaptioned, drawn from a lifetime of wandering the backstreets of New York, Havana, Barcelona and beyond. Rio Branco looks for those contrasts between grimy decay and daily renewal that are the universal fascination of city life. This picture, of a tray of fresh pastries served under the open bonnet of a beaten-up car, depicts exactly the kind of incongruity that his camera waits for. The colour and sweetness of those cakes contrast with the greys of the car and the street.A film-maker and painter as well as a photographer, Rio Branco has been an associate of Magnum since the 80s, but his work is not in the photojournalistic tradition that the agency is most famous for. By focusing on thematic details, he says he wants to make his pictures transcend documentary and express what he sees as poetic constants: “Time, flesh, sexuality, decay, death.”The cars in his photographs, like this one, crashed or abandoned or rusted or scrapped, tell those stories just as surely as the faces and bodies of the city’s inhabitants.Maldicidade by Miguel Rio Branco is out on 12 June (Taschen, £60)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98a93716dff43ed28305e74e85cc762372f9da6/97_851_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a907ffc9ec67800eb7babafd4523f2","title":"diary drawings daily instagram john hewitt manchester","story":"In June 2013, artist John Hewitt started making daily drawings inspired by his dog-walking encounters, and posting them on Instagram.

Get your hiking boots onIt’s hard to think of another state so richly blessed in the beautiful scenery department, and California seriously rewards travellers who take on its hiking trails. With big-hitter national parks such as Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, Joshua Tree and Death Valley all easily drivable from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, California is an ideal destination for those wanting to mix up a culture-crammed city break with awe-inspiring outdoor adventures.2. Eat the street at an iconic farmers’ marketCalifornia is deservedly proud of its fabulous fresh produce, with a farm-to-table dining scene that makes it the envy of the rest of the world. For Californians, the weekly farmers’ market has become a social institution akin to attending church, so plan to make a meal of visiting the Ferry Building Marketplace in San Francisco or San Luis Obispo’s friendly downtown market. San Diego in particular has made an art form of farmers’ markets, with countless neighbourhood markets popping up across town. If you’ve only got time to do one, make a Sunday pilgrimage to the LGBTQ-friendly, progressive neighbourhood of Hillcrest for their weekly 175-vendor market.3. Be put in your place by big treesSoaring coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) lace the coastline from just south of Big Sur to the Oregon border and beyond. Humboldt Redwoods state park is where you’ll find some of the oldest and tallest, and it’s easily accessed off Highway 101.“Farmers’ markets are a great way to support responsible travelling,” says Flight Centre’s Brown. “It’s pretty easy to do in Cali, as it’s the largest agricultural producer in the US.”4. Sip Chardonnay by the seaCalifornian wine is popular around the planet, but it really does taste better when you’re staring out at the crashing waves of the Pacific. A favourite spot is the clifftop restaurant of Nepenthe in Big Sur, where you can choose from more than 400 local tipples.5. Go vintage shopping in Joshua TreeThe other-worldly landscape of Joshua Tree national park is the area’s main draw, but a cluster of quirky desert communities are well worth lingering in. Close neighbours Pioneertown, Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley are all worth a snoop, and keep a particular eye out for the excellent vintage shopping on offer. Local designers and makers are showcased at Shop on the Mesa, while Hoof \u0026amp the Horn does excellent vintage gear, and The Station is a great spot to linger over a latte after finding some retro treasure. Rise with the birds at the weekend to snaffle bargains at the Sky Village Swap Meet before the sun gets into its stride.6. Cycle the beach path from Santa Monica to VeniceSanta Monica and the neighbouring, more hipster, Venice are LA’s best-loved city beach communities. Grab a Breeze bike and cruise down the coast, past the kitsch pier amusements, skateboarders, beachfront bars and fitness fanatics working out at Muscle Beach.7. Take a taco tour of LAWhat Indian food is to Londoners, Mexican cuisine is to Angelenos. The best taco trucks are found in the traditionally Hiic neighbourhoods of Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as downtown. Stalk cult taco trucks Guerrilla Tacos and Korean-infused Kogi BBQ on Instagram (@guerillatacos and @kogibbq) to gorge like a local.8. Immerse yourself in San Francisco’s colourful cultureFew cities can claim the cultural clout of San Francisco – synonymous, as it is, with beat poetry, jazz and alternative rock, the 1970s counterculture movement, and LGBTQ voices. For literature lovers, sipping a beer in the Vesuvio Cafe beloved by beat generation writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as the likes of Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas, will send a shiver down your spine. The famous City Lights bookstore is literally next door.“The murals of San Francisco are an Instagrammer’s dream,” says Brown. “The Mission district has the highest concentration of street art of any neighbourhood in the world.”9. Breakfast with the stars in MalibuLA’s Malibu Farm Pier Cafe at the end of the pier is one of the best positioned beach cafes on the planet. If you can tear your eyes away from the sea views, you’ll spot local celebrities sipping Vietnamese coffees and nibbling avocado on toast behind oversized sunglasses.10. Laze by the pool in Palm SpringsA playground for the rich and famous since the Brat Pack made it their home in the 1950s, Palm Springs is a must-visit for lovers of modernist architecture, poolside bars and luxury hotels.

During the day, he studied literature at Brooklyn College and worked in a cafe. At night, he stayed up writing poems. It wasn’t just the sense of isolation that comes from being the only one awake, when “you look out of the window and it’s completely dark and you’re at sea in this little ship”. It was more that writing in the off-hours relaxed his knack for self-criticism. “You get the last word of the day,” he says. “The editor in your head – the nagging, insecure, worrisome social editor – starts to retire. When that editor falls asleep, I get to do what I want. The cat’s out to play.”The poems that came out of those night-time efforts were published in 2016 as Night Sky With Exit Wounds, the success of which still amazes the author – the book won a Whiting award that year, and in 2017 scooped both the Forward prize and the TS Eliot prize. Vuong, who is 30, was not from a background from which writers traditionally emerge. As a two-year-old, he had been brought to the US from Vietnam as a refugee and settled with his family in the working-class town of Hartford, Connecticut. No one in his family spoke English. When his father left, his mother got work in a nail salon, menial work for little reward and a quality of life that Vuong had no particular expectation of exceeding. If Night Sky tackled the absent father as myth, then his debut novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, reckons with the mother and grandmother who raised him and it is the influence of these women – courageous, difficult, devastated by the ripple effect of the Vietnam war – that forms the spine of the novel and asks the central question: after trauma, how do we love?We are in Vuong’s open-plan living room in Northampton, Massachusetts, a leafy college town where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Peter, his partner of 10 years, has taken the dog out. Vuong is slight, with a silver earring in one ear and the habit of pushing his tortoiseshell glasses up his nose. He speaks, as he writes, in poetic imagery, what he calls “the metaphor as autobiography of the gaze”. In the novel, the world seen through a speeding car window “surges by like sidewise gravity”. A bird on a windowsill appears not as a bucolic symbol but “a charred pear”. To Little Dog, the protagonist – so named by his family to protect him beneath a cloak of worthlessness – the world is an ugly place, in which beauty is made more so for the improbability of existing at all. “Freedom,” he says, “is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.”That On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is one of the most anticipated novels of the year – the novelist Max Porter has called it “staggeringly beautiful”, observing that “it seems obvious now that a gay young poet born in Saigon would write the great American novel” – is, in large part, down to its perfect engineering, a piece of autobiographical fiction that avoids all the traps of that genre. It is fluid, moving the way thought moves, in circles not lines, and written in the form of a letter to Little Dog’s mother that he knows she’ll never read. It is easy to imagine a bad version of this novel in which any one of its preoccupations might have overgrown to capsize it. It might have been the Opioid Novel, or the Vietnam Novel, or the Exploitative World of the Nail Salon novel. It might have been the Gay Adolescent Love novel or the Violent Childhood novel, all themes that are touched upon lightly while still assuming a fully weighted presence in the narrative. How Vuong does this is a mystery, as is the seamlessness with which he moves between scenes of violence in the Vietnam war to scenes of violence in the home in Connecticut, to love scenes with a doomed boy called Trevor. The book has a poetic density that is at once elliptical and unflinching in its gaze, a testimony to the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage. “Sometimes being offered tenderness,” writes Vuong, “feels like the very proof that you’ve been ruined.”Vuong grew up in a world in which he was marginalised across every axis – class, race, sexuality. His was a violent household. In a memoir piece he wrote for the New Yorker two years ago, which would form the basis of many scenes in the novel, Vuong, addressing his mother, recalled “the time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag.” And,“the time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood.” And, “the time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles.”Post-traumatic stress disorder was something no one had any idea about at the time, “except in veterans”. But there is no question, looking back, that both his grandmother, who saw her village in Vietnam razed by US soldiers, and his mother, ripped from everything familiar for a new life in the US, where her husband beat her before leaving, were suffering from PTSD. Violence was the ugly expression of this trauma, but with distance, Vuong could see a positive release of that energy, too – chiefly in the way that his mother and grandmother told stories.“I didn’t know this until I talked to other Vietnamese-Americans – that it was rare for families to talk about the war,” he says. Partly it came out of boredom. They were broke, stuck in the house with each other and “we had no TV”. But there was something else going on, too. “The stories, at first, were folklore. My grandmother would tell a ghost story, then she would say: oh, that was after the napalm. So through cycles of these stories, that world started opening and as a child I would ask: what’s napalm? They ploughed on. It was almost intoxicating for them to create a mythology of their lives, because they were so powerless. They were all women. The men were gone they did their harm and were gone. And they were empty hands, had no English, were powerless everywhere else. But when it was time to tell the story, they held everything.”Vuong had no context for what he was hearing. He only knew that in the stories, these women who counted for nothing outside, ran through the fire and survived. “They turned themselves into myths and it had a rhetorical power. They turned themselves into the Odyssey.”In the novel, the trauma of Little Dog’s mother and grandmother shines through in grimly humorous ways. Lan, the grandmother, yelling at his addled mother to get back in the car, shouts to get through to her, “get back in the helicopter”. Buying a dress from the Salvation Army, his mother asks Little Dog to read the label and find out, “is it fireproof?” In the family mythology, Vuong was the single last hope of these indestructible women and when, in the mid-2000s, Hartford was hit by the opioid epidemic, it’s the thing that stopped him from leaning towards drugs. “A lot of my friends were dying. And I thought: OK, I can die.” Worn out by poverty, bullying, bereavement and violence, he regarded this outcome as regrettable, but “I think that might not have been enough, were it not for me being my family ’s only hope. Because they were also dying, in a different way: financially, mentally. And I thought, I can’t die. Literally I can’t die.” He wanted to change his family’s story. He wanted to make his mother happy. He wanted to exceed the expectations of someone born to his station in life.So what did he do?He smiles. “I went to business school.”There was a year in early adulthood when Vuong and his mother didn’t speak. He knew life had been hard for her, leaving Vietnam and dealing with his father, about whom he knows very little other than that after his mother kicked him out, he “went off to do criminal things and ended up going to jail”. But he hadn’t yet got to the stage of forgiving her. “It was the worst, for both of us,” he says. “And when we looked at each other again, we just sobbed and said: oh, we can’t do that. We’ve got to find a way.” This happened before Vuong had written a single line, and it was important “a pivotal moment to understand that anger destroys, not only those around you, but especially yourself. Anger is energy – you can get a lot done with anger you can write multiple books. We’ve read those books and you realise as you’re reading them: oh, this is not for me. It’s their own project. So I didn’t want to write angry. I didn’t want to be angry. I saw what anger did, growing up, and it was powerful, a force to be reckoned with, but it didn’t lead to anywhere that I was interested in going.”This isn’t the received wisdom among many of those applying to study creative writing at college, where it is sometimes assumed that having something to rage about is a definite advantage. After eight weeks at business school – which he characterises as “learning to lie” – Vuong dropped out and enrolled to read literature at Brooklyn College. He started to write poetry. And then he had an unsettling experience.The idea of Vuong’s childhood as a generator of great material for fiction is one that makes him laugh like a drain. These days, if any of his upper-middle-class students grouse that they don’t have a good backstory, he mildly points out that Virginia Woolf got one of the best novels ever written out of someone basically crossing a lawn. At the time, however, he was shocked and disappointed. He hadn’t been prepared for the merciless competition of the New York poetry crowd “which depended on appearances, soirees and parties. So I just holed up in my apartment and the library.” His confidence cratered. He wondered if he’d made a terrible mistake. Then he hit upon an unexpected remedy. “A huge moment in my education as a writer was reading biographies. I beg my students to do it, because everything that they’re feeling, Sylvia Plath felt 70 years ago. And Ginsburg and Lorca and Rimbaud. There’s Virginia Woolf, this genius, who’s going on a crisis walk. You read the prose and you would never think this woman has any doubt. And yet here she is, out there, asking: what am I doing?”Vuong thinks he was lucky in some ways. “I had no pressure. I could really experiment with my voice. I could play, and find pleasure in it. I see with my students that they’re under a lot of pressure from their families. A parent will say to me: “my future Pulitzer winner!” and I just groan. Poor kid. What do you say to that?”He started going to open mic poetry events, which were shabbier and more democratic than formal readings, and at one of which he met a law student called Peter. To that point, Vuong’s relationships had been largely dysfunctional, “bad, bad relationships in almost this cliched trope of seeing what’s familiar in violent, self-destructive folks”. His horizons had been limited in other ways, too. It is an odd side-effect of poverty that you become trapped in a previous era, he says new things take longer to arrive, and when they do, no one has time to absorb them. “You don’t have no time. That’s the thing everybody in my community says: I ain’t got no time for that!” He laughs. “Being poor is about waiting, I learned. You’re waiting in line for welfare. You go to the ER, you wait. You want to file for sexual assault? You wait. And so everybody’s in a queue and one thing that happens is that you’re in a cultural time warp. You’re in the past. So when I went to New York in 2007, I had no iPhone, no Facebook in my community, when it comes to technology and access, they are mostly in the late 90s.”They were also culturally fairly regressive, although in his own home at least, homophobia was one of Vuong’s lesser problems. (There is a heartbreaking bit in the novel in which Little Dog wakes to find “FAG4LIFE” scrawled on his family’s front door in red paint and he tells his mum that it reads: “Merry Christmas, Ma. See? That’s why it’s red. For luck.”) When he was growing up, his mother and grandmother weren’t thrilled by his sexuality, but “because they came from a long line of rice farmers, they were close to native traditions in Vietnam, and those communities had intersex folks who were seen as having all-seeing power. They were powerful people and there was a mysticism associated with that. That doesn’t mean they hoped their children would be queer. But although they were shocked, they had a very practical way of looking at things. That’s what I admired about them. Their view is that this is borrowed time. We should’ve been gone up in smoke. But now we’re here, let’s just live.”The downside to this attitude was economic ruin. “It leads to financial woes and bankruptcy. Maxed-out credit cards.” He’s laughing now. “OK, after 20 years, the party’s over! Let’s think about savings! They’re all in financial ruts because they had that mentality.”It was a joyfulness, or at least a somewhat constructive outlook, that Vuong associates with women who emerge from trauma as opposed to destructive and self-destructing men. It still amazes him, looking back, how the women in his family – his mother, his grandmother, his aunts – dealt with the threat of their husbands. “The incredible thing that I can never quite understand was how they were able to kick them all out. The men had access to jobs, money, a patriarchal presence in the world, and even though they had troubles too, as immigrants and refugees, we come from a patriarchal tradition in the old country just as deeply rooted as in the west. In some cases, when men are talking to each other, women aren’t supposed to even be in the room. So that was what they were coming out of. And to think orce?! These things were still taboo where they came from. And they all really did it.”The question of courage underlines everything Vuong writes, both in terms of the characters and in the nerve held by the writer creating them. Night Sky With Exit Wounds, published when he was 27, and which “took off in ways that no poet ever suspects will happen, and should not expect again”, dared to imagine scenes in which brutality and sensuality combined. (In one scene, the poet describes his father masturbating in a bathroom after he has beaten his mother, observing “that a man in climax is the closest thing to surrender”.) The novel has a similarly shocking breadth of sympathies. In both, Vuong’s ultimate aim was to dignify the experiences of his childhood with the solemn, years-long gaze of the novelist.“The great male writers of the European tradition, be it Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, deemed that those most inspiring to them existed in a white aristocracy,” he says. “You read those books and you wouldn’t even know that people of colour existed in Europe. To each his own, and that was their choice. But I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people – these lives are worthy of literature. As Turgenev looked at the crumbling Russian empire, I look at these folks in a different crumbling empire and deemed that these are inspiring lives to an artist.”He also wanted to say something about where the cost of war falls, not from the vantage point of the grand historical epic, but from inside the small, cramped sadness of a house still flattened decades after the conflict has ended. “It’s the stories of our species that men create these wars and women clean them up. They clean them up emotionally, they have to deal with the PTSD that comes home, they have to postpone their own healing, forgo their own self-care, in order to hold these households together. They literally nurse these broken bodies back to health. I wanted a book to honour that without romanticising it. To say women have been doing this and they’re not necessarily these heroic legends. What’s the mental cost of the women who do these extraordinary things? In the book, the cost is their own private life.”A few months ago, Vuong’s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and he has been commuting back and forth to Hartford to accompany her to chemotherapy. After a dire admission to hospital, during which, he says, she was in so much pain “it sounded like warfare and I was ready to bury her”, she is responding to treatment and even hopes to come to his book launch. He thinks of something she said to him when he first left for New York. “She told me: it’s OK for people to think you’re a fool.” Vuong laughed and said: “Really? Why?” and his mother replied: “Because then they’ll tell you everything about them. You can see them from all their angles.” It’s the wisdom of his life. The subversive power of being “a small, queer, person of colour” is that Vuong has the ability to see everything. He smiles. “Nobody hides themselves from a fool.”• On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is published by Jonathan Cape (£12.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

But it might never have been published if it wasn’t for the intervention of a mystery author‘I’m a person,” says Tayari Jones, the morning after carrying off the Women’s prize for fiction for her fourth novel, An American Marriage, “who before this had never even won a raffle. Truly. I remember, as a child, you could win a whole summer of ice-cream and I saved and I bought several tickets. I did not win and the little girl who won only had one ticket. How about that? I’ve been holding that grudge for 40 years.”An American Marriage, the story of a black man falsely imprisoned for a violent assault on a woman he glancingly meets in an Atlanta motel, has certainly transformed Jones’s literary fortunes. Crucially, it caught the eye of Oprah Winfrey, who last year selected it for her Book Club – a guarantee of enormously enhanced sales and profile. Then came the moment when the former US president Barack Obama included it on his increasingly celebrated list of summer reading, praising its “moving portrayal of the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple”.It’s easy to see what attracted Winfrey and Obama: the novel turns outwards to address the immense and seemingly intractable issues around the incarceration of black men, and at the same time never loses sight of the traumatic effects of injustice on its victims’ most intimate relationships. As its title suggests, it’s concerned not only with Roy, the young man from a working-class Atlanta family keen to grab all the opportunities life offers him, but with his wife, Celestial, an artist from a far more moneyed and socially elevated background. When I remark that two of the writers shortlisted for the Women’s prize, Pat Barker and Madeline Miller, set their stories in ancient Greece, Jones points out that An American Marriage is itself in conversation with The Odyssey, the story of a man trying simply to get home to his wife and of a wife who, left alone to hold the fort, is faced with the dilemma of how far to proceed with her own life.When people question Jones about the minutiae of the crime at the book’s heart, she counters strongly: “I don’t want this to be a story about the police. I don’t want this to be a story about law enforcement. This is not a procedural. This is the story about a family affected by wrongful conviction, about what they owe each other and the ways that they will move forward. I think that when we forget that part of stories, we are actually dismantling community.”Which is not to say that Jones, 48, turns away from the stark political realities the novel is built on she spent a year at Harvard doing research for the book and, even on this short trip to Britain, has found time to visit Brixton prison in south London, home to the inmate-run restaurant The Clink. The decision to write about imprisonment, she says, “wasn’t any big lightning bolt. I feel that the idea of incarceration has always been, in many ways, the boogie man under the bed for black America. There’s a fear, particularly among the middle class, that you’ll do everything right – you’ll go to school, you’ll do this, you’ll do that – and then the system will just come and abduct you. That is the monster under the bed, and I wanted to look under the bed and face it head on.” She says her concern spreads beyond clear miscarriages of justice to encompass the vast numbers of those in jail for non-violent drug offences, or who are mentally ill. “I’m not only interested in the ‘innocent people’ when we make that distinction between innocent and not innocent, we miss the major issues about prison reform.”But while the horror thrown up by her research was stopping her from sleeping, it was not, she tells me, “moving my pen … I felt like I was trying to animate statistics”. (She also recalls being advised to put more overt political content in the novel, “as if I had some Black Lives Matter in my handbag”.) Conscious of the advice that you should write fiction about people and their problems, not problems and their people, she one day found herself in a mall, tuning into a couple’s argument. “I heard the woman say: ‘Roy, you know you wouldn’t have waited on me for seven years.’ And he said: ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. This wouldn’t have happened to you in the first place.’”Jones grew up in Atlanta, the child of professors – her father is a political scientist and her mother an economist Jones remembers a childhood spent not eating grapes, in support of farm workers in California, and boycotting the products of apartheid South Africa. I ask how close the mall conversation felt to a reality she could recognise. In answer, she recalls an incident from her childhood, at a time when a serial killer was murdering young black boys, crimes that she used as the basis for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Two of the 28 murder victims went to her school. One night, her father was driving a family friend home and got lost. When he got back, he was shaken. “He said: ‘I was just driving around those dark streets, I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t have anyone to vouch for where I had been, and I was so afraid I would be pulled over.’ It was the first time in my life I had seen my father afraid … and I now understand, he was just afraid that being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time could have ruined his life.”Jones’s UK visit has, of course, coincided with that of another American, Donald Trump. “He’s following me,” she sighs. I ask whether she feels that the great regression sweeping her country – the rise of the far right, the rolling back of the rights of women and of minorities – feels like a threat to the fragile gains of civil rights activists. She points to what feels like an epidemic of the police being summoned to “black people doing ordinary things in ordinary places” she makes sure that when she arrives at a cafe, she orders coffee immediately, to signal that she is a patron rather than a trouble-maker or a vagrant. She has stopped looking at her neighbourhood website to which people upload their video doorbell footage because of the occasions on which neighbours would mark as suspicious the perfectly legitimate comings and goings of black people (including, she tells me, those canvassing for the Democrat politician Stacey Abrams). “I am sometimes appalled,” she says, “at what my neighbours find to be suspicious.” She is preoccupied now with what happens in a post-Trump world. “Let’s say Trump is not re-elected. Let’s say all over the world, these far-right regimes are put down. How will we live with our neighbours, knowing what we now know of them?”Jones now has a platform, but even a few years ago it was looking decidedly precarious. She couldn’t find a publisher for her third novel, and her first two, well-received critically but not huge sellers, had fallen out of print. That third novel, Silver Sparrow, was firmly relegated to a drawer. Invited to a book festival, she went out of obligation, but was feeling embarrassed – as though her lack of success disqualified her from being there. But while she was there, a woman said: “I can help you.”“I didn’t take it very seriously because you meet a lot of unusual people on the road with unusual ideas. But she literally put my hand in the hand of a publisher.” They chatted, and before they said goodbye, the publisher asked her how she knew Judy. Oh, replied Jones, I don’t know anyone called Judy. “‘No,’ she says, ‘I mean Judy Blume, who just introduced us.’ It was like my childhood had rescued me in my hour of need. I turned to thank her, and she had vanished.”At this moment, we turn to order some coffee. On the table is a bouquet given to her at the awards ceremony, which she wants to bring to her publishers’ office so that they can enjoy it too. She is wreathed in smiles. I explain to the waiter that she has just won a prize. Suddenly, two glasses of champagne arrive. It is 11.30 in the morning, but it’s not every day that you pick up a major literary award. “I will if you will,” says Jones.An American Marriage is published by Oneworld (£8.99).

Woodford, one of the UK’s best-known stockpickers, suspended all trading in the fund “until further notice” after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets.Hill said: “I would like to apologise personally to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems with the Woodford equity income fund. We all share their disappointment and frustration. Our priority right now is to support our clients and keep them informed.”Woodford said last week the fund would reopen as soon as was “practicable after these exceptional circumstances have ceased”, and that the suspension would be reviewed “at least every 28 days”.Hill said: “The shortcomings of one fund should not detract from the benefits of favourite fund lists like the Wealth 50.”His firm has come under fire from investors who will not be able to access their investments until the suspension is lifted. Investors have also criticised the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, for failing to see the risks taken by Woodford.The former City minister Lord Myners said the FCA “should have been awake” to problems at the fund, telling the BBC that the regulator had missed “clear warning signs” that things were going badly.On Thursday, Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, said investors should not be charged management fees while trading in the fund was suspended.Concerns were raised last year after a series of poor performances by companies part-owned by Woodford funds, many of them not listed on the stock market, making them difficult to sell.Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, defended the regulator and Woodford’s decision to suspend the fund. “The alternative would have been much more disorderly,” Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday.He offered assurances that the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as the fund manager started to sell off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash. Bailey said it was important for funds like Woodford’s to invest in unlisted firms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce169b8dad1d0497e73454c0435deda367914869/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b28aed8aa07e672d4da5aeb205a704","title":"what is the future for sir philip green","story":"As Sir Philip Green’s retail empire faces the prospect of entering administration, putting 18,000 jobs at risk, the  business reporter Sarah Butler discusses how we got here.

But on Monday, there is a chance that this could be lifted.Whatever happens, it is clear we need wider resolution on this debate in order to draw a firm line under it. To do so there are two challenges we need to tackle. One is the call of parental rights. The other is the idea of what is “age appropriate”.Speaking as a parent, my rights are important. I know my children better than anyone. I care for them more than anyone. Both my motives and my knowledge mean that I am most likely to know what’s best for them.But my rights are not unlimited. They do not trump all other concerns or viewpoints. No parent in modern society has unlimited rights. We are not free to neglect, abuse or hurt our children, for example. It is not a valid argument simply to claim “parental rights” as if that automatically overrides all other considerations. We have to dig deeper.The boundaries of parental rights are relatively straightforward when it comes to physical or emotional harm. But what about knowledge and values? Do I have a right to determine what my children learn and believe by controlling their access to other viewpoints and sources of information?This is where parental rights reach their limits. Clearly I should protect my children from some harmful views and knowledge – hatred, incitement, radicalisation. Clearly I have a right to teach my values and beliefs to my child – again assuming that I am not teaching hatred or inciting illegal behaviour. But no parent has a right to restrict their children from learning about other safe and legal values and other perspectives on the world. Not restricting knowledge seems to me to be the best criteria for balancing the rights of parents, young people and society as a whole. It is the exposure to multiple perspectives that gives young people the strongest start in life and the ability to make their own choices.There are many sources of knowledge and values for young people, and our schools are one of them. Their duty is to pass on what we as a society believe is true and what we believe is right and so equip young people for life after school in a complex world.What is true and what is right are always contestable, but the place for this contest to work itself out is through our politics, not in front of the gates of schools. Once something has made its way into law or policy, schools should not be targets.I know parents may feel that the weight of the government and authority figures can overwhelm their own teachings. This is an understandable source of fear. Schools should open conversation with parents so this fear can be addressed. But parents should not underestimate their own influence, nor overestimate that of schools.So let’s switch from the abstract to the concrete. As a society we have decided, through democratic procedures and enshrinement in law, that everyone is equally valued whatever their sexuality or gender identity. That there is no single recipe for a happy family and that we celebrate all loving homes. Schools therefore have a duty to highlight ersity in families. Parents can offer an alternative belief but they do not have the right to restrict their children from hearing what schools have to say. This is not “brainwashing”. Young people are being exposed to multiple viewpoints. Teaching such things doesn’t change who they are – it just helps them feel more confident and proud of who they are. There is no inappropriate age to learn about these things – they do not fall into the domain of dangerous knowledge.LGBT rights are not something that inidual headteachers are pursuing on a whim or as a personal agenda. They are public servants reflecting the choices of government. For many teachers right now doing their job isn’t easy. It would really help if the government could move away from the language of headteachers’ “discretion” on this topic and if we took more seriously the idea of a national curriculum, applied to all schools whatever their status. Teachers and school leaders are exposed and vulnerable the government is powerful. It should stop asking teachers to do the difficult work for it and use its power for good.• Russell Hobby is head of the teacher-training organisation Teach First and a former general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e693f85bca3afd3ed3a1431529568fa673b3dbc/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bba2bcadff8cc4c4c620fa657857637","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sunny","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sunny’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sunny’.Share your photos of what sunny means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 June at 10am.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

Our education experts reveal how to lift the veil and find out what life is like at each university“Choosing your course at university is a bit like choosing your life partner,” says Mary Curnock Cook. “You need to be in love with it first.“If you’re not getting that flutter of excitement when you read the course details and the module options, then you could be in for three years of hard labour. If you get it right, your degree and the university experience will genuinely be part of your future.”There is no shortage of information out there for students thinking of going to university. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The biggest problem is the sheer volume of stuff to read and the number of experts to consult. But out of all the voices, the column inches written, the glossy prospectuses and burgeoning websites, Cook is one of those worth listening to.Now an independent educationalist, she worked for seven years as chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, Ucas, which oversees applications to British universities. Millions of applications went through on her watch between 2010 and 2017, a period of enormous change and expansion in higher education. Her expert view is that enthusiasm for a subject and attention to the detail of the course are paramount.Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Bath University, believes the course is more important than which university you go to. He urges students to find out exactly what a course involves and how it’s assessed. “Not all history degrees are the same,” says Nicholson. “Does it cover the sort of things you are interested in? How much contact time does the course involve – how many lectures, seminars and tutorials can you expect each week? What’s the workload like and who will teach you? And how is your own work going to be judged?“A lot of students make assumptions that a degree will be just like school, with the same sorts of assessment,” he says.But this varies hugely, from three-hour end-of-year exams, to continuous assessment through the year, group work and projects. “Lots of that information is available on university websites, but if you can’t find the answer, email the admissions department to find out,” adds Nicholson.He also urges students to look at employment outcomes for graduates who have studied a particular course. If you want to be a journalist, ask universities how many graduates from that particular course now have jobs in the media.“Universities are getting more open with the information they provide,” he says. Prospective students who ask lots of questions are seen favourably. “They show all the signs of being active and engaged.”If you look at the  subject tables, you’ll find a column for “career after six months”. This tells you what percentage of students have graduate-level jobs (or have gone on to further study) six months after graduation.Everyone the  talked to for this article, including former students, university admissions officers and sixth-form careers advisers, urged all students to visit on open days if they possibly can. Go twice if you can afford to.If you miss the open day, arrange an alternative date – universities are desperate to recruit and will be happy to accommodate you. Talk to as many people as possible – students and staff – and spend time on campus and in town to get a sense of a place and whether you might fit in.“Don’t discount gut instinct,” one career development expert says. “When making your decisions, feeling that you can ‘see yourself somewhere’ after a visit is a powerful driver.”Catherine Webster, a careers and HE adviser at Hereford sixth-form college, agrees. “A lot of students think they can work out what they want to do just by looking at words and pictures. It’s only when they get to a place and get a feel for it, that they can decide what’s right for them.”Webster concurs that subject and course are far more important than place. “Fundamentally, it’s most important for them to decide what they want to study rather than where. Establish what they’re interested in and good at, then look at which places do that well. It’s all about research really. It’s using reliable resources and being prepared to do some serious homework.”She recommends starting early: year 10 or 11. Others suggest even before that – when pupils are making GCSE choices in year 9. “The sooner you start to explore these ideas, the more confident you’ll feel later.”But Webster understands that some young people can feel overwhelmed and just aren’t ready to decide. “I feel sorry for students who don’t know what they want to do. They are carried along on a wave of presumptions: ‘You’re doing A-levels so therefore you must be going to university.’ We have to cut them a bit of slack. A reasonable proportion just aren’t ready to make that decision. They should not feel pressurised. You can take a gap year, as long as it’s productive.”If you like the look of a course and a university, Nicholson suggests you look into optional extras on offer, like internships and placements. At Bath, every degree course offers students the opportunity to do placements in the UK or abroad. He says it’s worth drilling down to find out what exactly is on offer – is the university saying it’s happy for you to organise your own placement, or will staff actively help you find a placement? “It’s a big decision, so students should be using this time to do as much research as possible.”If you have a disability or special education need, discuss it with the university. You need reassurance that you’ll get the support you require so you can make your choice without any concerns on that front. “It’s worth starting a conversation early on with a university – before you apply – if there are health issues or mitigating circumstances,” Nicholson advises.Mental health support is another big issue. Though the higher education sector has woken up to the crisis in its midst, there is variability in the quality and quantity of support and counselling available.Use open days to ask about support services and how to access them, urges Dr Ruth Caleb, former head of counselling at Brunel University and an expert on student mental health. Can students make direct contact with counselling services themselves, or is there a triage system, where students’ needs are assessed according to urgency? Are the triage teams professionally qualified?Another good question is whether there is a personal tutor system. How many students are assigned to each tutor, and how often can you see your tutor? “Tutors are often a first point of call for students who are struggling,” says Caleb. Caleb is particularly concerned about the state of mind of students who experience disappointment on results day and fail to get into their university of choice, then make a quick decision to go somewhere entirely different through the clearing system. “Students are most successful in a place where they are happy. I suggest all universities look after their clearing students and make sure they are happy to be there,” she says.There are dozens of questions to consider: campus v city, cost of accommodation, night life, societies, facilities, cost of gym membership, travel costs to and from home, work opportunities if you need to support your own learning.But let’s end with another nugget of wisdom from former Ucas chief, Mary Curnock Cook, and it’s a message to parents.“I don’t want to upset mum and dad,” she says, “but please remember, this is your child’s future, not your past. Support your son or daughter in a way that makes them feel empowered to make this big decision without worrying whether the parents might approve.”In other words – parents, back off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6701a0f002af410b8ad5c378d2fde2ed835a68/0_328_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd089b97b4e86ee853e740bb0a2309a1","title":"energy firms buy electricity from household rooftop solar panels","story":"Britain’s biggest energy companies will have to buy renewable energy from their own customers under new laws to be introduced this week.Homeowners who install new rooftop solar panels from 1 January 2020 will be able to lower their bills by selling the energy they do not need to their supplier.A record was set at noon on a Friday in May 2017, when solar energy supplied around a quarter of the UK’s electricity. However, solar panel owners are not always at home on sunny days to reap the benefit. The new rules will allow them to make money if they generate electricity for the grid.Labour accused the government last week of “actively dismantling” the solar industry. The sector will still struggle this summer as the change does not come in for another seven months, so homeowners have no incentive to buy panels this year.Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the government wanted to increase the number of small-scale generators without adding the cost of subsidies to energy bills. “The future of energy is local and the new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,” he said. The government also hopes to encourage homes with solar panels to install batteries.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said: “These smart export tariffs are game-changing when it comes to harnessing the power of citizens to tackle climate change”.A few suppliers, including Octopus, already offer to buy solar power from their customers.“They mean homes and businesses can be paid for producing clean electricity just like traditional generators, replacing old dirty power stations and pumping more renewable energy into the grid. This will help bring down prices for everyone as we use cheaper power generated locally by our neighbours,” Jackson said.Léonie Greene, a director at the Solar Trade Association, said it was “vital” that even “very small players” were paid a fair price. “We will be watching the market like a hawk to see if competitive offers come forward that properly value the power that smart solar homes can contribute to the decarbonising electricity grid,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9e47da54e2f5310435e703d014c78857de565f/0_265_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dc3db79708dfe7d8b56a87f84bdb9d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"White tiger cubs, urban deer and many millions of ladybirds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1d966da41f4f6689279807d9e90a6dc366c36f/0_2570_4716_2827/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc5fea23df6eef5637ef54e50c94e44","title":"nigel slater asparagus pakora and strawberry ricotta puffs recipes","story":"A simple summer feast that’s fit for a princessI remember being a waiter in a restaurant when Princess Margaret came to dinner – a very late after-theatre supper for 25. The guests came dressed in bow ties and long dresses, and sat down not to a feast but to a single course: just six fat spears of asparagus on a large, white plate with hollandaise sauce. They ate, washed their hands in the silver finger bowls then got up and left. I had yet to eat asparagus and remember thinking how special these long green spears must be if they were the only thing a princess had for dinner.The charms of that vegetable have never dimmed. Asparagus is still special, luxurious and somehow magical. It is one of the delights of early summer and, like the first strawberries, we must be quick if we are to make the most of it.Strawberries are a joy eaten unadorned, but we can have fun with them, too, as I did this week, stuffing them into plump choux buns.I never tire of asparagus, but I do use it more liberally as the season draws to a close. Those early-season spears get little more than a silk coat of hollandaise but, later, they turn up in tarts and salads. The thin, young spears are perfect tempura material, taking very little time to cook. Fatter stems need more time, so a thicker pakora-style batter made with chickpea flour is well suited.gram flour 150gground hot chilli 1 tspground turmeric 1 tspground coriander 1 tspwater 150mlasparagus 150goil for deep fryingFor the raita:lime 1, ripe and turning yellowavocado 1natural yogurt 200gginger 30ggroundnut oil 1 tbspyellow mustard seeds 1 tspnigella seeds 1 tspMake the batter: put the gram flour into a medium-sized bowl, then add the ground chilli, turmeric and coriander and mix together thoroughly. Pour in the water, beating out any lumps with a small whisk, then set aside to rest.Trim the asparagus, discarding the ends of the stalks, and cut the spears into short lengths.Make the raita grate the zest from the lime and put most of it in a small mixing bowl, reserving a little for later. Take care not to include any of the bitter white pith. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl. Halve, stone and peel the avocado, roughly chop the flesh, then crush into the lime juice using a fork. Stir the yogurt into the avocado.Peel the ginger and grate it, using a very fine-toothed grater, producing a thick, ivory-coloured purée. Stir most of it into the yogurt, setting a little aside for later. Warm the groundnut oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat. Add the mustard and nigella seeds and warm until fragrant and the mustard seeds turn a slightly darker shade. Spoon the seeds and oil over the surface of the raita, then sprinkle over the reserved lime zest and ginger.Get the deep-frying oil hot, bringing it slowly to 180C on a cooking thermometer. Stir the batter a couple of times then add the asparagus, coating each piece thoroughly. When the oil is up to temperature, lift the pieces of asparagus with a pair of kitchen tongs and lower carefully into the hot oil. They should sizzle immediately.Let the asparagus cook for 4 or 5 minutes, turning as necessary, until the batter is pale gold. Lift each one out with a draining spoon or tongs, and place on kitchen paper for a few seconds before piling on to a serving dish. Bring to the table with the raita.At cookery school in Paris we filled crisp choux balls with strawberry sorbet. Once the buns were risen, we took them from the oven, cut them open and returned them to the heat to dry out. Woe betide anyone with a soggy centre.For the buns:water 125mlbutter 50gstrong white flour 75gsalt a pinchegg 2, beatenbeaten egg a little, for glazingFor the pistachio sugar:caster sugar 40gshelled pistachios 30gmint leaves 16For the filling:raspberries 100gstrawberries 200gdouble cream 150mlricotta 100gSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.

Stir with a wooden spoon to a thick paste, then remove from the heat. Transfer to the bowl of a food mixer and add the 2 beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating fast with a flat paddle attachment. When you have a thick, creamy dough, ide into 4, placing it in spoonfuls on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between. Brush gently with a little beaten egg then bake for about 25 minutes until crisp and puffed up. Slice each bun open to let the steam out then return to the oven for 5 minutes. Cool the buns on a wire cooling rack.To make the pistachio sugar, put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and process to a fragrant, bright green sugar and set aside.For the filling, blitz the raspberries in a food processor then push through a sieve to extract the seeds. Thinly slice the strawberries then toss them in the raspberry purée. Lightly whip the cream and fold gently into the ricotta, then stir in half the pistachio sugar.Open each bun and fill with some of the ricotta, then the fruit.

It was disappointing but locals felt aggrieved at all tickets having to be purchased by credit card via Fifa’s approved website. With no option to purchase seats from the stadium box office it is perhaps no surprise so many stayed away.The Stade de Nice lies close to the Var river and it did not take long for its football namesake to be involved in controversy. When Fran Kirby whipped in a cross it hit Nicola Docherty on an outstretched arm.There was no sign of intent, no hint of hand to ball, and it was hard to see how the Scotland left-back could have avoided it hitting her but under the new “zero tolerance” rules it probably was a penalty. Indeed the referee, Jana Adamkova of the Czech Republic, was informed by the VAR official talking in her earpiece that she had missed a clear spot-kick and, having taken time out to view replays, Adamkova duly awarded it.Parris doubtless impressed her new public at Lyon by stepping forward to beat Lee Alexander from 12 yards, lashing the ball into the top corner, but for those used to the pre-VAR world it was hard not to conclude that the law was an ass. Significantly no England player or coach had appealed for the penalty.The Lionesses were infinitely the better side though and would have scored uncontroversially had Kirby not shot narrowly wide or Alexander not reacted smartly to save with an outstretched leg after Bronze’s swashbuckling run and cross reduced Docherty to a nervous wreck before setting up a stellar White volley.White thought she had scored after being put through by Keira Walsh but had been marginally offside and that effort was, correctly, disallowed. No matter, doubt was permeating Scotland’s every move, something only exacerbated when Parris nutmegged poor Docherty.Kerr has built her team to attack but had opted for caution here. It left Scotland camped in their own half and failing to showcase the opponent de-stabilising skills of Kim Little, Erin Cuthbert et al. Deployed as a lone striker the gifted Cuthbert found herself largely isolated.In contrast Neville had urged his players to take calculated risks and as White scored their second goal it really did seem a case of fortune favouring the brave. It began with Kirby evading Rachel Corsie’s attentions by getting a toe to a loose ball which fell kindly for the well-positioned White. All that remained was for Parris’s replacement at Manchester City to expertly curl her shot beyond the helpless Alexander.Cuthbert was inches away from reducing the deficit after seizing on a rare concession of possession on Walsh’s part – tantalisingly her low shot rolled inches wide of an upright -Kerr found herself confronted by a sizeable problem. Her players were struggling to string two or three passes together and their attempts to change the narrative by hitting England with long balls looked extremely optimistic. Kerr’s challenge was to somehow get Arsenal’s Little in possession in central midfield but Scotland’s trouble was that they repeatedly appeared horribly exposed down the flanks.Neville’s marauding right-sided axis of new Lyon teammates Bronze and Parris proved particularly strong Kerr could have done with Caroline Weir drifting infield less and helping Docherty out much more.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, spotted strolling on the Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, had hoped to see Nice’s seafront turned into La Terasse du Tartan but, amid that balmy Cote d’Azur evening air, the Fifa rankings did not lie. Scotland looked like the team rated 20th in the world to England’s third.Early in the second half a wonderfully incisive first finish from Beth Mead eluded Alexander but Mead had connected with White’s cut-back and the latter had been offside.That reprieve made scant difference to Kerr’s demoralised players Docherty was, sensibly, replaced by Kirsty Smith after collecting a booking for clattering into Parris.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsCreditably refusing to fold, Scotland improved a little, winning their first corner in the 65th minute. A menacing in-swinger from Weir – who does take a mean dead ball – it momentarily threatened to wrong-foot a largely underemployed Karen Bardsley before ultimately coming to nothing.Despite conceding twice, Alexander had an excellent game, one second-half save, involving a one-handed ersion of White’s fierce volley, seems destined to linger in the memory.Not too long afterwards Bardsley was finally confounded. Unusually Steph Houghton turned briefly slapdash, gifting the ball to Lisa Evans. Her run cut through Neville’s tiring midfield like a jet through cloud before she picked out Emslie who delighted in lifting the ball, right footed into the roof of the net from eight yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acb9382721932a6a04c4acbab7e7a1f3939222b5/0_63_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126245f90d204ee9902450b6ac2b81d","title":"switzerland england nations league third place playoff match report","story":"On the face of it, this should have been cause for celebration. England have finished third at a major finals for the first time since the 1968 European Championships even if, for context, that was a tournament won by Italy who had claimed their semi-final on the toss of a coin and this, in truth, is an inaugural four-team jamboree crowbarred on to the end of a slog of a season.Then there is the national team’s new-found confidence at penalties, their conviction personified by Jordan Pickford first thumping his team’s fifth spot-kick beyond Yann Sommer – “It was a decent pen, wasn’t it?” he offered through a post-match grin –then saving Switzerland’s sixth, spat to his right by Josip Drmic. No England goalkeeper had ever previously taken a penalty in a competitive shoot-out and, even if tension had long since drained from the afternoon, here was the hero from the Spartak stadium last summer outdoing himself by excelling at both aspects of the drill.Having seen previous England teams succumb in their previous five attempts at what was once considered an unscientific lottery, Gareth Southgate’s side have now prevailed in successive shootouts. That is quite a turnaround. And yet, from the near disdain with which the manager and his players treated the bronze medals awaiting them back in the dressing-room – some were apparently unaware there had even been a medal on offer, and did not seem particularly keen to root them out once informed – to the constant reminders that all this was not enough, they departed for home on Sunday night frustrated.Progress has been made in the last year, but the Nations League was supposed to yield a first trophy. That thirst has not been quenched. Southgate admitted the days since the semi-final lost to the Netherlands had been difficult, the sense of deflation palpable. “They took some lifting, but the significant step we’ve taken is the level of disappointment that we leave here having not got to the final or won the trophy,” he said. “We played fine on Thursday but made ridiculous mistakes. It was important we responded with a high level of performance.”They duly outplayed the Swiss here, only for profligacy to undermine their display. Thankfully, they were far more ruthless from the penalty spot than from open play.This game should have been settled by half-time in normal time, so dominant had Southgate’s side been. Four times the woodwork had been left quivering and, inevitably given events late on against the Dutch, there would be a reversal of a goal award from a VAR to endure before the end. Encouragement was to be gleaned from the slick approach play, invariably stemming from Pickford’s short delivery to Eric Dier or one of his centre-halves as a springboard for a foray upfield.John Stones spent all afternoon looking on from the bench, with England as composed here against unambitious opposition as they had been panicked against the more feverish Dutch press. Joe Gomez, utterly unflappable, and Harry Maguire coped far more comfortably this time round.Trent Alexander-Arnold excelled down either flank, his delivery vicious to bypass the Swiss backline, to serve notice of his talent as England’s right-back for the foreseeable future. Yet, for all the collective’s interchanges and energy, incisive passes and clever runs, there was no goal to celebrate.Harry Kane, bursting beyond Manuel Akanji before conjuring a sublime first-time chip from an unkind angle, had struck the face of the crossbar within 100 seconds of the start. Raheem Sterling would smack a free-kick against the woodwork at the other end 115 minutes later. In between, the Manchester City winger scuffed a fine chance straight at Sommer, watched Dele Alli denied by the goalkeeper and head another fine chance over the bar, and saw Fabian Schär ert Danny Rose’s cross inadvertently on to his own post.When England did eventually force the ball home, the substitute Callum Wilson shovelling the rebound into the net after Dele had looped another header on to Sommer’s bar six minutes from the end of normal time, the VAR penalised the Bournemouth striker for a shove on Akanji in the buildup.That effectively condemned all those present to endure the additional half-hour, not least with the Swiss – one battered Granit Xhaka attempt aside – utterly becalmed with minds drifting to summer holidays. Pickford kept that shot out, and enjoyed his moment in the dregs of the campaign.His penalty had been dispatched with glee. “I’d never taken one before, other than a few back in my school days,” said the goalkeeper, who would have taken England’s seventh attempt against Colombia last summer had it been required. “So it was a bit more nerve-racking. But I’ve practised a lot in training in the last three weeks, relaxed, went through my routine, and stepped up. I trusted my ability and my ball-striking.” His punch of the air was a highlight of the afternoon, though England would have preferred something far more tangible to celebrate from their six-day stint in Portugal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684a99e0e427b4f2f64158f12a0f18b05ad008b1/0_80_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eabdb57817518ffe1210a23d543a371d","title":"england v scotland womens world cup 2019 live","story":"England got off to a winning start as they survived a second-half rally by Scotland to claim three points in their World Cup openerI’ll leave you with our reporter’s take on England’s World Cup win in their opening match against Scotland. Thanks for your emails. Bye. David Wall writes: “Did I watch a different game from the analysts on TV. I thought England were excellent, especially in the first half, and especially down both flanks. True they seemed to tire a bit in the second half, but I thought they were always in control even if not as dynamic as in the first half. Their finishing needs improving a bit, though credit to the Scottish ‘keeper.” England manager Phil Neville wasn’t very happy with the second half: I was pleased with the result. The first game is always the most important game. We set standards and we cannot drop below the standards otherwise we get second-half performances like that. We’ve got to be relentless now. We want to be here for 37 days. I’m the biggest problem. The standards start with me. I think at 2-0 in this heat, we thought it was going to be easy in the second half. It’s a lesson that every game in this World Cup is going to be difficult. The concern I had was that I wanted us to pass the ball and get control. We only did that with five minutes remaining.Scotland manager Shelley Kerr has this to say: Well, that was much tighter than Phil Neville would have liked. The Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander denied England time and again, giving her teammates the platform to get back in the game through Claire Emslie’s second-half goal. Much will be made of the VAR-awarded penalty that Nikita Parris scored in the first half but it was a penalty as far as I’m concerned. The result was a fair one. England could probably have played better and Neville will have much he would like his side to improve on but an opening win is an opening win. 90+4 min: Scotland have the ball on the left but as Beattie looks to play the ball into the box the referee blows the whistle. England are victorious. 90+3 min: England pop, pop, pop the ball around the chasing Scotland midfielders as they look to secure the three points by keeping Scotland off the ball. 90+2 min: Scott wastes a few seconds in the corner, using her strength to hold the ball. She finds Parris behind her, who races inside and tees up Stanway, whose right-footed shot curls just wide. 90+1 min: There’ll be four minutes of stoppage time. Can Scotland find an equaliser? 90 min: Abhijato Sensarma thinks three is the magic number: “There have been three matches played in the Women’s World Cup today. All have seen three goals scored in total. A penalty was scored in each match too, and three were scored in the entire day. They were more similar than one would realise!” It’s not over yet Abhijato, though England have a free-kick in Scotland’s half and are doing all they can to run the clock down. 88 min: Scotland are having loads of possession but they can’t get out of their own half. But then “Thump!” A long ball forwards breaks the England press and Scotland probe down the right, before conceding a throw deep in the England half. 87 min: Arnot is on for Murray, who appears to have picked up a knock. “This is a cracking game,” writes Paul Byatt. “In fact it’s another cracking game in this World Cup. The Brazil and Jamaica goalkeepers really did dispel the myth that women cant be good shot-stoppers, they were excellent. Re the England Band. It can only be good that they are absent. Everything about them screams corporate tosh of the highest level.” 85 min: England’s game management has been good since they conceded. They have kept possession diligently and given Scotland little opportunity to get out of their own half. 84 min: Alexander makes a smart take from a deep cross by Greenwood. She has been superb in goal, her saves have given Scotland the platform to get back in this game. 83 min: Neville takes Mead off and brings Stanway on as he tries to bring a little zen-like calm into England’s play. His side win a corner … and then another as Stanway’s first touch is to knock the ball of a Scotland defender and behind. 80 min: Houghton gave the ball away sloppily in the buildup to Scotland’s goal. It was a loose pass into midfield that Evans nicked away. She has caused Scotland so many problems in the past five minutes.Well, she made up for that wastefulness all right! Evans drives through the England midfield and prods a pass behind England’s defence to Emslie on the right edge of the box. She just nips in ahead of McManus and Greenwood and sidefoots high into the roof of the net from eight yards. Game on! 75 min: Lisa Evans prods a shot at goal after a bright attack down the left. And then moments later, Little pulls the strings and finds Evans on the left again. She takes a a touch and lofts a ball to the back post, where Emslie is free, but she wastes a good chance to find a teammate inside her and hooks a shot over the bar with a tired waft of her left leg. 74 min: Kerr replaces Howard with Chloe Arthur. She’s now withdrawn both full-backs, highlighting just how much they have had to do to counter England’s bright attacks down the flanks. 72 min: Carney is on for Mead. It’s Carney’s 141st England appearance, making her the second-most capped England player of all time behind Fara Williams, on 170. 70 min: It’s a deep corner by Greenwood that is headed back towards goal. White is alert and pounces, stretching to hook a shot past Alexander, but the Scotland goalkeeper stretches every sinew and makes a brilliantly athletic save. 69 min: Greenwood tries to shift the ball past Emslie and fire in a cross from the left, but the Scotland midfielder is alert and deflects the ball out for a corner. 68 min: “A hooter goes in the crowd and makes me realise another reason to enjoy this game – the England brass band are absent, presumably refused entry for reasons of musical talent, aesthetic style, and simple good sense,” writes Charles Antaki. “One of the French authorities’ best decisions of the competition so far.” 67 min: It’s another deep one, that causes England problems. The ball is only half cleared and Corsie slams a shot at goal that is blocked bravely. This is sustained pressure by Scotland. They need to make it tell. 66 min: Weir loops an inswinger towards the backpost, where Bardsley stretches to punch clear. Another corner! 65 min: Cuthbert has done a magnificent job on her own up front. At times she has held off two England defenders as she has tried to keep possession and give her midfielders a chance to support her. Not that they have been able to assist her as much as she’d like. A corner for Scotland. Their first! 64 min: Emslie tries to trick her way past Greenwood on the right wing, but the England defender forces her inside, where a left-footed cross is blocked. England clear. 62 min: Little is caught late by Mead, who stays on the floor after perhaps overstretching as she tried to nick possession off Scotland’s playmaker. In fact, it looks like cramp. She may run it off. 59 min: Little is starting to grow in influence, connecting the dots for Scotland and moving her side forward with some neat touches and clever passes. She finds Evans on the right, but her attempted cross is blocked after some diligent defending by Greenwood. 57 min: Scotland get numbers forwards at last and Emslie has their first shot at goal, a tame effort from the right that goes straight at Bardsley. But from small acorns etc and so on. 55 min: Bright can’t continue and is replaced by McManus. And for Scotland, Docherty, who has been tormented by Parris, is replaced by Smith. 53 min: England continue to dominate possession even while they are a player down. But then Houghton is caught in possession. Cuthbert, again, the player who nicks the ball and drives forwards. She looks up, though, and sees only one player in the box. Her cross is gathered comfortably by Bardsley.50 min: Bright is receiving treatment after landing awkwardly on a shoulder. She’s taken off temporarily. Bronze is covering at centre-back while Bright receives further assistance off the field. Can Scotland take advantage while they have an extra player? 48 min: Cuthbert is too strong for bright on the right, levering her bigger rival out of the way with great tenacity, before cutting inside but lacking support again. The ball is eventually worked backwards but England increase the pressure and bring the Scotland attack to a halt. 47 min: Docherty clatters in to Parris and is booked for her trouble. Parris might be minded to attack Docherty with even more vigour now. One more late tackle and it could be game over for the Scotland full-back. 46 min: England have the ball in the net within 30 seconds. White squares for Mead, who drills the ball home. But replays show White was a smidgin offside in the buildup. 45 min: England get us under way. Phil Neville will be content with what he has seen s far. Shelley Kerr will want her team to get more players up in support of Cuthbert. “I’m grateful for Matt Dony’s comments, but he is obviously still drunk from Madrid,” writes Simon McMahon. “How else would he write an email which juxtaposes the words ‘Scottish’ and ‘success’?” Erm, Andy Robertson?England deserve a two-goal lead. Parris’s penalty set them on their way and from thereonin England dominated. Parris and Bronze sprinkled a bit of stardust on their play on the right and pushed Scotland deeper into their own half. The move for White’s second goal originated on the right. Scotland need to deal with that threat before they can go forwards themselves. I’ll be back shortly. 45+2 min: Parris, who has been a constant menace, whips a ball in behind the Scotland defence that Corsie does well to toe away ahead of White. The corner is worked back to Walsh, who slams a shot at goal from 25 yards that flies over the bar. And that’s that for the first half. . 45+1 min: Weir lofts a cross in towards Cuthbert but it’s beyond her and rolls out for a goal-kick. 45 min: Mead whips an inviting ball in from the right that sails over Alexander to the back post, where Kirby tries to connect but Scotland scramble away. 41 min: Scotland have a chance to get back into the game straight away as Walsh is caught in possession. The ball is fed to Cuthbert, who drives a low shot past Bardsley in goal but also a foot wide of the far post. That was sloppy by England. Corsie fails to win a tackle with Kirby on the edge of the box and Scotland are punished, as White picks up possession, watched Alexander race from her line and bends the ball around her and into the left corner. A lovely finish and probably a fair reflection of England’s dominance. 36 min: It’s played short and then Alexander is fouled as Greenwood lofts in a cross towards Scott, who is adjudged to have been leaning on the Scotland goalkeeper. 35 min: Scotland roll their sleeves up and win the ball back on the left and from there they begin to build an attack. It’s an attack that fizzles out when Weir rolls a sloppy pass back into midfield that England pick off. Moments later, Scotland have a corner to defend.

Ronaldo v de Ligt is about even, I’d say. De Ligt has been quite rough and ready with him.Peep peep! Portugal have been the better team without creating any clear chances. The Netherlands have been neat, tidy and entirely sterile. See you in 10 minutes.45+1 min The corner is taken short, swung deep and headed over by Fonte. And that’s that.45 min Blind wins a corner for the Netherlands, their first of the match. It’s headed clear by Danilo and Portugal break promisingly. Eventually Semedo’s shot, which was going miles wide, deflects off van Dijk for another corner.42 min “Either the German commentator on ZDF doesn’t seem to deem the action worthy of commentary, or there’s a technical glitch, but he’s been silent for at least 10 minutes now,” says Michael Dear. “Given the appalling state of football commentary in this country, though, I’m just as happy to hear the crowd noise, the occasional sounds of players shouting instructions to each other, or the thud of feet hitting the ball.”Maybe it’s a protest against modern commentary, and specifically the inability of 99 per cent of commentators to even consider allowing a millisecond of dead air (sic).41 min Portugal continue to chase Nations League glory. Ronaldo beats Dumfries and de Ligt before shooting straight at Cillessen from distance.39 min “What a shame it is that Pepe isn’t fit to play in this final,” says JR in Illinois. “A real damn shame. It’s so sad that we are missing out on the opportunity to witness his delicate skill and unrivalled, impeccable sportsmanship. Terribly unfortunate, we are. Did I mention what a shame it is?” A bit of pantomime villainy is just what this game needs, for mine.38 min Make that five shots. Bernardo Silva shoves an inviting little pass back to Bruno Fernandes, who sweeps over the bar from inside the D.37 min Bernardo Silva plays a nice little pass to Bruno Fernandes, whose shot on the run from the edge of the area is deflected behind by van Dijk. Fernandes certainly isn’t shot shy I think that was his fourth of the half.35 min Ronaldo plays the ball back to Guedes, whose low shot from the edge of the area takes a deflection before van Dijk boots it away. Portugal have been much more threatening in attack.33 min Dumfries runs 50 yards down the right. He looks up at all the blue shirts waiting in the middle - and then he decides to play a short pass, the most abysmal pass I have seen in my entire life. I’m not even going to dignify it with a description.32 min Louis van Gaal must be loving this Netherlands performance.31 min For once, the stats are a perfect summary of the game. The Netherlands have had 60 per cent of the possession and no shots at goal. Portugal have had 40 per cent and six shots.30 min Bruno Fernandes, on the right, whacks an awkward, wobbling shot from distance that is palmed round by Cillessen. From the resulting short corner, Ronaldo flashes a header straight at the keeper, though he’d been flagged offside.28 min Ronaldo’s shot from the right of the box deflects wide off van Dijk. The resuling corner is swung towards Fonte, whose header from near the penalty spot is a bit tame and comfortably saved by Cillessen. That was a chance. In fact it hit his shoulder, which would explain why it looked so tame. While that was happening, de Ligt took one in the face from Dias. I think it was accidental.27 min “Hello Rob,” says Kári Tulinius. “Viasat, the station broadcasting the Nations League here in Finland, certainly doesn’t seem to care very much for the final. The entire game so far has been shown from a camera high in the stands behind the Dutch goal, showing pretty much the entire pitch at all times. It’s interesting to watch the game that way, but it’s hard to tell what goes on when the ball’s near the Portuguese goal.”It’s just like being there, sort of.25 min Wijnaldum is fouled 40 yards from goal by Guerreiro. Ordinarily I wouldn’t give such incident the time of day but I’m starting to feel guilty about the lack of regular updates. I swear to you: nothing is happening.21 min Portugal are having a good spell, their best of the match in terms of possession. It’s still not especially exciting, though, and the game really could do with a goal.19 min Ronaldo is flattened by de Ligt, not for the first time in the game. This is the bit where I tell you that de Ligt was four years old when Ronaldo made his Portugal debut.18 min “Mrs Dony and Master Dony are both in bed, I refuse to pay for Sky Sports (and goodness knows there’s nothing else on at the moment), and I’m currently on a diet, meaning I’m trying not to eat or drink anything unnecessary,” weeps Matt Dony. “So, my Sunday evening is being spent lying very soberly on the sofa watching a recording of the original Broadway production of Into The Woods. It’s come to this. No pressure, Rob, but if your MBM isn’t sufficiently entertaining, then I can’t guarantee I’ll see tomorrow. Might just disappear in a sad puddle of lower-middle-age (still south of 40!) ennui.”I could do something wacky if you’d like.17 min Fernandes plays a dreadful pass straight to Bergwijn, who charges at the heart of the Portugal defence from the halfway line. He gets to the edge of the area and tries to scurry past the last man Dias, who stays on his feet and makes a fine tackle.15 min Portugal are playing like the away side, as they did so successfully for much of Euro 2016. They are so well organised in defence, and thus far the Netherlands haven’t been able to get behind them.14 min “Great to see a Scottish market town getting a run out at right-back for the Netherlands tonight,” says Alan Walker of everyone’s new favourite defender, Denzel Dumfries.13 min We’re having a few technical problems apologies. You haven’t missed much, just a long-range shot from Fernandes that was comfortably saved by Cillessen.9 min Bruno Fernandes has a shot from 25 yards, and instantly wishes he hadn’t. 8 min The Netherlands are dominating possession, as expected, but so far it has all been in front of the Portugal defence.5 min “Impossible to see a shot of the Portuguese manager and not immediately think of Jack Straw,” says Charles Antaki. “Unfortunately.”Well, it was possible to do so, but it isn’t any longer. Thanks a lot.4 min A very long ball is driven towards Bernardo Silva, who takes it down beautifully on the chest before falling over just inside the area after a challenge from Blind and van Dijk. Portugal appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty. Van Dijk did put hands on Silva, but probably not enough for it to be a foul.3 min It looks like Portugal are playing 4-3-3, with Guedes on the left of the attack and Bernardo Silva on the right. Ronaldo has just given the referee a rollocking for not giving him a free-kick.2 min “I saw the Maradona movie today and I’ll confess I was disappointed,” says Gary Naylor. “The story is more one of addiction (and there’s a sense in which every addict’s story is the same story) and not so much the one of outrageous genius. What little football included, comprised footage shot close up with no sense of his peerless domination of space through technique, vision and personality.”I suppose you could argue the football has been done a million times already, but that does sound a bit disappointing.1 min Peep peep! Portugal, in red, kick off from left to right. The Netherlands are in their away strip. This polarised blue away shirt pays homage to the team’s classic 1988 changed colours, while a deep royal blue geometric pattern celebrates ‘Total Football’—the pioneering style of play which earned them reverential status in the ‘70s.There’s a wonderful atmosphere in Porto this feels like a Proper Game. Cristiano Ronaldo and the rest of the Portugal team are belting out the national anthem as if the match depends on it.“Ronaldo will score and Portugal will win 2-1,” says Mayokun Mesole. “He’s been doing this for years tonight will not be different.”There isn’t a particle of my being that will be surprised if that does happen. Amazing to think that once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, he was seen by many as a big-game bottler.It’s a diamond midfield. I can’t type 4-1-2-1-2 I get too many Full Metal Jacket flashbacks. It’s a question that philosophers will ponder until the end of time: what does it all mean? Why, truly, have we all been received the gift of the Nations League? I’ve no idea how much this inaugural Nations League final between Portugal and the Netherlands matters to those involved, or where it registers on the gloryometer, and that feels a little strange.We know it won’t mean as much to the winners as Euro 2016 and Euro 88 respectively, but the evidence of the semi-finals are that it matters more than we thought it would when the idea was conceived. Winning it would certainly mean more to Portugal than the SkyDome Cup. Whichever side lifts the trophy tonight, it will be a good story. Portugal could win as hosts, something they failed to do at Euro 2004, and Cristiano Ronaldo could add to his already ludicrous list of honours. How many Nations Leagues have you won, “Lionel”?If the Netherlands win, it will be a neat way to erase their lost years after the 2014 World Cup, and could act as an Anglo-Scottish Cup for a young team that have captured the imagination as only a Dutch side can. We will also get to watch, among others, Joao Felix, Bernardo Silva, Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. I’m not sure what it means, but I do know there are worse ways to spend a Sunday night.Kick off is at 7.45pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4028495d358438ec98194e78d2292a0c9ae68289/30_0_880_528/master/880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4377579f3e28ad38e558d4a0e59e3fd9","title":"e3 2019 liveblog all the news from microsofts xbox conference","story":"Join the ’s video games editor Keza MacDonald and correspondent Keith Stuart for live news from the Xbox E3 2019 press conference: will we see a new console?Now: let’s talk about what Microsoft has to show.

But it’s only now, with 55 films under her belt and as Big Little Lies returns to our screens, that she really feels free to ‘try anything’To hear her mother tell it, it’s a miracle that Laura Dern exists at all. In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned. The trauma was not just emotional but physical, and doctors told her that she would be unable have another child. But they were wrong, and the proof was Dern. One confounded doctor travelled to the hospital to witness “the miracle child”. From her home in Ojai, California, Ladd’s smoky southern voice over the phone ripples gently with emotion as she talks to me about her daughter.The miracle child, now 52, grew up to be a great actor in her own right, sometimes even appearing alongside her mother. In 1991, Princess Diana was so taken by the idea that a real-life mother and daughter could play alternative versions of themselves on screen that she flew them both to London for a royal premiere of their garlanded film, Rambling Rose. Ladd recalls “pouring sweat” as she sat next to the princess. Dern was struck by the ways in which her host connected to her character. “She was empathy in cellular form.”A menu arrives, and Dern, who has been up since 5am nods enthusiastically at the suggestion of a strawberry tart. “A little sugar sounds amazing,” she says. The hotel is designed in the style of an English country home and Dern would like to know when we might get to talk about her love of London. “When I’m there I get to have Monmouth Coffee, the park, and the actor Andrew Garfield,” she says as if these three items were on everyone’s British bucket list. “What more do you need?” Why Garfield? “He’s a great, deep soul.” If Dern’s exuberance is a mask, she wears it very well. “It’s not ‘me’ to be a mystery,” she says, and then revises the thought. “Well, maybe I’m a mystery to a few boys in my life, but that’s good, that’s OK.”A night earlier, she had attended a screening of Trial by Fire, based on the real-life story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in Texas in 2004 for a crime he very likely did not commit. It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection. A woman in the audience had turned to a friend and joked about needing a Valium to get through it.Long before they met in person, Dern (who plays activist Elizabeth Gilbert), had taken to writing long, intimate letters to Jack O’Connell (who plays Willingham) as a way to draw closer to Gilbert’s experience. “I reached out and said, ‘May we correspond by letter?’ and we did that very intimately, very deeply – we shared personal history and secrets.” For Dern, Gilbert’s letters were “empathy in action”. “Anyone can make a small gesture of kindness to another person that can effect change in the world, it’s that simple,” she says.Empathy is a favourite word of Dern’s – shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem. In conversation, she seems to be looking for points of convergence and connection, in place of the usual wariness between the journalist and subject. Trump’s demonisation of Hollywood and the media have brought us together, she says. “How do we get the word out about what truth looks like, or what people are doing, or injustice, or what it is to be human and complicated?”The letters with O’Connell were also a kind of key Dern used to unlock her character. There is always a key. To prepare for Renata Klein, the clench-jawed control freak she plays on the runaway hit TV series, Big Little Lies, Dern interviewed female leaders in tech to help figure out her character’s motivation. In 2018, she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, one of four the series took home that year. “Renata is fierce and complicated and a nightmare, and also just wants a girlfriend and deserves to be seen because she’s lived in a man’s world her whole life,” she explains. “And what it takes for a woman in tech, a woman in banking, a woman in publishing – who you have to be and what you have to walk through to get the one seat in that boardroom of 13…”As on the show, the misogyny isn’t exclusive to men. One CEO of a major Silicon Valley startup confided in Dern how crushed she felt after a mother sent her a photo of her son playing soccer with a note that read, “Here’s a picture of your kid, I know you’re too busy to come to the games usually.” Dern throws her hands up in a gesture of exasperation. “She said, ‘I am a mom trying to show up and the people that shame me about being a working mother are the other moms.’” Dern would hear the same story in different variations over and again. Big Little Lies is about what men do to women, but it’s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves.Season one of Big Little Lies was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit. The who was the thread that kept audiences guessing until the finale. What can we expect for an encore? “They’re allowed to feel everything now, while also being watched,” says Dern. “What’s cool is that we are no longer servicing a whodunit plot, so the plot can be entrenched in the volcano of emotion we’re all feeling.” For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York’s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. “I did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,” she recalls. “She said, ‘Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?’” At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal orce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with Marianne Williamson, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president.Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. “I was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,” Dern remembers. “But once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren’t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.”She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, about a girl punk band. “A boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, ‘I know the kind of girl you are.’ And I’m like, ‘The kind of girl I am?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, you know, there’s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.’” Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. “We were both equally crushed,” she says. “It was like someone branded us.” Dern internalised the boy’s comment. “I was left feeling like if I didn’t lead with sexuality I wasn’t enough, that if I didn’t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I’d failed,” she says. “And yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.”It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in Blue Velvet and then some years later in Wild at Heart, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. “Wild at Heart is so interesting because I’m all of it,” says Dern. “I’m the girl he picks, and she’s sexual and wild, and it’s all about mess and insanity, but it’s a gift when you can be all of it.”Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children – Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple orced in 2012) – taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. “Suddenly my son is 17, and I’m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.” The actor smiles glumly. “As a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.” Meanwhile, Dern’s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. “I love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren’t necessarily on the page.”She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. “That generation doesn’t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, ‘branded’,” she says. “Boy, we were all raised so differently.” It’s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she’s living her best life and mean it.“What comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,” she says. “Now I feel like I’m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there’s just a longing to explore more, e deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.”Big Little Lies starts on Sky Atlantic at 2am tomorrow morning, repeated at 9pm, exclusively on Sky Atlantic \u0026amp Now TV, courtesy of HBOLaura Dern’s styling by Mary Inacio from The Wall Group hair by Paul Norton at traceymattingly using IGK makeup by Jo Strettell at traceymattingly using Serucell Skincare"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4da682cfe55b763ab9c199fa7509b5387555603/0_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7533395ab325f88712ecf61d203136","title":"app creep and the dark side of sharing private date on our phones","story":"Most of us happily upload the most personal information on to the apps we use everyday. But do we really want to share our data with organisations funded by anti-abortion campaigners?Updating a mental list of what our phones have become today includes, but is not limited to, high street, museum, magazine, therapist, nightclub, funhouse mirror, personal trainer and abusive partner. A chilling recent addition is “crisis pregnancy centre”.Truth is malleable for organisations funded by anti-abortion campaigners, and they continue to insert themselves into women’s lives uninvited, like wasps at a picnic. Sometimes they are clear about their intentions, like those who continue to “protest” outside UK clinics and film the people entering, after Sajid Javid rejected a call to create protective buffer zones around abortion clinics. And sometimes they crawl in under the door, as has been the case with the fertility app Femm, revealed last week to be bankrolled by a hedge-funder who campaigns against abortion and birth control.To the hundreds of thousands of women who have downloaded this app and might, therefore, now be wondering when their next period is due, or indeed if: the call is not just coming from inside the house, the call is coming from inside the phone. This is the latest reminder that, despite their chatty tone, and their grateful acceptance of more than 100 million women’s monthly details of headaches, sex lives and menstrual flows, fertility-tracking apps are not our friends.Apps have become the places where we bury all our secrets. The parts of our bodies we want to inflate, the ones we want to shrink, the age range of people we want to meet and where, and the types of sex we want to have with them and how, our legal history, the value of houses we can afford, the celebrities we spy on, the steps we have walked, how long we have slept and for what proportion of that time we snored. But the secrets don’t remain buried for long – the secrets are seeds, and they sprout, appearing again as targeted ads for kitchens and razors and ovulation tests.Of 24 health apps in a recent BMJ study, 19 shared user data with companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, despite developers regularly claiming they did not collect personally identifiable information. In January, Bloomberg Businessweek reported fertility apps had raised at least $350m since they launched, in part through their use of the intimate data they collect – data we hand over with a casual click, despite the fact that apps don’t have to meet the privacy standards of hospitals. And despite the fact they don’t always get it right. Fertility awareness, promoted on tracking apps, is considered the least effective method of birth control, resulting in around 24 pregnancies for every 100 women a year. It makes such cruel sense that a pro-life organisation should choose to weaponise them.App-creep is something most people have wondered about, whether halfway through their third night of insomnia and suddenly drowning in mattress ads, or having discussed their dying pot plants with an auntie, only to then get aggressively marketed ads from succulent sellers. Are our phones listening to us? Mark Zuckerberg says no. Is the truth, then, simply that we are as predictable as water? That a person your age, friends with your friends, logging into the WiFi at B\u0026ampQ and spending £3 on a coffee, is likely to be in the market for an entry level cactus? Is the truth that we give information loosely and freely, combing over the bald patch of suspicion that it may, at any time, be used against us? I’m not sure which is more scary.But, silver lining (well, silver-plated – it tarnishes with use), the Femm revelation is a good lesson in modern life. Like so many of our daily contemporary compromises, “what we pay in order to get something for free” is a lesson everybody needs to be educated in. An education that must be revised with every phone update. Children learn the names of every dinosaur by the time they’re three, and how to customise their Snapchat emojis by the time they’re 13. However opaque the technical details of what our phones are taking from us, surely we should have the capacity to learn the implications of clicking “agree”, so that when we choose to buy a phone, we don’t get owned ourselves.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11271fbd8a4876d1affdec73ae70d8e234d0b8e2/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=87ab7120845c21955fc7bca7ab867e7e 1760w","title":"flight airline travel rail family environment","story":"Campaigners want us to take fewer flights, but ditching the plane for a train is easier said than doneWhen 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg arrived in London as part of her awareness tour in April, the way she travelled was part of her message. After leaving her home in Stockholm, she went to Strasbourg and then Rome before going to the UK, all by train.The journey was part of the flygskam, or “flight-shaming”, movement, which encourages the feeling of being embarrassed or ashamed to take the plane because of the environmental impact.Thunberg has not flown since 2015 and is urging others to turn their backs on aviation for good.But for families planning a summer holiday, just how practical and cost-effective is it to shun air travel? Leaving aside the obvious concerns of dragging young children across the continent for many multiples of the hours it takes to fly to traditional holiday destinations – let alone further afield – there are questions over how many bags can be taken, comfort, and the possibility of industrial action, technical problems or delays. Those in favour of avoiding airports would argue that the same things can occur when going by plane.So is more ethical travel a realistic possibility for families?As a mother of four children aged from two to 11, Helen Hamston illustrates the views of many parents when she says the thought of a long-haul train journey in Europe fills her with horror.“Being confined in a carriage with members of the public where my kids are on show would be highly stressful. My toddler doesn’t sit still for long, and how many snacks would I need to pack for that length of journey? Changing trains would be like a military operation and when everyone is tired and hungry it just doesn’t sound like much fun. At least a flight is over more quickly,” says Hamston, who runs Mummy’s Gin Fund, an online advice forum and buy-and-sell platform for parents.It is a thought that will draw sympathy from many, and highlights the logistical problem of moving a young family from one destination to the next by rail. Hamston, who lives in Devon, says that for families with older children cross-country train journeys could be a great experience, but for now she is sticking with staycations.With baggage charges, the cost of getting to and from an airport and inflated food costs along the way, even the most budget of flights can balloon in cost quickly.There may be an expectation that, because of the amount of time it takes to get to your destination, rail, road and ferry would automatically be cheaper.The reality is not so clear-cut – particularly if you have to travel at peak times within the confines of school holidays.As a general rule the earlier you book – for most modes of travel – the cheaper the deal. Rail, ferry and airline companies use dynamic pricing, so shopping around in advance will usually pay off.Being flexible on travel dates will also help. Fridays and weekends are notoriously busy days for rail travel, for example, so passengers will usually pay more compared with midweek tickets. A search conducted recently for a return trip from London to Bordeaux for a family of four at the end of July (travelling midweek) would cost about £500 by train (Eurostar and TGV) or around £400 to fly with a low-cost airline, including check-in bags.While the train takes around six and a half hours, the flight is one hour 45 minutes. The return ferry crossing came in at £162 – a relative bargain, but petrol costs and probably an overnight stop would need to be included in the budget, not to mention the extra time taken.For longer journeys, the cost of travelling by train or car can increase significantly.The push towards more ethical travel has brought results. An increasing number of people are becoming more concerned with how they travel, says Lucy Bishop from Manchester-based Travel Counsellors.This extends from the destinations they choose to using local businesses when abroad. However, she has yet to see a considerable shift away from flying, she adds.“For most families it comes down to the time constraints,” says Bishop. “But also cost and practicality mean they have to fly if they want to go abroad.“A long train journey or road trip can be appealing for couples and singletons. They often view it as part of the holiday, making interesting stops en route. But travelling by train to popular family destinations, such as Greece, southern Spain and Portugal, just isn’t realistic if you have a big family and you’ve only got 10 days or two weeks.”Yet with growing pressure and heightened concern around global heating – plus potentially higher taxes in future on flights, to counter carbon emissions, and the social effect of “flight shaming” – it is possible there will be a more substantial shift in the coming years in the way holidaymakers travel.Muna Suleiman, campaigns officer at Friends of the Earth, urges families to be braver about their summer holiday plans and to ditch air travel.“Take action to cut pollution by thinking twice before hopping on a plane for your holiday,” she says. “You might be surprised how many beautiful parts of the world you can reach by train and how relaxing the journey can be – even with children.”Rail and road travel by the British on the continent is not a new trend – families have been taking the car to France, Germany, even Italy and northern Spain for years and Europe’s railway networks are a perennial favourite with gap-year students.Making the most out of potential savings for rail travel involves planning ahead. Being able to buy tickets in advance online has made things much easier, more transparent and cheaper.Mark Smith, founder of the train-travel website Seat61, provides tips on travelling by rail overseas. They include the rules on child fares in different countries and many of the ticketing pitfalls to look out for, such as how some booking websites don’t apply discounts on child fares so they can end up costing more than the adult ticket.Tickets are typically released between 60 and 90 days ahead of travel. If a family can be flexible with dates, try different options such as days of the week and times of the day, as ticket cost can vary widely.Smith recommends bargains such as Deutsche Bahn’s “Sparpreis London” fares from London to anywhere in Germany starting from €59.90 each way and Czech Railways, which offers Brussels to Prague fares from just €21.Elisa Vertue, 41, lives in south-east London with husband James Wilson, 43, and children Maia, five, and Rudy, four, but is originally from Milan and takes regular trips home.The family travel back to Italy at least twice a year, sometimes flying and at other times taking their motorhome. But Elisa and James, who run their own IT support business, say they are increasingly thinking about the impact on the environment.In July this year the family is going to northern Croatia to meet Elisa’s sister and her family for a three-week holiday. Elisa had looked into flying and the price was reasonable for the short hop to Europe, but instead the family has decided to take their motorhome and will make two stops in Europe on both legs of the journey.“When I thought about it, I didn’t want to fly,” says Elisa. “If we take the motorhome there will be less carbon emissions. We can also make the journey fun for the children. They will see a lot more of Europe as we will make stops in France and Austria.“Elisa paid £123 for the Dover to Calais ferry crossing and £145 for the Eurotunnel on the return journey. The faster Eurotunnel train is her preferred option but it was fully booked on the outward date.Elisa estimates it will take between two and a half and three full tanks of petrol to drive the 17 hours to Vrsar in Croatia. This could cost more than £250 for the 2.8 litre turbocharged motorhome, but they won’t need to pay for hotels on the journey or once they arrive.“As a total holiday package, taking the motorhome works out cheaper as we won’t have accommodation costs once we get to Croatia,” says Elisa. “But our carbon footprint should also be lower as we’ve chosen not to fly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e86c973c29b8dddf24eeea904c0c643600fd73dc/0_494_5551_3331/master/5551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00240648fbb31f7c38cd5cb4c4390e8b","title":"hot chip bath full of ecstasy interview","story":"On the eve of their seventh album, the best British pop act of their generation talk about two decades of music-makingA quiet Friday afternoon by London’s Regent’s Canal. Two dads who have known each other since they were 11 – they’re now 39 – are having lunch without the kids. One is a smiling, broad-shouldered bear in a pink T-shirt. The other is smaller and bespectacled, hiding under a baseball cap. They look slightly hipsterish, but blend into the background seamlessly. A huge yellow bag and rucksack under the table contain their rather different outfits for later that day.Five hours later, Alexis Taylor is in front of thousands at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park, Hackney, his cap removed to reveal rainbow-coloured hair, a DayGlo lifejacket with holes around the nipples swaddling his body. Joe Goddard, meanwhile, is rocking back and forth behind a bank of synthesisers, wearing a colourful jacket with a pattern by artist Jeremy Deller (also unfolded from the dad bags). Joining them are the rest of their crazily dressed band: guitarist Al Doyle in a linen tunic and trousers like a latterday apostle, brightly clothed multi-instrumentalist Owen Clarke, and synthesiser player Felix Martin smiling under his mop of madcap curls. Rob Smoughton (bass, congas, silvery beard, straw boater) and Leo Taylor (drums, lime-green top with pagan symbols) complete the live line-up.Behold Hot Chip, the greatest British group of their generation. They look like cartoon characters, and for their devoted fanbase, that’s where their appeal begins. The band’s music and image suggests a poppier, ravier version of Talking Heads. Gloriously ordinary weirdos, essentially, projecting their most extravagant selves on stage and video. Their fashion is the 21st-century equivalent of the Pet Shop Boys’ Japanese jackets and Boy caps, and they have an art-school archness that is easy to appreciate, as their songs are never too serious, their live sets infused with humour.Their best songs, from 2006’s Boy from School to 2010’s One Life Stand to their stunning new single, Melody of Love, undercut playfulness with a heart-tugging melancholy. Taylor’s voice – a high, pure peal in the tradition of Paul Heaton, Neil Tennant and Belle and Sebastian’s Stuart Murdoch – is the heart, while Goddard’s electronic wizardry provides their guts and pulse. Hot Chip are a strange modern success story: they’ve become festival headliners while only ever having three top 40 hits. Since 2006’s The Warning, their breakthrough second album, tracks such as Over and Over (with its earwormy refrain: “like a monkey with a miniature cymbal”) have become ingrained in our pop consciousness, boosted by regular TV and soundtrack deals. Hot Chip’s reputation as a brilliant live band has also helped, their music uniting old ravers and young (their top billing slot at 2015’s Green Man was glorious this year they headline Glastonbury’s Park stage and the electronic Bluedot festival).And they only get better. On 21 June, they will release their best, most commercial album yet: the provocatively titled A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The summer solstice release date is no coincidence: the typographic design and psychedelic colours of the cover art by Jeremy Deller and graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge (adapted into the band’s stagewear by Cardiff designer Demi Amber) suggests pagan rituals and the early days of rave. It’s all a long way from the south London schoolyard where Taylor and Goddard first met in 1991...“The first pop culture we bonded over? Honestly? Football and WWF wrestling!”Joe Goddard is great company: funny, interested, polite. Taylor is much quieter, but curiosity and warmth bubble through his conversation. The boys met at the now famous “pop comp”, Putney’s Elliott school, whose other notable alumni include Burial, the xx and Four Tet’s Kieran Hebden, one of their early mentors (Goddard once got Hebden’s university email disabled after sending him “enormous sound files”). The friends’ first musical bonding moment was Beastie Boys, whom they watched on The Word (“they were incredibly charismatic and silly and fantastical, and that’s what we wanted to be”). Later, they got into alternative American singer-songwriters such as Smog’s Bill Callahan, Jim O’Rourke and Will Oldham, who remains a big influence on Taylor. “He’s so interesting and contrary, a great lyricist, and so prolific. It’s funny: the music industry these days almost trains people to offer less stuff. I like challenging that.”Their interest in pop culture was helped by their parents being arty, curious types. Taylor’s father was a university English professor, his Greek mum a psychoanalyst (they orced when he was young). Goddard’s father was a film editor in Soho, which fascinated Joe, and Hot Chip’s adventurous videos, such as the recent eight-minute short film for Hungry Child in which a couple get possessed by the song, suggest a continuing interest. Goddard’s parents would throw open their basement to their son’s friends, including Clarke, on weekends, and after playing football on nearby fields, they’d convene to learn songs, play guitars and use “really rubbish, rudimentary” computer programs to take loops off CDs.Then, in 1999, the pair went to university – Taylor to Cambridge to study English, Goddard to Oxford to study history – but their resolve to make music together set in. “Everything was changing quite quickly at that point,” Taylor says. “Joe was getting into house and UK garage, I was listening constantly to Destiny’s Child, but we still travelled to be together often and started trying to do our own weird take on the music that we liked.”Hot Chip’s first EP, Mexico, was released in 2001, “outselling Eric Clapton’s new release in Cambridge’s Parrot Records on the day it came out,” Taylor says, proudly. Another EP, Sanfrandisco, followed in October 2002, after the friends had graduated. By this point, Goddard was a marketing assistant at Island Records (“I worked on the first Keane album!”), and soon after heard the EP playing in the office of A\u0026ampR Stephen Bass, who also ran indie label Moshi Moshi. In 2004, Bass released their first album, Coming on Strong.By the time of its follow-up, The Warning, Hot Chip had signed to EMI and were everywhere: popping up on TV background tracks, getting a Mercury nomination and being sent on huge tours. “We were a sales priority! Not that that lasted,” says Goddard. “We went on this semi-amazing, semi-crazy trip across Spain and Portugal, being shipped from festival to festival in this coach in boiling heat – but the air conditioning was broken. We were all, ‘Yeah, we’re the new music business thing, guys!”2008’s Ready for the Floor remains their only Top 10 single (No 6). “I loved that moment,” Taylor says. Does he mind not having had any more? “It’d be nice, but it’s not that I’m studying the charts, desperate to get in.” He laughs. “It’s hard to talk about this without sounding ancient and miserable but the best pop, in my mind, is imaginative, immediate and accessible – but also challenging. I hate the amount of bland pop music around now. In our early days, Timbaland and Neptunes were producing big hits in really interesting ways. There’s hardly anybody doing that now.”After EMI collapsed in 2012, Hot Chip left the majors to sign to Domino, a label where Taylor had worked in his university holidays, doing admin. “They let us be who we want to be, and do what we want to do,” he says. This has included them doing lots of extracurricular music in the last decade: Taylor’s jazz improv four-piece, About Group, and his and Goddard’s solo albums have come out on the label too. Taylor was also one of the first signatories on the letter to save Radio 3’s experimental programme Late Junction earlier this year. “An institution like that having platforms for interesting, erse music is really important,” he continues, “whether it’s Late Junction, Later With Jools Holland, or the Maida Vale sessions. It underlines that creativity is worth paying attention to.”The spirit of collaboration with others has changed them, they say – and it’s the same for Al Doyle, who joined LCD Soundsystem live in 2007, before co-writing seven tracks on their 2017 album, American Dream (“Al’s in James Murphy’s classy world now,” Goddard smiles).Taylor’s 2017 Listen With(out) Piano project also saw him giving songs over completely to other people to finish, among them Green Gartside and Royal Trux’s Jennifer Herrema. When Hot Chip came back together, he knew a similar approach would enliven them. So instead of producing themselves, as they always did, they got in Philippe Zdar, of French dance duo Cassius, who went wild on the psychedelic effects (“He’s got a bottle of acid in his fridge, actually,” Goddard says). Xx producer Rodaidh McDonald was harsher. He pushed them to rewrite lyrics and edit song ideas drastically. “We signed up for it, though, so that’s OK,” Taylor says. “And it’s thanks to him that Melody of Love is a big pop single rather than a 12-minute instrumental.”He loved that idea of “connecting to people”, he says. Live is equally meaningful for the band. “It’s important to me that we come to life on stage: being upbeat, not too subtle, and I love to see people’s reactions if that’s possible,” adds Taylor.But other things have changed Hot Chip’s approach to making music in recent years. One was having kids, which they did relatively young (Taylor was married in his early 20s and his daughter, Prudence, is 10 Goddard’s daughter, Edie, is eight, his son, Albert, seven). “Parenthood teaches you a lot about your ego,” says Goddard. “Having a sense of self-importance is crucial if you’re in a band – that your ideas are important and need to be sung to people. Having kids battles that, makes you focus, and also makes time much more precious, which is a really wonderful thing. You can’t have this wonderful spontaneous lifestyle of just being able to read the newspaper in a cafe for three hours on a Saturday morning any more. Instead, you’re rocking your daughter because she will cry if she’s put down, and you’re thinking of the bassline and the beat you’re going to work on. And when you do it, you make it special.”But tragic events have affected them too, several around the release of 2015’s Why Make Sense?. Schoolfriend and longtime collaborator Vincent Sipprell, a violinist, killed himself in January 2015 Taylor has said that the loss deeply influenced that record.Then, on 18 November, the band were due to play in Paris. Five days before, 90 people were killed at the Bataclan. The band had played there previously they knew people directly affected by friends dying. “We really didn’t want to do our gig if it seemed like the wrong message,” Goddard says. But they played, and Al Doyle read a statement at the start of the gig that he had written in French. “He said that it’s incredible how just playing a show becomes a political act after something like that happens. People thanked us for helping them to be able to be together as a group of people, enjoying something that they wanted to enjoy.” He sits quietly for a moment. “You could see from the stage people who were dancing but also in tears. It was an incredibly moving experience, to be honest.”With that in mind, A Bath Full of Ecstasy feels like a record for our terrifying times. It takes the communal spirit of house and splices it with the DNA of pop: music as a conduit of hope. The band’s image in 2019 – all sugary pastels and pure joy – is wrapped up in that feeling. We’ve moved to a photo studio next door by this point, where the Observer pictures are done and dusted in half an hour, Taylor and Goddard changing in and out of their candy boilersuits like pros.They find the world around them frightening: Goddard regularly retweets anti-Trump and climate change messages. But Taylor would never write direct protest songs. “Rather than just saying, ‘Oh, there’s Brexit and there’s Trump in power’, instead we’ll write songs like Positive, which is about looking for positivity – asking people to support those around them suffering from mental health problems or facing difficulty with poverty or homelessness. I’m thinking in songs instead, to try and figure out an answer.” Mindful escapism, perhaps?In a way, A Bath Full of Ecstasy began life as a Katy Perry project. She had asked for Taylor and Goddard’s services while making her 2017 album, Witness, and they spent four days in Air Studios together. “It was incredibly exciting,” says Goddard, giddily. “I loved writing for somebody else. She was great, very funny and easygoing, unlike the people around her. They’d text: ‘Katy’s coming in 20 minutes’, ‘Katy’s walking through the door’, ‘Katy’s standing in front of you.’” One of these songs, Into Me You See, made it on to Perry’s album two others, Spell and Echo, have been reworked by Hot Chip for theirs.Then came their own sessions – and that eyebrow-raising title. Surely it’s not a midlife crisis drug-taking record? Goddard admits that he’s been “microdosing on mushrooms a bit, which is a bit zeitgeisty”. Taylor revealed earlier this year in a Q interview that he has never taken ecstasy. “But that wasn’t meant to be a forceful thing. It wasn’t an anti-drugs message. I mean, I haven’t taken it.” He looks at Goddard. “But everybody else in the band has.” They both laugh.The title came from a line from a song they wrote early on, “and it was just the most evocative and interesting and fun that endured, and just a bit of a break from too serious a title. And I didn’t think it’s a problem to have a title that could be fun or playful or light-hearted in some ways. Ecstasy is just a nice thing to be talking about these days, isn’t it?” He stops. “I mean, the actual feeling of ecstasy.”“And trying to present a kind of positivity in this world also feels like a valid contribution,” Goddard says. “It’s a worthwhile thing to do.”It’s now 3.15pm and we’re standing outside a corner shop. Our Uber keeps getting cancelled. We hail a black cab in a hurry, piling in with the boys’ costume bags on our knees (this doesn’t happen to Katy Perry, I suggest). Goddard talks about the last time Hot Chip played Victoria Park in 2007. He had been DJing after a gig the previous night, finally falling asleep at 9am. He woke up at 5pm, just as the band were coming off stage. (Clarke had been with him too, although he made the last 20 minutes of the gig.) “I can still remember the dread,” Goddard shudders. Things are slightly different these days. Now he’s planning family camping trips across Europe around the band’s summer festivals.A few hours later, we’re backstage ahead of the gig. Primal Scream, Little Simz and Kate Tempest are Hot Chip’s neighbours. Among them is Hot Chip percussionist Rob Smoughton, who talks about the time Elton John invited all of Hot Chip backstage at a festival in California in 2015. “He was so knowledgeable about the band – he knew everything! – and was so bloody nice.”Then comes Owen Clarke, recoiling when I mention Goddard’s missed gig recollections (“oh God”), Felix Martin and the cheerful Al Doyle, who confirms his position as the “classiest” band member (Goddard’s description) by telling me about a party he went to at former  editor Alan Rusbridger’s house and by making me a G\u0026ampT from their rider. An hour later, he’s dressed in that tunic and wide trousers, joining his strange parade of bandmates to raise hell on the All Points East stage.The opening notes of Huarache Lights shimmer, and we’re off. The set is fantastic, old and young singing along like total converts. Taylor drags a Leffe bottle over his guitar strings and bursts into laughter during Ready for the Floor when a refreshed teenager wearing a silver bumbag shouts its chorus line back to him (“You’re my number one guy”).And then comes something absurd and completely brilliant: Hot Chip cover Beastie Boys’ Sabotage.

But when there are 11 of you, you sometimes have to shut up and get on with it.“And the idea that you can agree a strategy and then constantly question it, debate it – sometimes you have to say, can we just stop talking and do some frigging campaigning?”Heidi Allen, Change UK’s interim leader, also left on Tuesday. The others to leave and sit as independents were another ex-Conservative, Sarah Wollaston, and the former Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith.Those remaining with Soubry are Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey, all of whom formerly represented Labour.Soubry said she was particularly stricken by Umunna’s decision. “I will always be more sad than you can imagine that Chuka is not with us. I think he’s a man of huge ability and talents, and I think he has made a very serious mistake.“With the five of us, who knows what’s going to happen? But you can’t give up at the first hurdle. You just don’t. Especially when some of that was circumstances over which you had no control. But when there are circumstances over which you do have control you do not behave in the way that, I’m afraid, some of those six did behave.”But insiders say the disagreements were even more heated behind closed doors, punctuated by differences over leadership arrangements, threats to quit the party and lack of agreement over even the basics of the party’s future direction.Some of the reported disputes bordered on farce, such as the party almost missing a print deadline for its European election leaflets because one MP wanted a different photograph, and official social media feeds being stopped at the instructions of one member, and then tacitly resumed by another.Meanwhile, sources amid those who quit argue that Soubry and Leslie – whose spouses are respectively treasurer and chief executive of the party – sought to run Change UK “like a Soviet state”.Soubry says she will stay as leader until an autumn conference, and has ruled out any idea of joining up with the Lib Dems.The split was clear, Soubry said, when Umunna told her he did not think Change UK should continue as a formal party.“I said to him: the movement’s out there, we just need to build a home for that movement, a political party. When he decided that he believed we should not stand candidates I was beyond even disappointed,” she said.“I believed in him, and believed he should be prime minister of our country. He was a major part of why I left the Conservative party. And here we were, having had a very difficult time, and obviously a disappointing set of election results.“But hell, 600,000 people voted for us, and we’d found 69 candidates, many of whom have got more ability in their little fingers than some MPs across the whole of the chamber. Some seriously brilliant people.”The five remaining MPs were “absolutely on the same page”, she said. “We’ve got decades of experience between us. We’re now going to turn our attention on building a membership-based party, and of equal importance we’ve already started the work on formulating policies. That’s already begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a5c97fcf7840edecccef2949eceea1102da4575/0_93_2792_1675/master/2792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2c79646551202d3dc8a309c4105273c","title":"mike pompeo leaked recording corbyn labour jewish leaders","story":"US secretary of state made comments in recording leaked to Washington PostLabour has accused Donald Trump’s top official, Mike Pompeo, of trying to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, after he was caught on tape telling Jewish leaders that he would “push back” against the party’s leadership.In a recording leaked to the Washington Post, the US secretary of state was asked what he would do if Corbyn were to be elected as prime minister, after sustained criticism over Labour’s handling of accusations of antisemitism within the party.The questioner said: “Would you be willing to work with us to take on actions if life becomes very difficult for Jews in the UK?” In response, Pompeo appeared to suggest that he would seek to intervene in the debate before Corbyn had a chance to become prime minister.“It could be that Mr Corbyn manages to run the gauntlet and get elected,” he said on the recording. “It’s possible. You should know, we won’t wait for him to do those things to begin to push back. We will do our level best. It’s too risky and too important and too hard once it’s already happened.”A Labour spokesman said: “President Trump and his officials’ attempts to decide who will be Britain’s next prime minister are an entirely unacceptable interference in the UK’s democracy.” He added that the party was “fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and is implacably opposed to antisemitism in any form”.Pompeo’s comments emerged after Trump turned down Corbyn’s request for a meeting during his state visit to the UK last week, saying the leader was “somewhat of a negative force”. Corbyn joined protests outside Trump’s press conference with Theresa May, where he pledged to oppose the US president’s drive for greater access for US health companies to NHS contracts.The comments come at a time when Corbyn’s team are nervous about the latest attempts to oust him from within the party over the issues of antisemitism and Brexit, after several senior figures came out in support of a second referendum.Shadow cabinet sources said the leadership was preparing to take on Tom Watson and his supporters after his vocal campaign to soften Corbyn’s Brexit position, with moves under way to generate momentum in favour of a new deputy leadership election.There is growing talk about the possibility of the party’s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Watson, but also the possibility of a new deputy leadership contest altogether. Some Corbyn supporters are circulating motions against Watson around local constituency Labour parties and a grassroots petition against the deputy leader has got about 26,000 signatures so far.One shadow cabinet minister said they believed the leadership wanted to make the shadow cabinet less in favour of a second referendum. As part of this, Corbyn’s team considered swapping Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, with Diane Abbott, the home secretary, over her support for a second referendum and wider foreign policy issues.However, it is understood that Thornberry has more recently been assured that she will not be moved and that Abbott was opposed to such a plan anyway, which would make the move difficult to carry out without a public battle.A Labour source said there were no plans at all for a reshuffle and dismissed speculation about moves within the top team as mischief-making.Talk of a reshuffle was sparked when Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s usual stand-in for prime minister’s questions this week after speaking out about Labour’s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was “not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear”. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb218a5f2ad78f32487501945e27e73e1f59399/0_0_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797e85a203eb85d6d35491f9f9e37e08","title":"tory leadership contest where do things stand","story":"From their Brexit stances to their social media game, how are Johnson, Gove, Hunt et al getting on?Pitch: The leader to see off the other parties – robust on Brexit and electorally appealing.Stance on Brexit: Insistent the UK will leave on 31 October, whether or not there is a deal. He is officially committed to trying to renegotiate the deal with the EU, and using “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border.Key supporters: Aside from Gavin Williamson (who is helping coordinate the campaign) and Liz Truss, Johnson has won backers across the spectrum from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker on the hardline Eurosceptic wing to Johnny Mercer and Damian Collins on the more centrist side.Social media game: As with his entire campaign so far, quite low-key, although he did release a very glossy launch video.Chances of winning: Very good. Bookies have him as the odds-on favourite.Campaign so far: No disasters yet – which is precisely what Johnson needs.Pitch: Not Boris Johnson. The environment secretary is appealing to MPs as a reliable Brexiter who, unlike certain colleagues, always works hard and can focus on a brief.Stance on Brexit: Hard, but not overly hard. Gove has promised to go for no deal if needed, but has said he could countenance shifting the deadline a few weeks beyond 31 October if it meant a deal could happen.Domestic offer: He has also made a schools spending pledge, and more generous than Johnson – £1bn extra a year. He has also promised free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit.Key supporters: Some influential Tory centrists such as George Freeman, Nicky Morgan and Tom Tugendhat have signed up, as well as more Brexit-minded colleagues such as Bob Seely.Social media game: Professional if not overly exciting, although his campaign video won praise.Chances of winning: Currently the second favourite, albeit on relatively distant odds of about 61.Campaign so far: Slow and steady, not least in amassing a fair number of MP nominations. However, his policies have been overshadowed by accusations of hypocrisy after he admitted taking cocaine as a young journalist.Pitch: The competent moderate, who would still deliver Brexit but wouldn’t scare off middle-ground voters.Stance on Brexit: Try to renegotiate a departure deal with a new team involving the DUP and Eurosceptics. If this was not possible, Hunt could go for no deal, but has said this would be “political suicide” because it would bring a confidence vote and perhaps an election.Domestic offer: Nothing so far in the campaign, but last month he did argue for a doubling of the defence budget in the decade after Brexit.Key supporters: It has been a coup to be backed by cabinet Brexiter Liam Fox. The other 30-plus declared so far are generally centrists, and several are Foreign Office alumni.Social media game: Boringly corporate. His launch video took viewers back to the garage where Hunt set up his educational publishing company. This stressed his entrepreneurial spirit, even if Hunt’s claim that these early days involved “a daily grind to stay alive” raised eyebrows, coming from the son of an admiral.Chances of winning: Seems set in a battle with Gove to get the second place on the members’ ballot alongside Johnson. Currently around 71.Campaign so far: Solid. Credentials as a statesman were done no harm by a central role in Donald Trump’s visit.Pitch: The outsider with a moderniser’s zeal. Did he mention his father was a bus driver?Stance on Brexit: Relatively robust, intimating that he would aim for a 31 October departure, even on no deal. But has mocked the idea of proroguing parliament to ensure no deal as “complete nonsense”.Domestic offer: Unshackled from the wishes of Theresa May, the home secretary is opening up on immigration, saying he would scrap long-standing Tory net migration targets and make it easier for overseas students to stay on in the UK to work.Key supporters: Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader is a major coup, and he also has influential backbencher Robert Halfon and the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright. But is lagging behind the others in numbers.Social media game: Enthusiastic if mixed. His campaign launch video was a very basic piece to camera in an echoey parliament room, with the sound of the ubiquitous Westminster bridge bagpipe busker audible in the background.Chances of winning: Seems slim but his campaign has been boosted by Davidson’s endorsement. Bookies say it’s 331.Campaign so far: Underwhelming, but he can expect a very senior cabinet job in a new government.Pitch: Brexit? I’ll give you Brexit.Stance on Brexit: Positively militant. One of only two candidates to not only promise to push through a no-deal Brexit if needed, but to say they might prorogue parliament to stop MPs blocking this.Domestic offer: Raab has made the eye-catching if expensive pledge to cut income tax by 5p over the course of the next parliament, which some estimates say would cost about £25bn.Key supporters: Veteran Brexiter David Davis. Most of his backers are, as you’d expect, on the strongly Brexit side of the Tories.Social media game: Verging on the mediocre, but buoyed by “grassroots” Twitter feed #ReadyforRaab.Chances of winning: Not great now that Johnson has bagged many leading lights in the hardline European Research Group. Odds are above 201.Campaign so far: Underwhelming, but in part this is due to Johnson’s dominance on the pro-Brexit side of the draw. He has also courted controversy by sticking by his assertion that feminists are some of the “most obnoxious bigots” in the debate on equality.Pitch: Maverick, man of the people, fond of long walks.Stance on Brexit: Decidedly centrist. Wants a soft Brexit, perhaps involving a customs union. Rules out no deal.Domestic offer: You name it, he’ll think about it. Most eye-catching among the numerous ideas punted in tweets and videos is the idea of a compulsory national citizens’ service for young people.Key supporters: Ken Clarke and David Gauke. And, sadly for Stewart, only three more MPs are publicly backing him so far.Social media game: The clear winner on this score, for all the good it will do him in the end. Omnipresent, responsive, tireless, compulsively engaging with voters on mini-videos.Chance of winning: Odds of 251 possibly overstate the real likelihood, given the lack of Tory MPs backing him. But the attention could see a cabinet promotion.Campaign so far: A triumph, if persuading Twitter liberals is the intention. Remains to be seen how this translates to his fellow MPs.Matt Hancock: The heir to George Osborne, with a centrist message and 14 backers so far, but seems unlikely to overtake Gove or Hunt to become the moderate candidate put to members.Andrea Leadsom: The pro-leave ex-leader of the house is having another shot after dropping out of the contest last time around against Theresa May, but her Eurosceptic colleagues seem to be flocking to Gove and Johnson.Mark Harper: A former chief whip barely known by the public, Harper will be glad to get past the first round of voting.Esther McVey: The former work and pensions secretary is even more of a Brexit ultra than Raab, saying she wants to leave with no deal without even trying to renegotiate.Sam Gyimah: The remainers’ remainer in Tory terms. Quit government to seek a second referendum, but has yet to gain any public backers among MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84386169d3efa3af678cd777312c5862c8ddeb73/0_173_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4448e9fbf39cd01ca66b086c5e33dd3","title":"bath abbeys east wing reopens after floor restoration","story":"Work to stop slabs crashing into burial spaces beneath has uncovered a wealth of surprises A painstaking operation to stop the floor of one of the UK’s great churches caving into the burial spaces beneath the great stone slabs has reached an important stage.The east wing of Bath Abbey, which has been hidden behind hoardings for more than a year, was reopened for members of the congregation on Sunday and from Monday visitors will be able to tread the much more stable floor.Experts have lifted and restored hundreds of slabs, many of them ledger stones inscribed with the names of the people whose remainslie beneath.The structure has been made more solid and underfloor heating built in that will use the hot water from Bath’s famous springs to heat the building.The churchwarden, James Playfair, said the abbey was delighted with the renovated floor. “It’s noticeably flatter and there are lovely variations in colour. It used to be uniformly grey,” he said.Playfair said Bath’s popularity as a place to take the waters as a cure in the 17th and 18th centuries have led to the problems with the abbey’s floor. Not all of the ailing visitors were healed and thousands were buried underneath the church. Over the centuries voids have appeared beneath the floor, leading to subsidence.The “Footprint” project to restore the floor at a cost of almost £20m began in May 2018.There have been many challenges. The nature of the building means that very little machinery can be used. Stones have been lifted using block and tackle – and sheer human brute strength.Problems have included the unexpected unearthing of seven intact lead coffins. The contractors intended to bury them beneath the new floor structure – but as they dug deeper they came across the vividly coloured tiles of a 13th-century floor.The tiles offered a glimpse of what the interior of the grand Norman cathedral that once stood on the site would have looked like. The tiles were recorded before being covered by a protective membrane and sand and have been left hidden 2 metres under the floor.The discovery of the 13th-century floor meant that the coffins could not be reburied and they have been relocated to the abbey cemetery on the outskirts of Bath.However, there is more work to be done. The next phase of restoration involves repeating the process in the north side of the abbey and, finally, the south section will be sealed off and the floor lifted and restored. The scheme is due to be finished in 2021.Alix Gilmer, the project director of Footprint, said: “We are delighted that we are able to open up the east end of the church again. The wealth of discoveries that were found underneath the floor has been truly amazing and it really is incredible to see the restoration of the ledger stones. So much work has been carried out, but there is still a huge amount ahead as we move into phase two.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

They swept past South Africa and on Sunday they steamrollered Australia. They won by 36 runs but the margin was much closer than the contest, which felt, for most of the day, like it was only heading one way.India started it with a partnership of 127 between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan, and finished it, eight hours later, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking the final wicket with the last delivery. The only reason it wound up as tight as it did was because Australia fought a pigheaded rearguard in the second innings.They were overwhelmed on the field and off it, where their solitary knot of fans in the corner of the Peter May stand looked like a pinprick of sunshine in the midst of a wide blue sky of India supporters. At one point Virat Kohli even asked his supporters to go easy. They were booing Steve Smith when he was fielding at long-off, until Kohli broke off from his batting and started shouting at them to clap him instead.There was an uneasy moment, too, when Adam Zampa was caught on camera fiddling around with an object in his pocket while he was holding the ball. His captain, Aaron Finch, said later that Zampa was only using a handwarmer.Kohli’s kind gesture was the only mercy he showed. Ominously, it felt in the end, he and his team still had plenty left to give if they needed it, that they had not had to bowl or bat as well as they can.Their innings started slowly after Kohli won the toss. Dhawan and Sharma spent the opening overs settling in. Although, given Mitchell Starc was on at one end and Pat Cummins the other, they did not find it all that easy to get comfortable.Starc almost had Sharma in the second over but the ball burst through Nathan Coulter-Nile’s grasp at short mid-wicket. And then Starc cracked Dhawan on the left hand with a wicked delivery that spat like hot fat from just back of a length. Dhawan needed treatment and afterwards he was careful to play him from deeper back in his crease. He did not field either.After seven overs, India only had 22, then Finch brought on Coulter-Nile and the innings started to snowball. Dhawan clapped one four down the ground, whacked another through point, and slapped a third through third man.India had clearly decided that if they could just see off Starc and Cummins, then the rest of Australia’s attack would be easier to get at. Finch kept making changes, fiddling around with his two spinners and bringing back Starc and Cummins when he had to but Dhawan and Sharma pressed on, accelerating steadily, up to five, then six runs an over.Dhawan was doing most of the work. He was severe on Marcus Stoinis. He uppercut him over the wicketkeeper’s head and hit him for a preposterous inside-out cover drive at another. It was the 23rd over before Sharma sliced a loose drive and was caught behind. The ground fell silent but the lull did not last long because Kohli was next man in. It made for a smooth progression, although everything did seem to get a little nervous when Dhawan reached 99, the tension was increased by the heartbeat thump of all those Indian drums.He almost blew it, too. Stoinis was bowling, and Dhawan prodded the ball to mid-on. Kohli called him through but Dhawan hesitated and Kohli turned to e back to his crease as the throw came in. The ball ricocheted off the stumps and the batsmen ran the single after all but before they or anyone else could celebrate they had to wait for the TV replay to see whether Kohli was out. It was 37th over before Australia took another wicket, when Dhawan hoicked a catch to deep mid-wicket on 117.Soon after, India finally slipped into something near top gear. They promoted Hardik Pandya to No 4, and he blazed 48 off 27 balls. Even his dismissal only brought in MS Dhoni, who clobbered 27 off 14. Even Starc and Cummins could not do anything much to slow them down now. Kohli finished with 82 off 77.Facing an imposing total of 352, Australia decided to try to win it with the sort of batting tactics that were last in fashion when their coach, Justin Langer, was still playing.David Warner played another bizarre innings of 56 from 84 balls before he was caught at deep midwicket. He is batting in shackles at the moment. Finch went well, but then he was run out hesitating over a second that Warner called for, which did not help.Smith fared better but still was not able to score any quicker than a run a ball before he was given out lbw to Kumar for 69. Australia still needed 115 and there were only 10 overs to go. Glenn Maxwell (28 off 14 balls) and Alex Carey (55 off 35) finally started batting with some urgency but it was too little, too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87bff1c38e6c15f7880cfd126e7daba22c08119e/0_53_2340_1403/master/2340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a95c38d5227b83ae1a8ef83c16699e57","title":"cricket world cup 2019 india v australia live","story":"Shikhar Dhawan’s fine century put India on course for a huge total which left Australia with far too much to doAnd check out the latest standings, which show India are now up to third …That’s all from The Oval.

After losing that series in India we had a point to prove. We came here with intent from ball one when we were batting. The opening partnership was outstanding. It was absolutely the perfect game for us and with the ball it was an absolutely brilliant start. We were very professional and that always pleases me as a captain.” Enjoyed Pandya’s hitting, MSD at the end. “We played the way we wanted to play.” Aaron Finch speaks. “They got 120 in the final ten over, which is a lot. We didn’t bowl out best stuff. We struggled to get wickets early on, that was the key. With experienced guys they had coming in, it made it tough. I think being a used surface didn’t help with the new ball there wasn’t a lot on offer earlier. But we could have been more back of a length early. But they bat very deep. They just outplayed us.” He also backed in David Warner. We’ll be back with the captains in a sec. Kohli and Finch are making their way to the middle for the presentation.

We are a great fielding side as well. We have a very balanced side with fast bowlers and spinners. I am happy to be part of it. We work really hard in the nets and that is why it is going our way as well.”Never in doubt. Australia finish with a healthy 316 but they never were really in the chase, aside from about 10 minutes when Maxwell and Smith were together. The Australians didn’t go hard enough early. Or perhaps better put: India bowled so well, they couldn’t get away. Warner faced 48 dot balls in his innings of 56, for instance. Bumrah and Bhuvi, then Chahal especially, were just too good. Smith (69), Khawaja (42) and Maxwell (28) all had moments - and Carey (55 not out) was excellent at the end - but the task was too great. India worthy winners.There it is! Zampa spoons the final ball of the innings to extra cover, giving Bhuvi a well-earned third wicket. A fantastic performance from the men in blue.Bhuvi does well to collect a throw from the sub Shankar at deep cover. The third umpire confirms that Starc is about a metre short. 49th over: Australia 312-8 (Carey 52, Starc 3) Target 353 Bumrah gets through the 49th over of the innings with a series of slower balls and accurate yorkers. Just the one run off the bat, two byes coming as well when he beats Dhoni. Too good.48th over: Australia 309-8 (Carey 51, Starc 3) Target 353 Shot. Carey pulls Bhuvi hard out to midwicket for four and follows it with a glance that takes him to a half-century in 25 balls - the fastest of this World Cup. We Will Rock You plays around The Oval between overs and the Indian fans can’t get enough of it. They’ve had quite the South London day out. This is a fine win they are about to celebrate.After carving Bumrah behind point for four earlier in the over, Cummins falls to the Indian attack leader when trying to launch him into the next postcode, tickling his slower ball through to Dhoni. Not far away now. “I know I’m banging on unceasingly about the new rigour India have been rocking recently,” writes Robert Wilson. I don’t mind, if it helps me work out how I’m going to bash out 1000 words later tonight. “But there’s been a mistaken air of perplexity and mystification about the shape of this game in both innings. It’s all going to plan. The simple rule is if you think there’s something going on, there’s quite often something going on. People forget about the Windies heyday. Yes, there was flash and dash but it was also getting the foot on the throat early, relaxing those hammies and just staying in that inexorable and devastating posture until the oppo’s life and hope ebbed away. India have controlled this game utterly. They’re Jack Palance in a hotel room with an attaché case in a 1970s B-movie. Can’t you hear the Quincy Jones soundtrack as they emotionlessly assemble the sniper rifle?”Okay, this is great. Next: can you get to the bottom of why every TV commentator identifies Pat Cummins Pat CumminGs? What’s going on there? 46th over: Australia 291-7 (Carey 43, Cummins 1) Target 353 Carey is showing plenty. Granted, his dropping of Hardik Pandya from the first ball he faced is more important in the final analysis than the runs he is adding, but still, it’s a long competition and he is playing an important role at No7. A well timed slap over cover, picking up Bhuvi from well outside the off-stump, takes him into the 40s.45th over: Australia 284-7 (Carey 37, Cummins 0) Target 353 Earlier the over, it was all going so well for Australia when Carey uppercut the first ball of Bumrah’s over for four. But along with the wicket, only two further singles came. They now need 69 from 30. Michael Slater still thinks they’ll win, for what that’s worth. Fascinating email in from Kandukuru Nagarjun that I wish I had more time to engage with. “Never mind one song,” he says, “our Usman’s name cues a whole genre: mystical Sufi music popular in Pakistan, India and several other countries influenced by the Ottomans and Persians. The word ‘Khawaja’ means ‘Sufi tutor’ in Persian and features in countless songs of the genre.Here are two masterful ones: A Nusrat Ali KhanAn AR RahmanThe Rahman one (in UrduHindi) starts like this. Loose translation: Oh Khawaja, my lord, helper of the poor, helper of the faith, come reside in my heart...Kohli gives it BIG after taking a well-struck NCN swipe at midwicket on the rope. Bumrah gets him with the slower ball, fingers run down the seam. Good bowling.44th over: Australia 278-6 (Carey 31, Coulter-Nile 4) Target 353 Hardik has one over left, and Kohli is giving it to him, I assume, so that Kuldeep doesn’t need to bowl his 10th at the death. Working around the field in 1s and 2s until the fifth delivery, Carey again nailed a strike down the ground as he did in the previous set, this time for four. Nine off it, which is still short of where they need to be but keeping Australia just within touching distance. They need 75 from 36. 43rd over: Australia 269-6 (Carey 23, Coulter-Nile 3) Target 353 Well, they need 12 an over and Carey just took 13 from Chahal’s 10th, finishing with 262 including the huge wicket of Maxwell. He got them with a fine slog sweep for four and a mighty strike over the legspinner’s head into the pavilion. He’s 23 off 10 balls. 42nd over: Australia 256-6 (Carey 10, Coulter-Nile 3) Target 353 Nine off the Bumrah over, helped by Jadeja when taking a ping when Carey who took him on at backward point. Missing the stumps (for one in his life) the ball ran away for four overthrows. Two a ball required for Australia, if you were wondering.Back to our topic before all hell broke loose? “The most obvious earworm in relation to this game has to be Public Enemy Yo! Bumrah-sh the Show,” suggests Adam Levine. “How about Adele belting out Rolling in Kuldeep?” emails Brian Withington. “The Australian batsman certainly haven’t been able to do much with him.” Very good.41st over: Australia 247-6 (Carey 4, Coulter-Nile 0) Target 353 Another great bowling change from Kohli, no doubt knowing the ridiculous record Chahal has when it comes to Maxwell. There’s nearly a second wicket to finish the succesful over, NCN racing to the danger end when Carey called him through for two through midwicket. The throw misses and West Australian survives. Sorry I haven’t been able to get to your emails over the last half an hour or so - too much going on in front of me. I’ll do my best to triage in an over or two.No, THAT is the loudest roar of the day! DEAFENING as Maxwell holes out to midwicket, trying to register a second boundary for the over but picking out the wrong man with a skied hoick, Jadeja, on as a sub. Game over.Bowled him! Second ball. The crowd go absolutely WILD in the stands. One precondition for a Maxwell Miracle was having an established player riding shotgun with him but that’s not happening now. Bhuvi went through Stoinis between bat and pad, who didn’t move his feet at all. Poor dismissal.Smith has missed Bhuvi’s off-cutter when trying to work him through midwicket, struck on the knee roll. Given not out, Kohli had no hesitation sending it upstairs. The technology confirmed the former captain’s fate. Very, very out. 39th over: Australia 235-3 (Smith 68, Maxwell 21) Target 353 Another big over, off the main man Bumrah. Maxwell as opened the door and Smith is walking through it. The former’s strike through midwicket to begin got the ball rolling, picking up the length early and smashing it to the Peter May Stand. Giving the strike back to Smith, he has a pop at the fourth ball and is rewarded for it, his inside edge running away for four. He somehow manages to get the last one away too, a bumper aimed at his lid. 13 from it. Maxwell has 21 from 9. 38th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 60, Maxwell 16) Target 353 Maxwell begins his innings with three boundaries in four balls. It is Bhuvi who cops it, back into the attack and cut hard to the gap at backward point. SHOT. Next up: a gorgeous glide beating third man to the rope. He keeps going, two more to square leg. He misses Bhuvi’s slower ball but hammers a pull shot, albeit to the fielder on the rope. Smith’s turn, who glances perfectly to the fine leg boundary. That’s 15 from the over, if you don’t mind. The Indian fans know as well as anyone what Maxwell could do here if it comes together in the final ten overs. Don’t go anywhere. 37th over: Australia 207-3 (Smith 56, Maxwell 5) Target 353 Here is the thing: Maxwell will believe he can win it. There’s no doubt about that it is just how he is built. Reflecting this, he smashes Bumrah straight back down the ground for four. What a shot. Amusingly, as he told us when talking to him before the tournament, he doesn’t do any gym work. His power is all a product of natural timing. Freak. What an option for Kohli to turn to after a good over for Australia: the top-ranked ODI bowler in the world, Jasprit Bumrah. And he’s in the game within four balls, castling Khawaja when the left-hander tried and failed to lap him over fine leg. The crowd to my left are as loud now as they have been at any time today. They can sense how close India are to victory now. Then again, here comes Maxwell.36th over: Australia 201-2 (Smith 55, Khawaja 42) Target 353 Well, Khawaja goes bangbang. Kuldeep is the man they are going after. Taking on his stock ball spinning away from him, the left-hander gets down on one knee to slog sweep him into the grandstand. And he does again, albeit along the ground and a fraction squarer, this time for four! With four more picked up along the way, the over is worth 14 for Australia, which keeps the rate required south of 11. That’s not for nothing. The final shot from Khawaja, two over cover, also raises the 200. 35th over: Australia 187-2 (Smith 54, Khawaja 29) Target 353 I like this from Kohli, getting Pandya back on to shake things up after boundaries from each of the last three overs from spin. Oh, scrap that: Khawaja has got stuck into an impotent short ball, creaming it through midwicket out to the Bedser Stand for four. The good news for India is that they have now exhausted the overs that they require from their fifth bowler. Bumrah and Bhuvi will be back soon enough. 34th over: Australia 180-2 (Smith 53 Khawaja 24) Target 353 Ending the Kuldeep over with with a lovely cover-driven boundary, Smith records his second half century in a row from 60 balls. Kuldeep has 041 from his eight. Nothing wrong with that at all. Who will Australia target? They have to take someone down.33rd over: Australia 172-2 (Smith 47, Khawaja 22) Target 353 Boundaries in consecutive overs for Khawaja, sweeping and sweeping well. Chahal bounces back well, denying him a second chance to find the rope. Drinks! The required rate is 10.65 still 181 runs left to collect, more than what they currently have in 33 overs. 32nd over: Australia 165-2 (Smith 45, Khawaja 17) Target 353 Kuldeep has Khawaja on the rack until the final delivery, when the left-hander is able to, at last, lift him over fine leg for four. He made it possible getting across his stumps to create something. There has to be more of that over the next few overs to keep them vaguely in touch. Still, only six from it.31st over: Australia 159-2 (Smith 44, Khawaja 12) Target 353 Dhoni stumping chance! He’s up after Smith’s inside edge ends up with him, removing the bails as the former Australian captain es back. TV confirms that he’s safe - just. MS was involved in saving runs earlier in the over too, off his helmet, when Khawaja’s reverse crashed into it. Four off it. What does Smith do next? It has to be him.30th over: Australia 155-2 (Smith 42, Khawaja 10) Target 353 The crowd are cheering every ball, Kuldeep brought back and keeping Smith quiet with four dots through the middle of the over, landing his stock delivery in a dangerous channel time and again. He gets on to one pull shot but Kohli - shuffled back onto the circle by Dhoni, Clarke observes - has enough time to stop it. Two off it. Fantastic bowling. I said in my first post today that the Indian plan with the bat was executed to perfection. Their squeeze with the ball is going much the same way. They now need more than 10 an over to win. Wouldn’t have thought so.29th over: Australia 153-2 (Smith 41, Khawaja 9) Target 353 Chahal does it again. Smith misses his sweep before giving the strike to Khawaja. The Queensland captain is very lucky not to give a catch back to the leggie off his leading edge, getting two instead. Smith picks out fielders on the circle from the final two deliveries, making just four from it. This chase is drowning. 28th over: Australia 149-2 (Smith 40, Khawaja 6) Target 353 Brilliant from KL Rahul, ensuring that another over elapses without a boundary by putting in a magnificent one-handed e on the deep cover rope. Smith is trying his hardest to creates something - anything - by moving around the crease, but the shots aren’t bisecting the sweepers. 26 runs have been scored from the last five overs Pandya just one further to bowl before Kohli can rotate between his top four.27th over: Australia 144-2 (Smith 36, Khawaja 5) Target 353 In fairness to Khawaja, this is not an easy time to walk out. He’s resourceful here, using the pace of Chahal to paddle a couple fine. But other than that, with three singles to the sweepers, it is another over with only five from it. With that, the required rate inches up to 9.2. Romeo informs me that Australia aren’t in as much trouble as Notts, who are all out for 162 with Kyle Abbott snaring 637 for Hampshire. I’ll take his word for it!26th over: Australia 139-2 (Smith 34, Khawaja 2) Target 353 Five singles off Pandya. More importantly, that’s the seventh over he’s bowled. Add Jadhav’s, and Kohli is only two away from having his fifth bowler dealt with before over 30. Top captaincy. “I’ll happily help out with your choice of music for the above, Collo,” offers Iain McKane. “We could set up the South London equivalent of Chicky’s Disco at the old Antigua Rec. I’m sure your pop-tastic young-person’s taste will leaven my heady mix of metalcore, ‘60s garage blues, and free-jazz into something palatable for the groovy Vauxhall cognoscenti.” I’ve always said that this is the role I was born to play. 25th over: Australia 134-2 (Smith 31, Khawaja 0) Target 353 Khawaja, not known for his brisk scoring outside of the power play, joins Smith. He doesn’t have long to find his stride here. Not when the required rate is already at 9s.Chahal is spun around to the pavilion end and it works! Coming down the track to take on the leggie against the wind, Warner doesn’t get all of it and Bhuvi is out on the rope to take the straightforward outfield chance. The end of an unflattering innings for the Australian opener. They’re in big strife.24th over: Australia 127-1 (Warner 56, Smith 27) Target 353 Kohli is trying to get through this fifth bowler overs as quickly as possible, throwing the ball back to Pandya for his sith. Warner times a potent pull shot into the gap but a boundary is prevented by some tag-team ground fielding on the rope out there. That aside, it’s another relaxed over where both sides seem happy to allow about a run a ball to be added for the time being. Who do Australia bring in next? 23rd over: Australia 121-1 (Warner 51, Smith 26) Target 353 Okay, another crucial mini-period of this game with Jadhav into the attack with his side-arm nothings. Kohli is so clever in the way that he uses him, always when the pressure is on the opposition. But Smith knows his feet are fast enough to deal with any challenge this bowler presents and charges him accordingly, launching over long-on FOR SIX! They needed that. Helped by two legside wides, with the pressure now back on the pint-sized all-rounder, Smith gets down low to smash him through midwicket to slog-sweep four more! 15 from the over. Might that be the opening?22nd over: Australia 107-1 (Warner 50, Smith 15) Target 353 That has to be Warner’s slowest half-century in ODIs, taking 76 to reach the mark. More important for India is that Chahal has raced through another over giving away just two singles. The required rate is now 8.8 runs an over. As I said an hour ago, this is perfectly set up for Maxwell to be the scapegoat, coming in with 10s needed.21st over: Australia105-1 (Warner 49, Smith 14) Target 353 Bumrah’s back for a second burst, having bowled just three overs in his opening spell. And Warner enjoys the pace on the ball, carving the first legal delivery (following a misdirected bumper) over the cordon. There’s not a lot going on for Australia thereafter, Bumrah on top with both his accurate slower ball and much faster bouncer, which hits Smith in his stomachchest. Ouch. It’s very, very dark at The Oval now. 20th over: Australia 99-1 (Warner 45, Smith 14) Target 353 The DLS par score is 118 after 20 overs, which isn’t a bad guide to how far the Australians are behind the chase. At this stage, it’ll suit Kohli and Chahal for five singles to be taken from the leggie, mostly down the ground. They’re doing a fine job in defence of their total.“It may be that because there is an electric circuit to the bails from the stumps, they are actually attracted to the stumps and hence harder to knock off,” Phillip Haran theorises. “Given everything else about them is the same, I think it most likely!” I’m going to get to the bottom of this after the game. 19th over: Australia 94-1 (Warner 42, Smith 12) Target 353 Warner gets a long-hop from Kuldeep first up and helps himself to four through cover. ‘Who Let The Dogs Out?’ plays around the ground. Hmm. As I’ve said to Surrey several times, I’m ready and willing to take over as the Cricket Ground DJ here at a moment’s notice. Three singles are added in the usual middle-overs fashion, Kuldeep mixing that up with a flighted leg break that Warner elects not to go after. No rain scheduled until 8pm tonight, the TV commentary says. Good. It sure is chilly, though.18th over: Australia 87-1 (Warner 36, Smith 11) Target 353 Chahal’s turn, which Smith doesn’t mind at all when taking two through the gap at cover from his first ball and two more through the midwicket region from the second. This is a bowler who has plenty of experience bowling Australia out, so they would have prepared well for his overs, I am sure. Warner adds two later in the over as well, sweeping off his glove into Dhoni’s pad - well away from his gloves. By the way, is anyone keeping their eyes on his gloves? I assume he’s followed the ICC’s orders? 17th over: Australia 79-1 (Warner 33, Smith 6) Target 353 Four off this accurate Kuldeep over, the Australians happy enough taking the singles on offer to sweepers square of the wicket and down the ground. No risks. “Warner looks well off his stride here,” observes Bob Wilson. “A mix of his form and some really strangly bowling. Given his ‘temperament’, he’s bound to go all hormonal about it in a minute. Which will produce fireworks in one of two directions. Either way, a spectator win. I still do love watching him emote.”Notwithstanding what went down in South Africa last year, he is very zen these days. For better or worse. Mind you, a bit of Old Davey Warner might be required as far as launching some sixes over cow corner. Not quite yet, though.16th over: Australia 75-1 (Warner 31, Smith 4) Target 353 Bad from Pandya to begin, overstepping from around the wicket at Warner who has a crack at the short ball, pulling it for four! He doesn’t make the most of the free hit that follows but it can only help the opener’s confidence. Pandya is back over the wicket at flings down a short ball that keeps Warner thinking. One, two, three singles finish the final over as they head into the drinks break. They now need 8.18 an over. “Smith and Warner BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE of this RRR,” lols Scott Oliver. “Yes, I know. Sorry.” Fair play. I’ve seen plenty worse. At the drinks break they have a band playing Waltzing Matilda. Yeah, that might have worked if more than about 30 Australians were in the crowd right now.15th over: Australia 67-1 (Warner 25, Smith 3) Target 353 Kuldeep nearly wins the wicket of Warner off an inside edge, that is provided the bails would have fallen off anyway. The former leadership axis exchange singles through the legside, the southpaw then keeping the strike with one down the ground.Steve V has arrived in my inbox with his earworm.Michael Lacquiere has one too. “For a couple of decades the names Andy Caddick and Nasser Hussain have pleasingly brought to mind the lyrics of that fabled cricket anthem “Breathe” by their natural musical soulmates, The Prodigy - as in “Psycho somatic, Caddick Hussain”.

The Mercedes is in dreamland. Leclerc, on youthful tyres, is 3.4sec behind Hamilton.Lap 6470: Vettel’s lead has been cut to a slender 0.9sec. That is not going to be anywhere near enough to win. To make matters worse, Leclerc is whizzing round. He has just set a new fastest lap of 1.14. Vettel could finish third at this rate.Lap 6270: The fight at the front of the grid was brewing beautifully – but that five-second penalty might deprive us of any late drama. Vettel is struggling to build the kind of lead he needs to. The Ferrari is two seconds in front of Hamilton, 10sec in front of Leclerc.Lap 6070: “Where the hell was I supposed to go?” asks Vettel. “They are stealing the race from us.” The Ferrari driver is absolutely livid. “Stay focused, confident,” is the message back at him down the team radio. Ferrari are powerless to even appeal that five-second penalty, which will be added on to Vettel’s time as soon as he passes through the chequered flag. That penalty seems harsh on Vettel – but Hamilton called for it straightaway. Räikkönen, meanwhile, makes a second stop.Lap 5970: “Stay on his gearbox,” is the message from Mercedes to Hamilton. Providing he stays on the tail of Vettel, the Briton has a healthy chance of picking up victory. Hamilton wants more power from his car, but the news that Vettel has been penalised for that collision on lap 48 is the perfect fillip.Lap 5870: Well, well, well ... Sebastien Vettel has been slapped with a five-second time penalty by the FIA for “unsafe re-entry and forcing another driver off the track”. Hamilton did have to jam his brakes on out of turn four. That is music to the ears of Mercedes, particularly Hamilton. Suddenly Vettel needs to put his foot down and more than triple his lead. “I had nowhere to go, seriously,” Vettel says.Lap 5770: Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.7sec.Lap 5570: Kevin Magnussen, it is fair to say, is moping his way round Montreal. “This is the worst experience I have ever had, in any race car,” says the Haas driver. “It is not a nice experience. Enough means enough.” Hardly a glowing endorsement. Magnussen, who crashed in Q2, meaning his car required a total facelift, is way down in 18th. He is having a torrid time.Lap 5470: Vettel has found an extra big of zip from somewhere, extending his lead over Hamilton to 1.5sec. Meanwhile, Bottas sets a new fastest lap.Lap 5370: Verstappen is up into fifth, ahead of Ricciardo. Lap 5270: Vettel leads Hamilton by 0.8sec.Lap 5170: Relentless driving out in front! A tantalising bit of racing between Vettel and Hamilton – and you sense there is still plenty to come yet. These are the kind of fights Hamilton says he relishes.Lap 4970: Vettel laps the Toro Rosso of Alex Albon, with Hamilton still in close company. Things are beginning to heat up in Montreal.Lap 4870: Vettel goes wide – but the Ferrari gets away with it! A huge error goes unpunished and the German – just about – manages to preserve his lead. The rear wheels did not stick and Hamilton thought he could e in to steal the lead but Vettel held his nerve. Hamilton argues that the manner in which Vettel rejoined the track – effectively shoving the Mercedes up on the ropes, against the wall at turn four – was dangerous. The stewards are having a nosy at it. It would seem harsh.Lap 4770: Stroll comes back out of the pits and stays among the points, ahead of Kvyat to take 10th. Vettel’s lead has been cut to 0.7sec ...Lap 4670: Hamilton is closing again on Vettel, who has just called in to Ferrari with a moan about something. That is all the initiative Hamilton needs at the moment. The Mercedes is right on the tail of the race leader. Meanwhile Lance Stroll finally pits. On go the medium tyres, having already run the hard tyres.Lap 4570: Bottas sets a fastest lap of 1.14.933. Lap 4370: “Brake pedal almost on the floor,” shouts Verstappen down the Red Bull team radio. Unfortunately for him, there is a long, long way to go. Just ask Vettel, who has another 27 laps of slogging it out with Hamilton. A gentle reminder that Verstappen and Lance Stroll are the only two drivers yet to stop.Lap 4170: That is the second time Hamilton has made a mess of coming out of the hairpin. And Vettel breathes an inaudible sigh of relief. The Ferrari is determined to stretch his legs once more. Lap 4070: For the first time, Vettel is feeling the heat. But Hamilton goes wide into turn 10. That was clumsy, locking up a little bit. The Mercedes swiftly undoes some of – but not all of – that hard work. The gap is simply one second.Lap 3970: Bottas zooms beyond Ricciardo, and makes the move stick. Bottas is not hanging around. Next up? Closing the gap on Verstappen. Hamilton is really beginning to gain on Vettel, who made a meal of lapping Räikkönen. The Mercedes trails by 0.8sec ... Lap 3770: Mercedes politely ask Bottas to up the ante. He is closing on the Renault of Ricciardo, too. Vettel is 1.8sec ahead of Hamilton.Lap 3670: Vettel leads Hamilton by 2.5secs, with over half the race gone. Leclerc is third, 1.5sec ahead of Verstappen. All to play for!Lap 3470: Hamilton sets a lightning fastest lap of 1.15.2. Ricciardo and Bottas, meanwhile, tussle wheel-to-wheel for fifth, but the former clings on to stand his ground. The Mercedes is hungry. Down the grid, Antonio Giovinazzi pits, presumably for a breather as much as anything after a wild couple of laps.Lap 3370: In comes Charles Leclerc, allowing Sebastien Vettel to re-gain the lead. Hamilton will jump into second. Leclerc is in and out, but arrives back on the track a little out of touch. Leclerc is fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.Lap 3270: Hülkenberg remains seventh but continues to have gearbox issues. He jinks off the track before regaining his position. And Grosjean loses out to Sergio Pérez. Grosjean is not happy about it, asking for race control intervention.Lap 3170: Bottas is told to box, and he will jet into the pits. “Are we going long, trying to keep this pace?” asks Leclerc down the team radio. Meanwhile the Alfa Romeo Antonio Giovinazzi veers off the track at turn 1, losing ground in 11th.Lap 3070: Vettel sets a new fastest lap of 1.15.333, as Hamilton races out of the pits just in front of his team-mate Bottas. Leclerc, who is yet to pit, is out in front, around 11sec ahead of Vettel. Things are looking rosy for Ferrari.Lap 2970: Hamilton fumes down the team radio, slagging off his flailing tyres. He is going to pit ..Lap 2870: Hammer time for Hamilton, the new race leader. Leclerc is 2.3sec behind the Mercedes, with Vettel slotting into third. “We are going to extend as much as we can,” Hamilton is told down the team radio. Bottas is fourth.Lap 2770: Vettel pits! On go the hard tyres. A 2.7sec stop.Lap 2670: Hamilton sounds breathless down the team radio. It is almost 50C out on the track. Whoever takes victory will have to work for it.Lap 2570: Who will blink first? Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.6sec. “Push now, push now” Ferrari tell the race leader down the team radio. Lovely stuff.Lap 2470: Lance Stroll is having a good time. He started in 17th but is up to eighth. Saying that, he is yet to pit. Meanwhile, trouble in paradise for Hülkenberg? He is having a moan down the team radio. It does not sound good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e831240659a096031ddf3525f59ffa3063dfe7be/0_96_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=005513cb18c535ed98608116c441a677","title":"send tip uk river canal walk win 200 hotel voucher","story":"Full of nature, history and great pubs, our towpaths are fabulous places to walk.

There’s even a new festival in Verbier celebrating their popularityThe first time it happened was three years ago. I was cycling up the Col de l’Iseran in the French Alps with my friend Tim. At 2,764 metres, it’s the highest paved road in the Alps and, as we panted and gasped our way upwards, we were overtaken by a couple of middle-aged women chatting away happily.Tim and I like to think we’re reasonably fit, if not exactly Geraint Thomas, so I looked across at him in horror. To which he replied knowingly: “They’re on ebikes.” Phew.Being overtaken like this has now become a regular event on my rides in the Alps, and while I once complained about ebike riders “cheating”, I no longer can, as I recently bought my own electric mountain bike. Like countless others I’ve given in to the lure of the electric motor. Living in Les Arcs, in the French Alps, I can enjoy access to fantastic mountain bike routes when the ski lifts are open from July to the end of August, but getting to the top of those mountains once the lifts close is a long, hard slog, and I’m not getting any younger.Plenty of purists still argue that this is not “real” cycling, but if it gets you out and about on a bike – whether along a canal towpath or to the summit of Mont Ventoux – who cares?My ebike allows me to actually enjoy riding up hills, as well as letting me race down them at the same speed (if not faster) as on my regular mountain bike. Take, for example, the trails above my home on the edge of Les Arcs – there’s a mix of fire road and single-track climbs that ascend from 1,200 to over 2,000 metres and, when I ride up them on my normal bike, it’s not exactly a fun experience. Desperately gulping at the thinning air, I can usually see little more than the trail ahead as the sweat trickles down the lenses of my sunglasses. On my ebike I still have to make some effort but the motor (which has four levels of “assist”) reduces the effort enough for me to enjoy the scenery and the pine-scented air as I wend up through the forest to emerge, eventually, above the tree line.Rather than having to stop to get my breath back before I can take in the views, I’m able to pedal along at the same time as enjoying a spectacular alpine panorama of deep green valleys rising to high peaks, with the snowy Mont Blanc massif above.What’s more, on my regular mountain bike, I’d do this climb once, then belt back home and be done for the day – exhausted. On my ebike I have plenty of energy left to do another lap, maybe even two, which also undermines the assumption that you don’t get as much of a workout on an ebike. In fact, research has shown that ebike users get as much as seven times more use out of their bikes as regular cyclists, which makes up for the lack of effort required to power the bike.Ebikes have now become so popular that ski resorts like Avoriaz have introduced “uphill flow” trails – ones specifically designed to be ridden uphill. Add to this the fact that ebike riders don’t need to be whippet-thin Mamils (middle-age men in Lycra) to enjoy cycling through stunning scenery like that of the Alps, the Lake District and the Scottish Highlands, and it’s little wonder this is becoming the big new trend in cycling.This August, the Swiss Alps will host the world’s biggest ebike event: the four-day Verbier Ebike Festival is open to every level of rider, including absolute beginners, with the aim of introducing both converts and non-believers to road, downhill, and cross-country ebiking. It is set to be repeated annually.All participants will be supplied with ebikes if they don’t have their own, and there’s the chance to try out 30 brands of machine on the bike trails, gravel tracks and mountain roads. There’ll be bike tours, both guided and non-guided, that take in the best restaurants races for all levels of ability over 38km, 66km and 100km routes (plus kids’ races) and evening events including barbecues, concerts and the chance to meet professional ebike riders.Julien Hess, managing director of the festival, says the resort was inspired to hold the event by the growth in the number of ebikers and the demand for summer events in Verbier. “We expect the festival to attract visitors who come here to ski and now want to experience the area in summer, and to mountain bikers and cyclists of all ages and experience”.Hess sees ebiking as adding another string to the bow of resorts such as Verbier, giving them the opportunity to increase the number of summer visitors, allowing those visitors to rediscover the area without its winter snows, as well as giving pretty much everyone the chance to ride a bike in the mountains.“Ebikes also allow people with limited fitness or disabilities to enjoy cycling in the spectacular surroundings of the Alps, as well as helping in the battle against sedentary lifestyles.”As for the hair shirt brigade who claim ebiking is cheating, he simply says: “Come and give it a try and then we can talk again! And if you’ve already given it a go and are still not convinced, I’ll find you a challenge with an ebike that will make you change your mind …”• The Verbier Ebike Festival runs from 15-18 August.

Described as “the conscience of liberal Britain”, O’Brien is the author of the bestselling book How to Be Right...In a World Gone Wrong, a guide to challenging those who hold “unchallenged opinions”.I’m not interested in opinions unless they’re based on fact and, tragically, too many places in the media, particularly with regards to politicians, will allow people to say things that are simply not true and leave them unchallenged.How often do you think you change people’s minds?Not as often as I’d like. I had a chap at a festival of debate a few weeks ago who was a fully paid up member of the EDL before he started listening to my show and he stood up in front of 600 people and said: “I think you saved my life.” Those moments are incredibly important to me, but that’s extreme. I’m not arrogant or naive enough to think I’m moving the needle on national conversation anywhere near enough.If you call your book How to Be Right, is it fair for people to accuse you of being smug?I think people who peddle lies for a living call people who tell the truth smug. I’m not smug – smug would mean I was enjoying this.Do you feel people are fundamentally good?Of course I do you have to. Look at the effort being put in to make people believe bad things: the effort is immense, it’s the richest people on the planet, the most powerful media owners, it’s the demagogues with the biggest platforms, the season ticket holders on Question Time. There is a commercial and audience imperative in this country where if it gets chatter going and it gets clicks, a big reaction, then it must be good. But of course, when ordinary punters watch this stuff, they don’t see a circus or bonfire, they just get seduced by the narcissism and you don’t have good tunes if you’re on the side of kindness and decency – you have nothing to point at.You sound defeated even by the fightback!It’s pathetic. It’s astonishing the factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories or in the last few years, the government. They’re obsessed with centrists, they’re obsessed with Blairites, they’re obsessed with denying antisemitism when it’s right there in front of them, so all that has incubated the problem.Does a career in traditional politics beckon for you?I have a silent rule that anyone who wants to go into politics should be banned – you should be forced to go into politics by plebiscite because people think you could bring something to the table. So it’s highly unlikely.Given the success of the Brexit party, Farage might believe the same applies to himself?Farage is simply a very very good heckler. He couldn’t be involved in delivering Brexit, he couldn’t be involved in delivering policy, he couldn’t be involved in putting together a proper manifesto or assembling a proper political party, all he can do is assemble a dizzying array of rotten tomatoes, stand at the side of the stage and lob them at the poor sods who are trying to make some sense of the current matter.You’ve just been on holiday – what did you enjoy reading?I’m halfway through The Ministry of Truth, Dorian Lynskey’s biography of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it’s absurdly good.What was the last thing that made you laugh?My 13-year-old daughter is addicted to Saturday Night Live sketches on YouTube and Pete Davidson’s character Chad brings me pretty close to wetting myself every time I watch him.How do you relax and switch off?Crime fiction. We live near the Thames and I like to walk the dog there as often as I can. I love walking up to Brentford where there’s still a boatyard and a real sense of when the river was an industrial hub. And I try to play Fifa on the PlayStation once a week with one of my oldest friends – we’ve been doing so for nearly 30 years!

Four protesters were killed in sporadic violence in the two cities.The Sudanese Professionals Association, a leading opposition group, said it had called on people to stay home in protest at the deaths of more than 100 people on Monday last week, when security forces violently dispersed a pro-democracy sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum.“The peaceful resistance by civil disobedience and the general political strike is the fastest and most effective way to topple the military council … and to hand over power to a transitional civilian authority,” the SPA said.The military took power after ousting the then president, Omar al-Bashir, in April after months of mass rallies. The ruling Transitional Military Council has since refused demonstrators’ demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement.Talks between the opposition Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces alliance and the TMC, which took power after Bashir’s departure, ground to a halt last month then collapsed altogether after the raid on the protest camp.Residents said heavily armed paramilitaries from the Rapid Support Forces were patrolling parts of Khartoum while the regular army has now deployed in some parts of Omdurman.The RSF, which is largely made up of militias accused of systemic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur, has been blamed for the killings last week. The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – who also serves as the deputy head of the TMC.The Sudan Doctors’ Committee, the medical affiliate of the SPA, said at least three people were killed on Sunday, including a young man who was shot dead by the RSF in Khartoum’s Bahri neighbourhood. The other two died of their injuries after RSF forces beat them in Omdurman, it said.Activists say that professionals including bankers, doctors, air traffic control staff, pilots, electrical engineers and economists have been targeted by intelligence services in what they say is an obvious attempt to break the strike.The central bank issued a statement that said it would not go on strike, but many employees stayed away.The SPA said airport workers and pilots were taking part in the civil disobedience, and posted photos of a deserted Khartoum international airport.“Dozens of airport workers have been arrested by intelligence and the RSF since Monday. We do not know their whereabouts,” an airport worker said on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.Activists said the total number of people detained by security services in recent days was unclear but was probably in the hundreds. Two opposition leaders who met the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in Khartoum on Friday have been detained, along with an opposition spokesman. Abiy was in the Sudanese capital to mediate between the TMC and the opposition, which has refused to reopen negotiations.The internet remains cut off in Khartoum, with other communications significantly restricted.Sudan’s military leaders have come under increasing international pressure in recent days. The brutal crackdown prompted outrage in the west while the African Union suspended the country and threatened sanctions if there was no swift transition to democracy.Even Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appear to be moderating their previous policy of unconditional support for the TMC, after calls to senior officials from counterparts in Washington.The TMC will be hoping the opposition will not be able to sustain the shutdown for longer than a few days and, if the strike continues, will face a difficult choice: make concessions or intensify repression, risking further isolation and economic difficulties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e2a6bc719822b6742395ab8dba4805a14139e4/0_0_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09a93c0feb4466fc29fcc9419876bcbc","title":"newly restored 19th century german ship sinks after collision","story":"Elbe No 5, restored at a cost of €1.5m, collided with container vessel near HamburgA recently restored wooden sailing ship has sunk after colliding with a container vessel near Hamburg, northern Germany.Six adults and two children were injured when the gaff-rigged schooner Elbe No 5, originally built in 1883, collided with a Cyprus-flagged vessel, Astrosprinter, on the River Elbe after a failed tack steered the sailing ship directly into the container ship’s path.All 43 passengers were rescued almost immediately thanks to a quick response from five rescue boats that were attending a minor accident a few hundred meters away. “If we hadn’t been in the vicinity there could have been fatalities,” a fire service official, Wilfried Sprekels, told the local newspaper Stader Tageblatt.But the rescue team could not prevent the ship from sinking while they dragged it to shore.The 37-metre (121ft) schooner, built as a vehicle for pilots guiding larger craft from the sea to Hamburg’s port, was the city’s last remaining seagoing ship from the era of wooden vessels.In the 1920s the ship was sold to the US where the adventurer Warwick Tompkins and his family temporarily used it as a floating home. In 2002 the vessel returned to its home town where it could be rented for harbour excursions.In the last nine months the Elbe No 5 was renovated with new outer wooden planks and a new stern at a cost of €1.5m (£1.3m). It resumed taking visitors on tours around Hamburg’s harbour at the end of last month.Wolfgang Bentz, who worked on restoring the ship, told the radio station NDR that he and colleagues had spent the night watching over the wreck, whose broken mast was protruding from the water. “I couldn’t sleep all night,” he said.Bentz said there was a chance that the Elbe No 5 could take to sea again. “It’s made of wood and had some damage before. Let’s see what further damage is added in the rescue effort.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919990.1560098311!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ceann comhairle apologises to angela kerins for pac treatment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAngela Kerins, chief executive of Rehab, arriving for the PAC meeting in 2014.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Our party is firstly our constituents, it is the Republic.”The Republicans are desperately seeking a new leader. Laurent Wauquiez, the party’s former chief, resigned a week after the European elections.Mr Macron has taken advantage of the party’s existential crisis to renew his charm offensive to gain conservative support.He had already poached many senior Republicans, including his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, after his 2017 election victory.They backed Mr Macron after the defeat of François Fillon, the conservative presidential candidate, which left Ms Le Pen and Mr Macron to go through to the second round of the election.BBC jumps on \u0026#39hopepunk\u0026#39 trend with new positive podcast for millennials who don\u0026#39t want \u0026#39dark\u0026#39 dramas Sajid Javid\u0026#39s decision to strip Shamima Begum of her citizenship questioned by one of UK\u0026#39s most senior judgesEmmanuel Macron warns Boris Johnson UK economy be plunged into turmoil if he withholds £39bn orce paymentComment: A curse on our public figures who think it’s cool to swearWeather: June expected to be wettest on record, as Met Office warn of potential floodsPublic not warned about listeria outbreak because it was \u0026#39contained\u0026#39 experts insistComment: Our electoral system won\u0026#39t survive Brexit.

I had them in mind young men who will accept their responsibilities but don\u0027t want to do it the old-fashioned way, who want to be out in the world, living like and learning from their people.He added: Ballet is perceived as old-fashioned and elitist - and it certainly has its moments. Ballet can be popular and moving and appeal to everyone. Productions like this prove that point.I made this Cinderella before the #MeToo movement. We were keen to create a strong Cinderella who is in control of her own destiny. Who is not diminished and waify.Cinderella, which is being staged at the Royal Albert Hall until June 16, is the English National Ballet\u0027s biggest production to date - featuring 130 dancers wearing a total of 370 costumes across 197 roles.Wheeldon, who was made an OBE in 2016, counts Alice\u0027s Adventures in Wonderland and The Winter\u0027s Tale among his long list of productions for The Royal Ballet.He himself trained at the world famous dance school and danced with the company from 1991 to 1993.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017. The most recent set of Purchasing Managers’ Index figures showed the sector is now shrinking as the wider economy stagnates.The GMB union, which is doing its best to support its members through what will be a miserable process, says 500,000 manufacturing jobs have gone over the last decade.\u0026nbspMany more redundancies are pending. There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It is still an important part of the UK economy. Particularly in certain specialist areas, Britain is rather good at it, and it still provides thousands of well-paid jobs in places where there aren’t many of those to be had, where there aren’t many alternatives. Places like Bridgend.\u0026nbspTo avoid more of them being plunged into the horror facing that town, this government, or more likely a future one run by people with a little more concern for working people and their jobs, needs to do more than just talk about an industrial strategy. It needs to heed the\u0026nbspGMB’s call for action.\u0026nbspThese events don’t\u0026nbspjust hurt the economy. They\u0026nbspserve to widen the alarming cracks that have opened up in British society, cracks that are being exploited by some very unpleasant people.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Given that many of the people who incur them are under financial stress, that can only be seen as welcome development.\u0026nbspThis sort of policy work can take time (overdraft fees have been a sore point for years), but the FCA is, as a rule, fairly good at it.\u0026nbspCampaigners I have spoken to have also given it high marks for the work it has been doing on financial exclusion, for example. And prior to its overdraft reforms it had capped the interest rates imposed by payday lenders and followed up by clipping the wings of the rent to own sector.\u0026nbspSo, good at policymaking bad at supervisory practice?\u0026nbspThe criticism faced by the watchdog has extended beyond the Woodford mess, about which it could argue that such funds sometimes underperform and investors’ assets are still there. They’ll be able to get their money out once the fund\u0027s illiquid holdings\u0026nbspare sold, albeit probably at a substantial discount.\u0026nbspTake the collapse of bond firm London Capital \u0026amp\u0026nbspFinance, whose unregulated mini bonds left thousands of people out of pocket. It has led to the creation of a judge led inquiry which will, among other things, consider whether the FCA should have intervened at a much earlier stage.\u0026nbspThe regulator has also taken heat over the handling of complaints from small businesses about Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group, and whistleblowers at Lloyds Banking Group. And there are other such examples.Set against that is the fact that the watchdog employs 3,700 people, of whom just 900 are involved in the frontline supervision of nearly 60,000 firms. Its remit also keeps expanding. Claims management firms and funeral plans are both being added.\u0026nbspIt begs the question: Does the FCA’s apparent slow footedness stem from its failure to effectively utilise its resources? Or does it have enough?Chief executive Andrew Bailey has a case to answer on the former. A couple of years ago one of his first big decisions was to set up a windy review of its mission, which really ought to have been obvious.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

We wanted to see if there was something there.”Corden explained that, for a while, himself and co-writer Ruth Jones\u0026nbspfeared there was no reason to bring back the show.\u0026nbsp“Then, once there was, my feeling was, life’s too short,” he continued.\u0026nbsp”Fear is the absolute reason to do it. This sounds ridiculously deep, but none of us are promised tomorrow. We’re here for a minute, so you have to try to do it all. I’d rather regret something than not do it.”Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different.

From the\u0026nbsp50th anniversary of partial decriminalisation of homosexuality to the fifth anniversary of same-sex marriage, we have much to be thankful for. The impact of these achievements,\u0026nbspand the rate of change, from when I attended an all boys Cof E school at the height of Section 28,\u0026nbspis monumental. At the same time, analysis by the University of Manchester\u0026nbspin 2018, based on a National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in 2010, concluded that British society may be reaching “peak acceptance” of LGBT lifestyle and people.\u0026nbspFrom a very early age I was expected to be a diligent, hard working, studious middle son but at school\u0026nbspI was labelled the gay boy, subjected to taunts and homophobic vitriol purely because of appearing effeminateHowever,\u0026nbspI am reminded of a recent conversation with a gay friend, who suggested that equality is a lofty ideal that is far from reality when taken at a societal level.\u0026nbspHis rhetoric was far more colourful than I can attest but he believed as\u0026nbspLGBT people we were still subjected to stereotyping because\u0026nbspwe live in a straight, heteronormative world that\u0026nbspignores and threatens our lifestyles.AFPGetty Images)In my work as Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and trans activist, I have striven for visibility and wider acceptance for the Gaysian community, from within my own community and the\u0026nbspwider society. Being of a British Pakistani heritage, I struggled to come to\u0026nbspterms with my identity, within myself and my family, and this was made doubly difficult by our obsession with labels.Lebanon blocks Grindr in latest attack on LGBT+ communityLGBT+ Muslims to lead Pride march with teacher at centre of protestsPrimary school to close early as anti-LGBT+ lesson protests escalateMalta named best destination for LGBT+ travellersThe\u0026nbspother boys saw me as an outcast, which had no grounding in truth. At this time,\u0026nbspI had no sense\u0026nbspof my own sexuality but in the course of being bullied\u0026nbspI grew to associate with the gay label. If everyone assumed the\u0026nbspyoung Asif\u0026nbspwas gay\u0026nbspthen it must be\u0026nbsptrue. Apart from being sexually attracted to boys I had no deep understanding of my sexuality or what I would, many years later, come to decipher as a differing gender identity.In these formative years I identified myself with the gay label because I\u0026nbspwas being oppressed by\u0026nbspit, which fits western stereotypes of effeminacy in boys as being a gay trait. In Pakistan and the south Asian subcontinent,\u0026nbsptrans identities have long been widely acknowledged, a world away from my British upbringing. It was only in my early thirties that I became fully aware of my trans identity and this only occurred when I stopped defining myself by societal standards.Cashman, comedian Rhona Cameron,\u0026nbspactivist Peter Tatchell and Graham Norton\u0026nbsp(Getty)I’ve had the privilege to come out twice. First, as a gay man, when my mother discovered my stash of LGBT scene magazines: that\u0026nbspissue of Boyz magazine\u0026nbspaltered the course of my life.

I could not tell\u0026nbspmy parents about the abuse I was\u0026nbspgetting at school for fear they would believe it and begin to also question my sexuality.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

At the height of the bullying I did not receive any visible support from teachers, who feared being reprimanded for going against the law.My\u0026nbspschool, with a 95 per cent majority Afro-Caribbean student body, and my British Asian ethnicity,\u0026nbsp also played a big part in my experience. The analysis by the University of Manchester found that BAME\u0026nbsppeople were more likely to hold negative views towards the LGBT community, particularly in the 1990s at the height of misinformation and fear about the HIVAids epidemic and governmental ineptitude.My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentimentOne of my parents’ main fears, which guided their decision to take me to the GP and the local imam, was that I had learnt to be gay because I was exposed to it, from school, from pop culture. Their interpretation of religion and south Asian cultural expectations made them question my foundations – the “gay”\u0026nbsplabel took many years to be normalised and understood within my family unit.At the root of their concern was my happiness and safety. My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay man in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentiment.Tatchell\u0026nbspin Brighton at Pride 2018 (Getty Images)I recently rediscovered\u0026nbspThe Velvet Rage\u0026nbspby Alan Downs, a book I had read in my twenties at the suggestion of my then civil partner who lauded it as ground-breaking. So much of it still resonates. Downs argued that growing up gay in a heterosexual world results in the internalisation of shame, a shame gay men may strive to obscure with material success, creativity, beauty or more severe forms of escapist gratification like substance abuse.The chemsex phenomenon, when people take drugs that enhance sex and make them feel uninhibited, has become a prominent subculture within the LGBT community, which has led to the UK’s criminal and health bodies formulating policy. From personal experience I struggled with my LGBT identity and my role within a greater society.Asifa Lahore: ‘I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim’ (Christine Hayter)Being of south Asian heritage and effeminate prevented me from being taken seriously. Fresh out of\u0026nbspthe Brit school, these loaded labels were a burden and affected my emotional wellbeing. After years of suppressing my creativity and personal growth, in a career that satisfied my traditional parents,\u0026nbspI created my drag alter ego Asifa Lahore –\u0026nbspmy decision to deviate from the rigid gender norm and toxic masculinity\u0026nbspI had been subjected to,\u0026nbspconsciously and subconsciously.Through Asifa Lahore,\u0026nbspI was able to express myself creatively in a physical form that better fitted society’s understanding of what was expected of an effeminate gay man. Through Asifa Lahore the drag queen, I found an art form that allowed me to subvert societal norms. But in a perverted way I was giving in to my critics, who expected that of me\u0026nbspas an effeminate gay man that\u0026nbspputting on a dress and wig would make more sense.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I couldPerforming at cabaret venues and events throughout Britain, I would be heartbroken by the lack of POC faces in the audience, not because they don’t exist but primarily because they don’t feel they belong in these primarily gay, white spaces. The LGBT scene has become more erse but it is still very whitewashed and, arguably, has\u0026nbspracist undertones. Many POC LGBT people complain\u0026nbspof being turned away from prominent gay clubs for not looking or sounding “gay”\u0026nbspenough.I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim. I\u0026nbspcouldn’t find a way to allow all these identities to co-exist. One of my first forays into the gay clubbing scene in the early Noughties resulted in a memorable conversation with a fellow clubber, a young white gay man who felt propelled to ask how I,\u0026nbspas a gay, brown Muslim man, could be dancing to Kylie. It was this and many other confrontations like these that led me to delve into my identity.Chutney queens is\u0026nbspan affectionate umbrella term used to describe drag queens who adhere to a Bollywood inspired, culturally south Asian aesthetic. Surrounded by these gregarious clubbers I felt accounted for. I belonged. Such safe spaces exist out of necessity, the need to feel represented.\u0026nbspI have opened my own club night, ‘Disco Rani’, which is a monthly Bollywood and Banghra club night that functions as a safe space for a wide cross-section of Gaysians.Similarly, we have seen a growth in BAME\u0026nbspPrides and events that commemorate our differences, supported by Stonewall but frowned upon by the old guard that question its necessity and the\u0026nbspfragmentation of the LGBT community. The harsh reality is that more work needs to be done to increase visibility and representation of all the peoples that make up the LGBT community and until then these Prides are needed.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I could.LGBT activists\u0026nbspdemonstrate against the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of\u0026nbspSection 377, which bans gay sex in a law dating from India’s colonial era (AFPGetty)As annual Pride celebrations begin in earnest I reflect on the importance of such events. Prides are an essential part of our celebration as LGBTQ+ people and now more than ever we must continue to show up and not forget our history. Rights that are long fought for can as quickly be taken away.Visibility must continue, especially in the current climate of the Parkfield school protests and the debate of LGBT education. Such a debate highlights the fact that –\u0026nbspfor all the legal rights and privileges the LGBT community has acquired – more needs to be done. Same sex relationships deserve acknowledgement on equal footing to heteronormative relationships. Visibility is one way to ensure our presence. As Marsha P Johnson did and as Peter Tatchell and Janet Mock continue to do, so we must stand up and make ourselves heard.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Will the series be able to struggle on without him?\u0026nbspThe correct answer to that question is, of course:\u0026nbsp“Remind me, which one was Callum again?”\u0026nbspAs viewers became entangled in the Lucie-Joe-Tommy love triangle and other dramas, Callum seemed to discover his niche as the incredible shrinking islander – forgotten even while still nominally in the running.\u0026nbspLove Island’s moment in the sun is fast fadingWell now he’s gone, and we shall all have to find the strength to continue. It’s been an ordeal already, as we’ve just gone an entire 48 hours without Love Island. How many of us were reduced\u0026nbspto shaking our fists at the clouds on Saturday when we tuned into ITV2 only to discover the show had the night off? (Well, not me, because I was at a Cure concert, but you get the point.)Anyway, our long wait is finally over. With their first week of high-concept coupling behind them, the contestants, for their part, may feel they can leave their guard down and show more of their true selves.In Lucie’s case that will probably involve aggressively saying “bevy” over and over. She has another house-mate to practice her lingo on, too, in the shape of newcomer Danny Williams. So let’s all belt up for another helping of epic flirtation, bromantic banter and preening by the pool.Follow along with our Love Island\u0026nbsplive-blog below.Catch up on Friday\u0027s episode of Love Island hereHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Love Island live-blog, bringing you all the latest from the Spanish villa. Tonight\u0027s episode starts at 9pm –follow along with us here.\u0026nbspCallum, who had originally been paired with Amber, became the first Islander to leave the villa this series.He and Amber never demonstrated much chemistry and Callum didn\u0027t really bond with any of the other female Islanders, meaning he was left as the only single man following Friday\u0027s recoupling.In his leaving speech, Callum, who said he had come on the show to meet his future wife, expressed some disappointment, though he still had hope for the future.After being torn between Tommy and Joe for several episodes, Lucie\u0026nbspfinally made a choice between the two Islanders on Friday.\u0026nbspTo recap: Lucie was originally paired with Joe, who appeared\u0026nbspvery taken with her, but Tommy picked Lucie as his date after joining the villa, which stirred up trouble. Lucie\u0026nbspwent back and forth between the two and kissed both of them during the challenge on Friday.\u0026nbspDuring the recoupling, though, she picked Joe. Does this mean the love triangle has finally come to an end? We\u0027ll no doubt find out more tonight.Newcomer Molly-Mae seems to really like Tommy. They\u0026nbsphad quite the flirty chat in the villa\u0027s hot tub during Friday\u0027s episode and she picked Tommy during the recoupling.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHowever, she did express\u0026nbspinterest for Michael and Anton. So perhaps her head will be turned at some point tonight.\u0026nbspCurtis and Amy seem so smitten with each other you\u0027d be forgiven for forgetting they met five days ago. They\u0027re definitely the old couple of the villa (and have doled out rather wise advice to other Islanders on several occasions).\u0026nbspThere was potential\u0026nbsptrouble\u0026nbspwhen Molly-Mae asked Curtis to have a chat with her in the hot tub, but Curtis promptly told her how much he likes Amy.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the end, all was well, and Amy picked Curtis during the recoupling. The two remain fan favourites.Please allow the live-blog a moment to load.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It hopes that private industry can develop the space technologies of the future, and help with its plans to return to the Moon in 2024, taking the first ever woman and the first person in decades.The moon is shrinking and shaking, Nasa saysNasa hopes that the missions help test out and encourage future private missions into space, which could provide funding for further exploration in years to come.The space agency will keep using the ISS as a place for research and testing in low-Earth orbit, doing work that will help contribute towards its plans to head to the Moon, it said. But it will also work with the private sector to allow it to use the ISS to test technologies, train astronauts and encourage the development of the space economy, it said.Nasa will also help develop a whole host of private spacecraft, floating around above the Earth, that can serve as a home for people, Nasa said.The tourists\u0026nbsp– whom\u0026nbspNasa refers to as private astronauts – will go on missions of up to 30 days. While there they will perform duties that can include commercial and marketing activity, which will be limited by Nasa\u0027s rules.There can be two of those short-duration missions each year, Nasa said. They will go on privately funded, dedicated spaceflights that will use a US spacecraft, developed under Nasa\u0027s plan to encourage the private sector to build new spacecraft.The private astronauts will still have to pass Nasa\u0027s medical standards and the training procedures to ensure they are safe on board the ISS.Eventually, private companies could use floating habitations like the ISS to stop off at on their way to further destinations deeper in the solar system.Nasa\u0027s decision to open up the space station comes as a variety of companies start to offer the possibility of space tourism in the future. Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, for instance, will send a Japanese billionaire and eight artists around the Moon in a private mission slated for 2023.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium.

Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes. One misconception is that these will be special “high-speed”\u0026nbsppremium services with higher ticket prices for rich passengers. That isn’t true – these will be the ordinary journey times between those cities, integrated into the existing network.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.In the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance.

We expected it to sell for a little over estimate, but not five times.We are sharing the money with the farmer, who is also thrilled.”It was sold by Dix Noonan Webb, a Mayfair-based international coin, medal, banknote and jewellery specialist.Christopher Webb, director and head of the auction house\u0027s coin department, said: “I am delighted with the phenomenal price achieved in today’s sale.This is the most expensive coin that we have ever sold.As well as being one of the world’s most expensive Roman coins, it is the most money ever paid for one of Allectus.”There was fierce competition in the room, and on the internet and telephone, before the coin, one of only 24 aurei of Allectus known worldwide, was bought by a private collector over the phone.Allectus was the finance minister for the emperor Carausius who controlled both Britain and Gaul, which is now France and neighbouring countries such as Belgium and Luxembourg.Ancient Roman ‘hand of god’ discovered near Hadrian’s WallRoman-era rabbit bone reveals animal arrived much earlier than thoughtSecrets of horrific battle that gave birth to Roman Empire revealedWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe coins showing Allectus would only have been legal tender during his three years in power.The town of Deal in Kent has long been presumed to be the place where the invading Romans, led by Julius Caesar, first landed in Britain, in 55BC.However, archaeologists in 2017 argued that there was new evidence to show they had actually arrived at Pegwell Bay on the Kentish coastThe Romans\u0027 name for Dover was Dubris and the most distinct reminder of their presence in the town is the Roman Painted House.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Hunt said it was “unwise” for any candidate to pledge to leave by 31 October regardless of whether a deal has been secured\u0026nbsp- as frontrunner Boris Johnson has done -\u0026nbspas this might require calling a general election which would be “catastrophic” for the Tories.“If you say 31 October is a deadline, come what may, and parliament blocks no deal, the only way to deliver on that promise is to have an election and change parliament, and that would be catastrophic for the Conservative Party,” he said.He warned Tories against choosing a leader who would take an “ultra-hardline” approach to Brexit, as the EU would take an ultra-hardline stance in response.Asked for his view of Mr Johnson’s record as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt replied: “He was quite a Marmite character, of course, and there are European foreign ministers who found him difficult to deal with because of his views on Brexit.”He said he had been encouraged in private talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at last week’s D-Day commemorations by indications that she was ready to see the UK take a new approach to the Irish border issue.Boris Johnson threatens to withhold £39bn from EURuth Davidson backs Sajid Javid to be next PMRaab will not rule out suspending parliament to force no-deal BrexitShopping bills ‘could rise by £800 a year’ in no-deal Brexit“When talking to other European governments, what I hear the whole time is they want to do a deal with us if we approach it the right way,” he said.And he insisted the UK could make a success of Brexit: “We have been through far, far worse in our history and we can get through this and we can make a terrific success of it, and I think we will.”Environment secretary Michael Gove\u0026nbspsaid that he would be willing to extend Brexit talks for “weeks or days” beyond 31 October if a withdrawal deal was within grasp.But asked on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show if the UK could remain in the EU until early 2020 if he became prime minister, he replied: “No.”Mr Gove said he would ensure Brexit happened “at the earliest possible opportunity”.But he said: “I wouldn’t delay until the end of next year, but there is a clear choice. If we are on the cusp of a good deal and we are 95 per cent of the way there on 31 October, would it really make sense to junk that progress and say we are leaving without a deal.”He said it was an “irresponsible risk” for any leadership contender to make\u0026nbspit an absolute commitment to leave by the end of October, deal or no deal, as this was likely to\u0026nbspprecipitatie a no-confidence vote in the Commons and a general election which would be won by Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Javid is promising to spend “hundreds of millions of pounds” on a technological solution to the problem of the Irish border in order to be able to quit Europe with a deal based on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.Despite widespread doubts that the technology exists to police millions of movement across hundreds of border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Mr Javid insisted that a system could be introduced “within a couple of years” if both sides were willing to work together.He said that a successful withdrawal agreement would create a “mini economic boom in this country” which would pay for the equipment required.Sajid Javid says UK should pay Ireland hundreds of millions of pounds to solve Brexit border deadlock (Reuters)Mr Javid, who has won the endorsement of the Tory leader in Scotland Ruth Davidson for his leadership bid, is planning to slow down the rate at which the UK pays down its deficit if he becomes PM.He said this could free up £15-£25 billion a year to spend on priorities like schools, local government and crime.Mr Javid said be believed Britain was ready for a Muslim prime minister, and said it would be an advantage to the Conservatives to select a new leader who was seen as an “outsider”, not only because of his racial background but also his working-class upbringing.He said he was “privileged” to be the first member of an ethnic minority to serve in one of the “great offices of state”.Asked if his party was ready for a Muslim PM, he said: “I think the country – not just the Conservative Party – is ready for leaders in politics from all sorts of backgrounds.“When I compare Britain to so many other countries, there is no doubt in my mind that we are the most successful multi-racial democracy in the world.”Mr Javid said he had experienced racism as a child and young man, but not since entering Parliament.“As a child, sadly, many times – these are things you don’t forget, being called ‘Paki’, being attacked by National Front skinheads, and punching back a few times,” he said.He added: “Sometimes, I do think of myself as a bit of an outsider, not just because of race but my working-class background and the schools I went to.“Sometimes there’s a strong case to have an outsider as leader because it shakes people up … One of the best ways to get your message out there is to do something different, pick a bit of an outsider.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

Mr Grieve lost a no-confidence vote in his Buckinghamshire constituency by 182 votes to 131 in March, saying at the time that he appeared to be the victim of “an orchestrated and organised campaign” by Brexiteers.In a statement posted on Twitter, the chairman of the Beaconsfield\u0026nbspConstituency Conservative Association, Jackson Ng, said: “I understand that there are feelings of disappointment, anger and frustration from many of our membership.“Therefore, following this evening’s special general meeting and on behalf of our executive council, I have immediately written to our MP Dominic Grieve QC to formally request that he now submits a written application to us to seek his re-adoption as our parliamentary candidate for the next general election expected in 2022.”Local Tory member Dylan Kenny said in a tweet: “It was heartening that everyone spoke respectfully and with dignity. Dominic made an impassioned and highly intelligent speech. I am glad there was no animosity and the association should be proud of the conduct of this evening’s discourse.”Mr Grieve’s application for reselection as candidate would be subject to a secret ballot of the local association’s executive council. If he loses the vote, he can request a ballot of members in the constituency or put himself up against other candidates seeking to fight the seat.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would be using what was in my toolkit.”But leadership rival Michael Gove insisted that proroguing parliament to stop MPs from sitting in the days and weeks before the Halloween deadline for Brexit would be “wrong”.Created with Sketch.Who is standing to be the next Prime Minister?

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker will have to be approved by both member states and the European parliament.While one of the names being talked about will be familiar to those following Brexit, the three other front runners are less well-known in Britain:The inspiration for a TV dramaMargrethe Vestager\u0026nbsphas an impressive CV for the role (AP)Margrethe Vestager was the inspiration for the main character in Danish TV political drama Borgen – so there’s no doubt she would bring a bit of star power to the role. She’s the liberals’ candidate for the presidency, with the backing of Guy Verhofstadt – with Emmanuel Macron also naming her a possible rider.There’s never been a woman EU commission president, so Vestager would be the first – a former leader of the Danish Social Liberal party, an economy minister, and a competition commissioner, she has an impressive CV for the role.With the Danish social liberal party out of government, she may not be able to enjoy the fulsome backing from her home state that some other candidates can enjoy – sometimes a key fact at European Council meetings. But don’t rule her out.AFP)Michel Barnier is the best known in Britain as the chief Brexit negotiator of the European Commission. But he’s also been spending a lot of time recently effectively campaigning for the top job.\u0026nbspAs a Frenchman who hails in Angela Merkel’s political group, Barnier could be the compromise candidate to end the Franco-German tiff. He also has a high profile because of Brexit.He has government experience, and knows the ropes in Brussels: a former agriculture minister and EU Commissioner for the internal market. \u0026nbspWith the EU insistent that it’ll never reopen Brexit negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, Barnier’s job is basically done and he’s looking for a new challenge. Could that be leading the Commission?In March last year Manfred Weber voted against banning gay conversion therapy, unlike most of the MEPs in his party. But it clearly wasn’t a major issue for the European centre-right, because they made him their lead candidate going into the elections.Weber’s party won the European elections, so according to some people he should be the automatic next Commission president. He has Angela Merkel’s public backingBut he’s provoked opposition on the basis that he’s never held a government position he’s instead been in Brussels and Strasbourg serving as a senior MEP.\u0026nbspThe fact he is so close to Germany’s ruling party (he is a member) could also be an issue, in a union that is constantly wary of German domination. His chief critic is Emmanuel Macron, who publicly suggested he might not have the skills to be Commission president.\u0026nbspFrans Timmermans was once a conscript in the Dutch army charged with interrogating Russian prisoners of war – today he’s the centre-left’s candidate for the Commission presidency.\u0026nbspHis group didn’t top last month’s poll, but with no party having an overall majority, a ‘progressive alliance’ could give him a chance in the European parliament leg of the contest.Out of all the candidates, he has the most developed and distinctive programme: he wants an EU minimum wage, for instance, and a more developed social Europe.Currently Juncker’s deputy as first vice president, Timmermans knows the Commission inside-out, but he also has government experience: he was a foreign minister for the Netherlands’. Still stands a chance.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it hasn’t stopped since then: buoyed by the momentum of their new MEPs, ecologists are making further gains.In Germany, the latest poll shows the country’s Greens practically neck-and-neck with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, who have dominated the country’s politics for well over a decade. With the governing coalition facing a rough patch, there’s even talk that fresh early elections could put the ecologists in charge at the head of a centre-left alliance.Other countries are also seeing ecologists get in on power. In Finland, the Greens are a key part of the new governing coalition, formed on Thursday, and have even taken over the country’s foreign ministry. There are gains in places like Ireland, France and Belgium too. In Britain, they are doing as well as they have ever done in the polls for Westminster, fresh from doubling their MEPs last month.It’s worth a note of caution: public opinion can be fickle, and Green parties have surged before. Back in the 1989 European elections, Greens won 14 per cent of the vote in the UK. They didn’t quite get established as a major political force, but much of their policy and rhetoric was integrated into the big parties’ programmes out of fear they might be displaced.But there are good reasons to think that their politics will stick\u0026nbsparound this time, and that climate change might be getting the focus in our politics that it deserves – despite rows about Brexit dominating media coverage over the last few years.\u0026nbspGreens poised to overtake Angela Merkel’s conservatives in pollsThe German Greens will shape the future of all EuropeHow European newspapers reacted to the EU election resultsIn a way, the idea that “we don’t pay enough attention to climate change”\u0026nbsphas become a powerful political idea in itself – it is self evidently true, and a powerful recruiting tool for ecologist movements and green parties, who give the issue the time it deserves. \u0026nbspThe recent Extinction Rebellion protests\u0026nbspand associated climate change school strikes, which have sprung up across Europe – and play off this very idea – have massively raised public consciousness of environmental issues to never-before-seen levels.\u0026nbspA YouGov poll series of UK voters’ unprompted political concerns shows those mentioning the environment as an issue rising slowly and steadily from 2016 onwards, and then spiking after the Extinction Rebellion protests started in 2019 to 27 per cent. The spike surpassed a previous short-lived spike to 24 per cent during serious winter flooding and storms in 2014.If there are two things we can expect more of, it’s extreme weather and climate protests. If those things drive concern about the environment, that’s fertile soil for ecologist politics.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A participant dances while holding a large rainbow flag during the Athens Gay Pride.

In Britain, Labour has already made a Green New Deal, and similar programmes are being promoted by left-wing Democrats in the US without much interference from third parties. However that change comes about, it looks like concern about the climate is finally getting the kind of attention it needs in the developed world.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Internationally, he is doing well. We have no real need to find a new home,” he concluded.Elections aside, tensions between secular and religious communities have flared over the last few years and will continue to do so as the community expands, analysts predict.Haredi\u0026nbspJews during a demonstration against Israeli army conscription in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, in\u0026nbspNovember\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)The Haredim, according to the Israel Democracy Institute’s (IDI)\u0026nbsplatest report, make up 12 per cent of the country, but by 2065 will account for a third of Israel’s overall population.Just last month clashes between the Haredim and the security forces erupted in Jerusalem because the Eurovision finals were held on a Saturday, which violates the Sabbath.Haredi protesters regularly come to blows with the police over shops, shopping malls and car parks being open on a Saturday. \u0026nbspThis has sparked rival clashes between the police and angry secular people\u0026nbspwho have held their own rallies in Ashkelon and Ashdod, against the closure of shops for religious reasons over the weekend. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUnderscoring these tensions is the accusation by critics that the ultra-Orthodox are a massive burden on the state.They say the ultra-Orthodox have large impoverished families that often rely on state stipends, while contributing less to the labour force and so paying less taxes.Shaarim neighbourhood in\u0026nbspMarch\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Around half of Haredi men of working age are unemployed, according to the IDI, as many choose to opt for full-time study of the Torah instead. Only 10 per cent of non-Orthodox men of working age are jobless.Although the Haredi employment rate is steadily increasing, those that do work often have low-paid part-time jobs. Nearly 50 per cent of the ultra-Orthodox live in poverty.The other sticking point is the draft. Since Israel’s founding, members of the ultra-Orthodox who are in full-time religious study are allowed to defer and then ultimately secure lifelong exemption from military conscription.Orthodox leaders fear full integration into the military, where men and women mix, will undermine a religious lifestyle.In recent years there has been around a 50 per cent increase in numbers of young\u0026nbspHaredi\u0026nbspmen signing up. There are\u0026nbspmore than 7,000 Haredi soldiers currently enlisted in the army, according to a Knesset Research and Information Centre\u0026nbsp(RIC) report from last year.Shachar Kachol\u0026nbspultra-Orthodox Jewish unit prays at a synagogue\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)But many believe it is unfair that the Haredi are not punished for avoiding military service.\u0026nbspOver the last few years there have been fierce battles over changes to the conscription law, including the introduction of Haredi enlistment quotas and sanctions for a failure to meet them.That battle over that wording came to a head as Netanyahu was building his coalition.According to Lieberman\u0026nbspthe Haredi parties, who hold a total of 16 seats, would not budge on his demand that quotas be increased.But Haredi members of the Israeli’s parliament the Knesset (MKs) say this is not the case, and Lieberman’s position was not an ideological one but a personal one.“There was no real negotiation with us\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit wasn’t a case of he said no, and we said yes, it was a game,” Mr\u0026nbspPindrus told The Independent.“I don’t think it has anything to do with the ultra-Orthodox parties, this was an argument between Mr Lieberman and Mr Netanyahu, who he hates.”Yisrael Beiteino party leader Avigdor Lieberman last month\u0026nbsp(Getty)A senior source with Shas, another main ultra-Orthodox party, echoed his words.“MK Avigdor Lieberman wanted to bring down Netanyahu,” the source said.“Shas members are convinced that the draft law is not the reason for the elections, but rather purely personal reasons were behind Lieberman not joining the Netanyahu government.”Both parties also denied\u0026nbspthat they were interested in imposing ultra-conservative values on Israel but rather their aim in the upcoming elections was to “keep the status quo”.It is noticeable that a recent call for the country to be run by religious law was not made by ultra-Orthodox politicians but by the United Right, an alliance of far-right parties.As Rabbi Pfeffer pointed out, the Haredim would not “touch such an explosive subject”.No one can make a right-wing coalition without the\u0026nbspHaredimThat said, with a powerful number of seats, the ultra-Orthodox will likely be kingmakers in the coming elections.“No one can make a right-wing coalition without the Haredim,” Rabbi Pfeffer concluded.“It is difficult to see a coalition that won’t have them as a tipping point.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch. That’s the sting of vinegar in their eyes. It’s the only remedy for their arrogance. Folks, keep squirting. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest must do so now.THERE is a lesson for some younger Royals from Donald Trump’s memorable State Visit.We have no ideathe Queen, Charles or Camilla liked him. That’s the point.For three days they rolled out the red carpet, charmed the world’s most powerful man and treated him and his we to the pomp and pageantry we excel at.The President loved it. And the older Royals, regardless of personal likes or dislikes, honoured his country and his historic role with grace and humour.They did their job, and put to shame the tantrums of the Left and our staggeringly unprofessional Commons Speaker.The result  Trump has never felt closer to our country.Barack Obama sneered that we would be “at the back of the queue” for a trade dealwe dared to vote Leave.His Remainer fans loved stating it as fact.But we did vote Leave, and Obama’s successor can’t wait now to get cracking on it.Maybe someone should prosecute those Remainers for “lying”. It’s all the rage.WE rarely agree with Philip Hammond. But he’s right about the folly of blindly committing to “net zero” emissions within  years.Every gas boiler and cooker, and every petrol and diesel vehicle, scrapped.A nationwide blizzard of charging points. Far less meat in our diet. And much .We doubt the Chancellor’s £trillion cost estimate — but evenit’s half, that’s money we cannot spend on health, schools or police.What is the Government doing to convince the public this is a good idea We all want a cleaner world, but what happens when services are slashed to fund it The eco lobby predicts a huge pricewe FAIL to act. But UK emissions are a minuscule fraction of the global total.Voters won’t back this revolution unless every other major country — many far worse polluters than us — does too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some people have suggested reducing the allowance for people living in London and increasing the allowance for people outside London, others have suggested just an addition.”A House of Lords spokesperson said: There are no proposals for re-introducing a separate overnight allowance that would allow Peers to recoup the cost of staying in London to attend the House.We will not be adopting the system in the House of Commons to allow direct recuperation of hotel costs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nazis enslaved Europe until a generation gave their all to wipe that evil creed from the earth. Nazis — real Nazis! — were waiting for those men and boys when they landed on those hellish beaches  years ago.As our Queen welcomed the democratically elected leader of the country that fought by our side in Normandy, Corbyn made a great show of boycotting Trump’s state banquet but attending the anti-Trump protest.And Corbyn never looked more like a -year-old student. The Americans are not simply our oldest allies, Jeremy, the Americans are our biggest trading partners. Who are we going to trade withyou ever get to  Downing Street  Venezuela  Palestine Jeremy Corbyn made a massive misjudgement by so flamboyantly snubbing Trump. And I suspect that somewhere in his mediocre old mind, Jezza knows it. That is why he later begged Trump for a meeting, which the President took great delight in denying.The Queen showed Corbyn how it should be done. Whatever Her Majesty’s personal feelings about this brash American President — and she seems to quite like him — she welcomed Trump with grace and dignity.The Queen’s treatment of her American guest was not simply good diplomacy. It was good manners. And the British care about good manners. To insult the American President as we honoured the American boys who never went home was, more than anything, just so unforgivably RUDE. Does Jeremy Corbyn know nothing of the British people Millions find it mind-boggling that he can happily break bread with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but refuses to share a state dinner with the President of the United States.Corbyn has spent so long in the self-loathing sewer of the hard Left that he has lost sight of a simple truth — most British people have a deep and profound love for this country.This week was a reminder that we have so much to be proud of. A nation looked at that dwindling band of brothers who stormed the beaches of Normandy and felt nothing but gratitude for their sacrice.There is an instinctive patriotism in our people that Corbyn and his Marxist muppets simply do not understand or share. Labour may have clung on to their seat in Peterborough by the skin of Corbyn’s dentures, but the virtue-signalling old booby never looked less like a potential Prime Minister.The oldest student in town does not look ready to form a government. He looks ready for a care home. The compulsive halo-polishing goes down a storm on social media, Mr Corbyn. It just doesn’t work in the real world.If the day ever comes when Corbyn is drooling on the doorstep of  Downing Street, is he only going to do business with people he approves of  How lonely he will be!GEORGE MICHAEL was the most generous of men. When we wrote his autobiography together, we innocently shook hands on splitting the profits -. But a ghost writer does not usually get the same payday as the global superstar with his name on the front cover.When we wrote our book, George was coming off the back of his first solo album, Faith, and was possibly the biggest star in the world. His American managers confidently assured my agent that our - deal was never going to happen. But it did – because George Michael insisted on it.He had given his word and we had shaken hands. George didn’t care about money. He cared about friendship.  So it was interesting to see how George’s last will and testimony ided his £.million fortune.Among those included are George’s -year-old dad, Kyriacos, his sisters Melanie and Yioda, and his friends Shirlie Kemp and David Austin. Those who didn’t make the cut included his lovers Kenny Goss and Fadi Fawaz, and his old Wham! buddy, Andrew Ridgeley.But Kenny and Fadi enjoyed the good le at George’s side for many years while Andrew has a joint songwriting credit on Careless Whisper, which has been worth around £million in royalties. Not bad, as Andrew was never particularly known for his songwriting genius.George probably felt he had taken good care of Kenny, Fadi and Andrew in le. George could be stubborn, self-destructive and self-obsessed. But he was a beautul man. And he had the biggest heart in the world.THEY are all queuing up to kick Anthony Joshua while he is down. Tyson Fury initially made sympathetic noises when Joshua got battered on his American debut by roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr, a - underdog who resembles Homer Simpson’s body double.But now the Gypsy King has joined the sadistic joy in Joshua’s humiliation and recommends AJ, “never shows his face in public again”. Madison Square Garden was a catastrophe for Joshua.He was beaten up by a chubby chops who was such a late booking that his name did not even appear on the tickets.  But Ruiz was always more than a Snickers addict. Before Joshua, he had fought  times and only lost once. Ruiz was never going to be a walkover for Joshua.But AJ should have found a way to beat him. And such is the brutal nature of boxing that Joshua now needs to win a rematch with Ruiz Jrhe is to salvage his career.Joshua seemed strangely off in New York, distracted and uncertain, absent-mindedly pushing out his gum shield during the ring walk, weirdly smiley after the ref waved off the fight.  But Joshua has been a great advertisement for British boxing.And there is no shame in losing a boxing match. Muhammad Ali lost five times. Floyd Mayweather never lost. Now you tell me – who is the greater man SIOBAHN PRIGENT is the woman seen screaming “Nazi scum!” at a lone Trump supporter, then cackling with sadistic delight when the mob splatters the POTUS fan with a milkshake.Some social media users say that it is wrong to mention Prigent’s generous girth when commenting on her repulsive behaviour.

She had been trying to die for a long time. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands.Noa asked the Levenseinde end-of-le clinic in The Hague two years agoshe could be considered for euthanasia or assisted suicide but they — rightly — refused.She told De Gelderlander newspaper in December: “They consider that I am too young to die. They think I should finish my trauma treatment and that my brain must first be fully grown.That lasts until your st birthday. It’s broken me, because I can’t wait that long.” No one, surely, could read those words without agreeing that yes, she was too young to die. Right Most of us have enough le experience to know that, no matter how bad things are, or seem to be, dark clouds can hang around — but they do sht.Things change. Hopelessness gives way to hope. And dark often eventually becomes light. But Noa didn’t believe it.There is no doubt at all that her young le had been incredibly dficult. She’d had extensive treatment for depression and anorexia, and had tried to kill herself several times.She had been sexually assaulted at the age of  and raped at . She was so traumatised she didn’t want to live any more and, after repeated hospital stays, decided to stop treatment earlier this year.In what she referred to as a “sorrowful last post” on Instagram, Noa said she had “stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it has been decided to let me go, because my suffering is unbearable”.A hospital bed was set up in her parents’ home and last week she refused all food and fluids after her parents and doctors reportedly agreed not to force-feed her.It is pretty much impossible for most of us to understand quite how desperate, resigned, despairing this woman’s parents must have been to have facilitated their daughter’s voluntary death.They must all have felt sure that there was no alternative. But it’s also hard to resist the urge to challenge that notion.There are so many examples of people — from Maya Angelou to Malala Yousafzai to JK Rowling — who have overcome adversity to make a huge success of their lives.I know many people who have overcome very dficult, challenging and dark times as teenagers who have gone on to create fulfilling and happy relationships and live rewarding and successful lives.I think it’s fair to say that, as a teenager, it’s impossible to imagine the future. It’s all too easy to be so mired in the dficulties of the present that you feel you will be stuck there for ever.Without in any way diminishing Noa’s suffering, I do know there were things that felt to me like a crisis at  that I barely now recall.I would take the view that it’s possible to get over even the most dficult challenges — evenit involves temporary defeat, sometimes total failure, it is how you react that sets your path.The big question that this story raises is, should we be allowed to choose to die  Ultimately, I think the answer to that is yes, we should. But does anyone know enough about living at the age of  to choose to die  I don’t think so.IT IS striking that this week a new Lancet study confirmed what many of us already know: Self-harm among young women and girls is rising at an “alarming” rate.What on earth is happening to our young people  Our young women in particular. What is the cause of this epidemic of self-loathing, self-harm, self-destruction When I was a teenager I had problems, sure, but nothing that would have driven me to harm myself.But so many parents now have to deal with their children hurting themselves as a daily reality – and my heart goes out to them. I don’t have the solution. But I do have a few theories about how to help kids thrive.Sport is really, really good for kids. It builds self-esteem and gives them another focus than themselves, their bodies, and whether they measure up to the people they follow on Instagram.Social media can be a force for good. But it can make young people feel really bad too. Help your kids to find other outlets, hobbies and passions.Talk to your kids about everything. And listen. Be un-shockable. My daughter – for better or worse! – still tells me everything. No subjects are taboo and they never have been or will be.If you accept your child for who they are, you will help them to be their authentic selves, rather than trying to be someone they are not. That is one of the greatest gts you can give them.I CONFESS to a tear in my eye watching the moment when Nicolas Mahut’s son rushed on court to console his father about losing to Leonardo Mayer at the French Open.Their hug was so heartfelt, and incredibly sweet and touching.It was a great reminder that relationships matter so much more than winning ever will.DID you hear the one about the woman who sold her husband’s £, football memorabilia for a fiver after seeing him cheating Shelly Cohen, , from Warrington, Cheshire, was sick of husband Paul putting his love of the beautul game before their relationship.When a friend texted her to say she’d seen her husband at a Manchester City match with another woman, that was it.She gathered together his prized memorabilia collection, which dates back  years, and listed it for sale on her husband’s OnBuy account.Then she flogged his £, memorabilia collection for a fiver. All I can say is: OUCH!SEEING all the state banquets this week has reminded me about my own visits to Buckingham Palace.I’ve been to white-tie events there as well as an intimate lunch with the Queen.I’ve also had dinner at Winfield House, which belongs to the American ambassador, in the same room that Trump had dinner.And they really are momentous occasions. I mean, just getting ready is fairly momentous.Although for most of them, despite the best-laid plans, I ended up rushing home from work and throwing something on.Some things I remember, in no particular order – after dinner, I really wanted to go to the toilet. But no one is allowed to leave until the Queen does, so I had to just hold on, and on, and on.I practised my curtsey before I went. That’s because when I was given my CBE by Prince William I was given so many instructions about how many steps to take to the left, right, and backwards that when the time came to curtsey I ended up doing a SQUAT!So I thought a YouTube tutorial might be a good idea. When our last course arrived – a plate with a bowl plus a cloth – I didn’t know what it was.Luckily, I was sitting next to the delightful Lord Chamberlain, Earl William Peel, who told me that the bowl was to wash fruit and the cloth was to dry it.Lastly, the Queen really is the world’s most professional conversationalist.She knew about the Olympic Stadium and football, and talked about both of them as though she was really interested.Despite all the pomp and ceremony, I was made to feel absolutely comfortable. But I definitely had more than a moment of thinking, “Pinch me, I’m at Buckingham Palace!”There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s trip was a great success. But my main take home from everything I saw was, what I wouldn’t give to have Melania’s wardrobe! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wouldn’t wish the emotional distraught this has cause me on my worst enemy.”Mengert believes that the agents violated her constitutional rights when they allegedly strip-searched her.Her lawsuit states that she suffered emotional distress: “In particular, during the incident, Mengert experienced racing heart, shortness of breath, uncontrollable shaking, nausea and panic.”She wants, “injunctive relief requiring the [TSA] to direct its employees that they may not strip search passengers to clear apparent feminine hygiene products without the further heightened suspicion required by law.”Civil rights lawyer Jonathan Corbett, representing Mengert, explained that she had “hugged her grandchildren goodby after a Mother’s Day visit in Tulsa… and given that she is a frequent flyer for work and has PreCheck status, expected an uneventful security search.“Instead, two screeners at Tulsa airport decided to humiliate her.

No one should be violated in this manner.

He is one of a number of candidates in the Tory leadership race insisting they could somehow succeed where Theresa May failed in striking a better Brexit deal with Brussels.The European Union has repeatedly said it would not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, but Michael Gove - seeking to get his campaign back on course after revelations over his past cocaine use - said changing the prime minister changes everything. Boris Johnson would use the £ billion orce bill to secure a better deal, refusing to hand over the cash unless improved terms were on offer. And Sajid Javid said he would offer to spend hundreds of millions on a technological solution to the Irish border question. While hard Brexiteer Esther McVey followed Dominic Raab in saying she would prorogue Parliament to leave the EU without a dealshe became Prime Minister. She accused MPs trying to prevent Brexit of tearing up  years of history. The former work and pensions secretary said it would not be her priority to suspend sittings in the House of Commons in the run-up to the October  deadline, but said she would be willing to use all the tools at our disposalshe won the race to replace Theresa May.  Brusselsapos chief negotiator Michel Barnier has stressed that the deal struck with Mrs May remained the only one on the table and a new prime minister will not change the problem.    But Mr Gove told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show he would have a smart negotiating team led by myself and other politicians, rather than officials, explaining to the European Union what needs to change in order to make sure we honour the referendum result. We would have a full stop to the backstop, we would also have a clear approach to making sure that we have a Canada-style free trade agreement. He added: Changing the prime minister changes everything. We can get a better deal. Mr Gove confirmed that he would be prepared to delay Brexit beyond the October  deadline for days or weeksa deal was within reach. Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt claimed the German Chancellor told him Brussels would look at any solutions the UK puts forward to solve the Northern Irish border issue. Asked on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge On Sunday whether he was confident of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, he said: If youaposre asking me as someone who has done deals all their le aposis there a deal here apos, yes, there is. Finding that deal is going to mean approaching the EU with the right kind of person. If we go in with an ultra hardline approach, we will get an ultra hardline response. Mr Javid said offering to pay for changes at the border would secure co-operation from Dublin and Brussels. You donapost need a magic solution for this, the solution exists. Weaposve done the homework on this, the Home Secretary, who has ministerial responsibility for the UKaposs borders, told Sky News. Mr Johnson said he would scrap the backstop - something the EU has so far refused to do - and would settle the Irish border issue only when Brussels is ready to agree to a future relationship. The £ billion settlement would only be paid when there is greater clarity about the way forward, he told the Sunday Times. I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write the entire cheque before having a final deal, he said. In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.   In his first major interview of the campaign, the bookmakersapos favourite said only he could defeat the twin threat posed by the leaders of the Brexit Party and Labour - comparing them to the sea monsters from Greek mythology which troubled Odysseus.I truly believe only I can steer the country between the Scylla and Charybdis of Corbyn and Farage and on to calmer water. This can only be achieved by delivering Brexit as promised on October  and delivering a One Nation Tory agenda. Rory Stewart said Mr Johnsonaposs comments on the money and the Irish border were undignied and irresponsible. The former foreign secretary has picked up support from James Cleverly, who pulled out of the leadership race and from prominent Brexiteer Steve Baker who had been considering his own run for the post. He also picked up endorsements from Cabinet ministers James Brokenshire, Chris Grayling and Alun Cairns, and former international development secretary Priti Patel. Mr Javid received a boost with an endorsement from Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.

The Environment Secretary told the newspaper he wanted to introduce a pro-business economic plan. My economic plan is driven by the need to increase investment, productivity and wages across the country, with a special focus on helping those areas and regions where productivity is lower, he wrote.  It would mean reducing the regulations which hold business back, cutting and reforming taxes - such as business rates - which put pressure on small businesses and undermine our high streets, using the opportunity of le outside the EU to look to replace VAT with a lower, simpler, sales tax, he added. VAT is required as part of being a member of the European single market.

Leader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable said: Michael Gove is clearly on par with other candidates in the Tory leadership race who have put forward equally ludicrous proposals. Any remaining claims the Conservatives had for having some fiscal responsibility has gone down the drain. VAT is an essential part of our tax system which raises vast amounts of revenue. Due to the zero rate exemption low income families are protected from the worst effects of the consumption tax. There is a strong argument for raising the threshold due to the bureaucracy it creates for small businesses, but this is a very dferent matter from scrapping it entirely.

Andi had to be airlted to hospital where surgeons had to screw rods into his leg. Lara, originally from Cambridge, said: I was frozen with fear when we first saw the bears. I remembered you’re supposed to punch a bear in the eye, so I yelled that. The bear turned around and left him.  Andi recalled the scene and said the mother bear appeared only a metre away from him.

Mariyka’s amazing story did not feature in the recent TV hype over the Soviet atomic power station, but she is said to be a symbol of Chernobyl renaissance following the disastrous explosion. She hit the headlines  years ago when she became the first and only baby to be born and brought up living close to blitzed reactor number four. But she has not been seen in the media for years.  Now a -year- old student at a leading higher education institution in Ukraine’s capital Kiev, she was tracked down by the Sunday Express and said: “I am doing well, I am working. “I’m providing for myself. This is it.” When she was born in , the Ukrainian authorities sought to hide the “embarrassment” of her arrival to a family of Chernobyl workers living illegally in the -mile exclusion zone.    Her parents refused to leave the zone because the authorities offered them no alternative housing. But they were harassed and accused of “murdering” their daughter. She swam in a river where fish - which her father Mikhail caught to feed the family - sent Geiger counters bleeping wildly, says the newspaper. She drank milk from a cow fed on Chernobyl pastures irradiated by the nuclear explosion.  Her mother Lydia Sovenko was forced to deny rumours over her daughter’s health. If people think she is a mutant, or has two heads, they are quite wrong,” she said in one interview. She is a lovely child who is absolutely healthy as far as we can see.” Today Mariyka does not wish to highlight her past as she funds her studies working at a fashionable bar. She really doesnapost care about being unique through being born in Chernobyl, said a friend.  In fact, knowing that she is the only child who was born here after the explosion, and who grew up in Chernobyl, is rather painful for her. “She sees it as a stigma. Her health and success - confirmed by her mother and friends - comes as the nature of Chernobyl is fighting back against the appalling nuclear decimation it suffered  years ago. Wildle is teeming in the area with elk, deer, wild boar and wolves thriving as well as rare wild birds and flowers, some of them from the Red Book.

Tanya Marston, , was rushed back to hospital for treatment after she had become infected with listeria, a deadly bacterium which causes food poisoning. The mum-of-one ate chicken mayonnaise, ham and cheese sandwiches during a month-long stay at William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent, where she was being treated for Crohn’s disease. But one day after being discharged, the charity worker suffered a high temperature.Blood tests had showed listeria was in her body. I’m so grateful my temperature spiked. If it hadn’t, I’d have gone home without any blood test and the listeria might not have been spotted in time. I could have died, Ms Marston told Mail on Sunday.    Since the mumaposs scare, Public Health Englandhas announced listeria had appeared in six seriously ill in-patients. Three of the iniduals, who were being treated at hospitals in Manchester and Liverpool, died. And all those who fell ill had eaten the sandwiches prepared by Staffordshire-based firm The Good Food Chain, which supplies  of  NHS hospital trusts across England. The primary source has been traced to North Country Cooked Meats from Salford, Greater Manchester, which supplies meat to The Good Food Chain.  Dr Paul Stevens, medical director at William Harvey, told Ms Marston that medics believed her illness was linked to a cluster of listeria cases in northwest England. The official letter of apology from Dr Stevens said genetic testing has confirmed that the type of listeria [found in her blood] was identical to that already isolated from sandwiches supplied to our caterers by The Good Food Chain.This obviously makes it most likely that you acquired the bug from sandwiches given to you by the hospital.  But Ms Marston, who lives in Ashford, added: It looks like health officials have tried to play this outbreak down. If they are being evasive, that makes me a bit angry. Listeria causes listeriosis, which typically causes vomiting, diarrhoea, chills and other symptoms. But more serious complications can develop in those with weakened immune systems, babies, the elderly and pregnant women.

Mohammed Abdul Mossabir and his family say they waited six months for repairs, causing them untold misery. Water dripped constantly into the bedroom where Mr Mossabir, slept with his we Salma Begum and their four youngest children, Mizan, seven, Nahid, five, Nabid, three and Halima,  months. The leak became so bad they had to stop using the bedroom in the Birmingham flat.    The familyaposs plight was revealed by Saidul Haque Saeed, lead organiser of Citizens UK Birmingham, who said he was alerted when a case worker from partner charity Aspire  Succeed visited the family. Mr Saeed said: It is really distressing. The space they have is very limited anyway, without this.

He is constantly worried living here could trigger another heart attack and kill him, then what might happen to the children and his we  The repairs were completed this week after the charity got involved to help the family raise concerns with the council. During an occupational therapy assessment a year ago, Mr Mossabir was informed he was a medical priority for a ground floor flat or house because of his health needs, which also includes a paralysed left arm.    The charity worker added: There are nine of them living in this small three-bedroomed flat at the top of a block of flats and there is no lt - it is far from ideal for an ill person. But they are still waiting. To add to their misery the roof above the main bedroom started leaking several months ago. |They were uncertain how to get help - they asked for a repair which never happened, and the leak and crack in the bedroom got worse and grew bigger. Dad was initially lying under the leak so the kids could sleep but the leak got so bad they had to stop using the room he was worried the roof might come down on them, he added. Birmingham City Council said they acted immediately they learned of the leaking roof on May . In response to the claims, Birmingham City Council said it had no record of a complaint about the leak until last month. We received the original complaint on May  andwere made safe on the same day.  The spokesman said Mr Mossabir is bidding for alternative accommodation but his search has been limited to two geographical areas and properties with up to five bedrooms, which are in very short supply. The spokesman added: Mr Mossabir submitted a change of circumstances form with supporting medical evidence attached in order to move up to a higher priority banding on the housing list. However, assessment officers were unable to read these supporting documents and requested that legible copies be sent. To date these have not been received.

The staff member noted his BMW registration plate which was traced to his home address, where he was arrested less than three hours after the offence. He denied the offence during police interviews and refused to answer any questions, but later admitted to the act at Birmingham Crown Court. Waltho has been jailed for  months for indecent exposure.

Matilda Dalley was stabbed by the used needle as it was hidden between two seats on a Stagecoach  bus travelling between Grimsby and Cleethorpes. She was with her three stepsisters Courtney Burr, , Aimee Burr, , and Keira Burr, nine, when she reported feeling a sharp stab. Courtney said: “We got on the Cleethorpes bus – number  – and when Matilda sat down, she said she felt a ‘sharp stab’. “We didn’t think it was anything to worry about – just a feather or something – but she started crying and so Aimee checked the seat.  “She found a needle hidden between two bus seats and under a bus ticket.” Courtney and Aimee managed to take the needle out of the seats but pricked themselves too while doing so. “I handed the needle over to the bus driver and he just said ‘Thanks, sorry about that’. He didn’t askwe’d been pricked,” said Courtney. Matilda’s mum Nikki Dalley, from Immingham, said: “I was in a complete panic. They’d been back around an hour and Courtney said Matilda had been stabbed by a needle on the bus. “I had a look and she had two marks on her bum. Courtney was also pricked on the thumb and Aimee on the finger when trying to pull out the needle.”  The girls were taken to Grimsby’s Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital accident and emergency department and underwent injections for hepatitis B as a precaution. Nikki said: “I took them straight to AE and they were seen straight away. They all had blood tests and all underwent a hepatitis B injection. “They will have to have another one of these in another four weeks’ time and then another one after that. The horried mum explained how hepatitis B can survive in a needle for four days, meaning there is a likelihood her daughters have caught the infection. “It’s a waiting game to see whether anything shows up. We’ve been told it could be up to nine months until something shows up.” Nikki’s initial warning was shared more than  times on Facebook and received some  comments and  reactions. She is now urging bus users to check their seats and surrounding area for needles or other harmful objects. Nikki said used needles are often abandoned in parks and children, being children will touch them without knowing the danger in doing so. She outlined a procedure she was told to follow in the event of someone being pricked. It consists in squeezing the area until it bleeds and pour some water, preferably salt water, over it before cleaning it up with a paper towel. One should then put a plaster on it and rush to AE. The mum added: “I wasn’t aware of this procedure at the time butI was, it could have made all the dference. I just hope we get the all clear.”  A Stagecoach spokesperson said: We are very concerned to hear of this incident and our thoughts are with the little girl and her mum. “It is totally irresponsible for anyone to discard a needle on one of our buses, which they must know is likely to cause a danger to other people. “All of our buses are fitted with CCTV, which can be used in evidence to prosecute iniduals engaged in antisocial behaviour. “Thankfully, incidents of this nature are extremely rare and bus travel remains one of the safest forms of road transport. “However, should anyone find any potentially dangerous items left by passengers on our buses they should immediately report it to the driver so that appropriate action can be taken. Bus drivers in Grimsby and Cleethorpes are in radio contact with supervisory staff who can quickly provide emergency assistance.

The former actress, writer, humanitarian - and by her own admission pretty good cook - is, what many believe, redefining what it means to be a royal. Before she was thrust into the spotlight as -year-old Harryaposs future we, she had already forged her own identity as one of the stars of the TV series, Suits. The -year-old regularly documented her le with her now-defunct blog, The Tig, as well as her Instagram account where she shared snaps of her travels and gave fans a glimpse inside her impeccably designed home.    The former orcee, who welcomed her first baby with Harry on May , doesnapost have an aristocracy-laden family tree either. She enjoyed a fairly typical upbringing having been born and raised in Los Angeles by a free-spirited yoga-loving clinical therapist for a mum - who nicknamed her aposFlowerapos - and hardworking television lighting director for a father. Here are some of the ways the Duchess of Sussex has redefined what it means to be a royal and put her own stamp on Royal Family protocol - from her clothing to behaviour.  Upbringing Meghan was born Rachel Meghan Markle on August  in  at Canoga Park in Los Angeles, Calornia in the US. Her mother, Doria Ragland, and father, Thomas Markle, met in the late s on the set of a soap opera where Thomas was a lighting director and Doria was a temp. I like to think he was drawn to her sweet eyes and her Afro, plus their shared love of antiques, Meghan previously said. Whatever it was, they married and had me. They moved into a house in The Valley in LA, to a neighbourhood that was leafy and affordable.    Meghan admitted that as a Calornia girl she lived by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados. As a youngster, the importance of goodwill and appreciation were also instilled in her. Dad Thomas, now , grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania where Christmas stockings were stuffed with oranges, and dinners consisted of tins of Spam and potatoes. And as Meghan grew up, he taught her the importance of kindness and they would buy turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving. They would deliver meals to patients in hospice care, donate spare change to those asking for it, as well as offering a simple hug, smile or pat on the back to those who needed it.  And when Thomas won ,on the lottery in , Thomas used part of it to pay for Meghanaposs private school fees so she would have the best education. Her upbringing was in stark contrast to that of other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Diana who was born into one of the UKaposs many noble families - the Spencers. A number of iniduals across multiple generations have gone on to become knights, dukes, earls and barons. Dianaaposs father John Spencer was known as Viscount Althorp until he was honoured with the title th Earl Spencer following the death of his father in . He was also a member of the House of Lords. Dianaaposs mother Frances Shand Kydd was the daughter of Maurice Roche, th Baron Fermoy and a close friend of King George VI. Kate Middleton was also born into a wealthy family with ties to the British aristocracy. Sheaposs a orcee Meghan was previously married to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson. The pair tied the knot in  in Jamaica but split two years later, citing irreconcilable dferences. Royal correspondent Ashley Pierson said in an interview: They were together for seven years, married for two. The problem with the marriage was the distance.    As soon as they married she got the gig on Suits and she was in Toronto and he was in LA. The relationship just didn’t last. The last orcee to marry into royalty was Wallis Simpson, the twice-married American actress who stole King Edwardaposs heart and prompted him to abdicate so he could be with her. There was also controversy in the Royal Family when Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister, wanted to marry orced Peter Townsend. She later decided not to pursue the relationship. Public displays of affection with Harry Meghan and husband Harry are frequently photographed showing their affection for each other while out and about during public engagements. The pair are not shy about kissing, holding hands, touching each otheraposs knees or putting an arm around the other - just like a normal loved-up couple. Whereas Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William are more reserved and are rarely seen wrapping their arms around each other.  They refrain from touching and while there is no official rule restricting PDA, royal etiquette expert Myka Meier believes this is because theyaposre working as representatives of the British monarchy. Myka told People: Technically, the couple are working representatives of the British Monarchy. The couple are likely to show very little PDA,any, to remain professional during their designated roles abroad. However Harry and Meghan canapost seem to keep their hands off each other. Meanwhile, embracing royals is usually off-limits for both security reasons and out of respect for their positions, but kind Meghan has been spotted dishing out hugs to fans. Clothing When Meghan and Harry stepped out for the official photocall after announcing their engagement, the Duchess chose an elegant white belted wrap coat and bottle-green dress. But she bared her legs and decided to go sans-tights, something which is said to be a big no-no. Members of Britainaposs most famous family are expected to wear nude stockings with skirts and dresses, according to royal expert Victoria Arbiter.    You never see a royal without their nude stockings. Meghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesnapost look like she was wearing tights or stockings, Arbiter told INSIDER. I would say thataposs really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires. Meghan later posed in a gorgeous black Ralph  Russo gown, reported to cost £,, which featured sheer fabric - something the Queen is also claimed not to approve of as it is considered a bit risque. The Duchess also has a very modern dress sense and opts for dark nail polish, despite the Queen rumoured to prefer royals to sport nude shades on their nails. Her heritage Meghan is a proud biracial woman and has always embraced her roots, despite being queried over aposwhat she isapos. She was born to an African-American mum and Caucasian dad. She previously said: Being ‘ethnically ambiguous’, as I was pegged in the [acting] industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role. Morphing from Latina when I was dressed in red, to African American when in mustard yellow my closet filled with fashionable frocks to make me look as racially ied as an Eighties Benetton poster.  Sadly, it didn’t matter: I wasn’t black enough for the black roles and I wasn’t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn’t book a job. She added: While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identication, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman. Meghan and Harryaposs son Archie, seventh in line to the throne, is the first biracial half-American and half-British member of the Royal Family. He is the third biracial member of the Royal Family. His heritage has been described as monumental” by Tessy Ojo, chief executive of the Diana Award, the charity established in honor of Princess Diana. She told PEOPLE magazine: “Like Harry and Meghan’s wedding, it changes the landscape in terms of bringing visibility around race and inclusion. Opinionated Meghan has made no secret of the fact she is a feminist and is not afraid to speak her mind. She was  when she was so outraged by a sexist TV advert she was moved to write letters to movers and shakers to make a change. It marked the beginning of her campaigning. She previously revealed: “I was in my classroom at Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse and a commercial came on for a popular dish washing liquid. The tagline of the campaign said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’. The boys in my classroom yelled out, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong. In the kitchen’.  My little freckled face became red with anger. I went home and wrote letters to powerhouse feminist attorney Gloria Allred to a host of a kids’ news programmes to the soup manufacturer and to Hillary Clinton . “With the exception of the soap manufacturer, they all pledged support – and within a few months, the commercial was changed to, ‘People all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’.” Meghan has also been described as a royal not afraid to embrace full-on feminism. The Duchess has spoken of how itaposs important for men aposto understand they can be feminists as wellapos and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is. She is also a passionate charity campaigner and been a United Nations Women’s Advocate. Sheaposs made numerous trips to poverty-stricken countries to offer her support. Self-made Meghanaposs big break came when she landed the role of Rachel Zane on the popular legal drama, Suits. Before that, Meghan had a stint as a case holder in the game show Deal or No Deal, as well as several small film roles, including in Get Him to the Greek, and Horrible Bosses. She also had guest spots in television shows such as CSI: NY, Without a Trace, and The War at Home. Meghan played a nurse in daytime soap opera, General Hospital too. Walked down the aisle on her own Traditionally, the bride’s father gives his daughter away to her husband-to-be as they walk down the aisle. However, Meghanaposs father Thomas was forced to miss the lavish nuptials at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle as he needed heart surgery. Prince Charles did, however, walk Meghan halfway down the aisle. “The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way,” Kensington Palace’s statement read. Didnapost have maid of honour Conventionally brides always have a maid of honour. Kate chose sister Pippa as hers and Princess Eugenie chose her sister Beatrice. However, weeks before Meghan and Harry were due to get married, Kensington Palace announced Meghan would not be having a maid of honour - or any adult bridesmaids. A Palace spokesman said she simply couldnapost decide which of her friends to pick adding: She has a very close knit group of friends and did not want to choose one over the other. Snapped signing autographs Technically, members of the Royal Family are not allowed to sign autographs, with the exception being guestbooks. They have to politely declineasked by fans. The long-standing rule has been in place for all royals because of the risk of the signature being forged.  Meghanaposs father-in-law, Prince Charles, is said to turn down such requests with the response: Sorry, they donapost allow me to do that. But it didnapost stop Meghan kindly giving one -year-old fan her autograph during a trip to Cardf in Wales with Harry in January . However the former actress is no doubt used to the request and probably signed hundreds of autographs in the past.    Christmas with the Queen Meghan became the first royal fiancée to spend the Christmas holidays with the Queen at Sandringham. It is understood Harry asked his grandmother to make an exception for Meghan to attend in , despite her not being an official member of the family. Kate was not invited to spend Christmas at the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk, East Anglia, after her engagement to Prince William in November . She instead joined her parents at their home in Berkshire. Closed her own car door On her first solo engagement as the Duchess of Sussex at London’s Royal Academy, Meghan closed her own door after getting out of the car. Few royals have ever done this before. People on social media obsessed with the fact that Meghan did something so aposnormalapos and many praised her for being so down to earth.    One person said: A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! Another commented: First time Iaposve seen an on-duty princess shut her own car door... A third wrote: I had to smile - Meghan is closing the door of that car herself - you know sheaposs still used to doing that... Baby Archie Meghan and Harry were determined to dance to their own tune regarding how they handled the announcements surrounding the birth of their first child. Weeks before her due date, it was announced the pair would not be holding a huge photocall on the steps outside the hospital after the baby had been born. Meghan reportedly believed it was archaic. However, it is something Kate and Prince William had done with all three of their children, and Princess Diana and Prince Charles before them. Harry and Meghan had also previously refused to reveal where the Duchess would give birth, sparking speculation she had opted to have a homebirth. It was later revealed that son Archie was born at The Portland Hospital in London. Instagram In a royal first - Harry and Meghan used their Instagram account to break the news they had welcomed a son. The image featured the white intertwining H and M logo, bearing the words aposItaposs a BOY!apos. While underneath it said: aposTheir ROYAL HIGHNESSES the DUKE and DUCHESS of SUSSEX are OVERJOYED to announce the BIRTH of their CHILDapos. Meghan was very social media savvy before she became engaged to Harry and had to delete her accounts. She is also said to use it to post comments on other accounts, including the Kensington Palace one to wish Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis happy birthday. Not shy about gushing over Harry In October , Meghan gave a tell-all interview with Vanity Fair. She revealed some details of her relationship with her then-boyfriend, Harry. She gushed: Weaposre two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news. She added that le as she knew it didnapost change much by entering into the royal relationship, nor did her personality. According to royal historian Carolyn Harris, itaposs surprising that a potential member of the royal family would speak so honestly of their relationship. Carolyn said: In the past, when royal girlfriends did speak to the press, generally that didnapost bode well for the relationship.

Kirsty Adjei-Mensah’s le was changed for ever after a get-together for drinks in her mate Susan Robson’s garden. She was being walked home by Robson’s husband when her friend became suspicious. Robson, , followed them into a nearby lane and believed they had been or were about to kiss.    Kirsty insists she was mistaken, saying he had only given her a “peck on the cheek”. But Robson launched such a ferocious flurry of punches and kicks that Kirsty heard her neck break. She thought she was about to die. Even today,  months after the sickening assault, Kirsty, , is haunted by flashbacks, has post-traumatic stress and is suicidal. She struggles to make new friends and has only  per cent movement in her neck. And she can no longer work in her former role as a customer services adviser.    Robson admitted GBH with intent and was sentenced last month to four years. In an exclusive interview with the Sunday People, Kirsty said: “I remember the sound of my neck snapping when she kicked me in the face. I thought I was going to die.” Now she has four scars, at the front and back of her head, where a halo brace to ­support her neck and spine was screwed in. Kirsty said: “The flashbacks kept me awake at night. That was the worst. I couldn’t see a way out of the pain and I wanted it all to end. “The only thing that stopped me was my daughter. I have terrible anxiety and PTSD. I find it hard to leave the house.” Her injuries mean she cannot stand or sit for too long.    But instead of people ­sympathising with her, she has became a target of hate since Robson was sentenced. She said: “People called me up and ­terrorised me after Susan was jailed. I’ve had eggs thrown at my windows. “People have called me up to say terrible things because they must think I did something with her husband. I don’t deserve any of it. “What happened with Susan has left me unable to trust anyone. I can’t maintain a friendship now. I don’t go out, I hate ­having to meet new people.” Kirsty and Robson had ­immediately hit it off after meeting through a friend in common four years ago. Kirsty said: “Susan seemed really fun. We used to have a laugh. We liked shopping ­together. We went to the Christmas market in Newcastle one year and had a lovely time.    “She had a car and would give me a lt to places. We confided in each other, trusted each other and had a good friendship. I feel betrayed. She has ­completely changed my le. I’m ­suffering the worst pain imaginable. She can rot in jail for what she has done. She needs to learn a ­lesson, no matter how long that takes. I want her to stay in there forever. “She has never tried to apologise or reach out. All she did was try to get the charges against her reduced.” Kirsty’s ordeal began after she was invited to Robson’s house in Kenton, Newcastle, along with some close friends. They all sat in the garden drinking. When Kirsty said she was leaving, Robson’s husband offered to walk her home. Kirsty claims: “Susan was fine with it. Her husband told her and she didn’t bat an eye.” But she later became suspicious and started looking for them. Newcastle crown court heard how she found them in a lane near her home.    Kirsty said: “She shouted to both of us, ‘So that’s where you both are.’ “I remember thinking it was strange because it was such a charged reaction. “She completely got the wrong end of the stick, then she went for me. “I remember her kicking me over and over in my stomach and winding me. When I thought she stopped she dragged me into a nearby alley by my hair. “I couldn’t see her husband anywhere, and wonderedhe had gone to get help. “She started kicking me again and somehow I managed to get on all fours. I held a hand out to get her to stop, while I caught my breath. “When I lted my head to look her in the eye, the last thing I saw was her foot swinging towards my head at full force. I actually heard my neck crack before I passed out.” Kirsty was rushed to hospital. A year on, Kirsty still receives intense physio. She said: “The­ ­attack robbed me of my independence which I’m only just starting to get back now.    I couldn’t do anything for myself and had to rely on carers to help me wash and use the bathroom. It’s ­humiliating and degrading.” After nine days in hospital, Kirsty had to wear a big, heavy head brace for three months. She said: “The doctors said I had to stay awake to have the brace fitted in case something went wrong with them drilling into my skull. “That was almost as bad at the attack itself. I threw up all over my head and neck and I passed out several times.” Robson was also given a five-year order preventing her from contacting Kirsty. The jury heard Robson had eight ­previous convictions, including GBH for attacking a woman she accused of jumping a taxi queue in . Prosecutor Emma Dowling said: “The ­defendant’s husband offered to walk her part of the way home, saying he wanted to visit his ­mother on the way back, which he did. “The defendant formed the view the ­defendant’s husband was about to kiss her. What is clear from CCTV is she was repeatedly assaulted by the defendant in two separate incidents five minutes apart in the same location.” Kirsty said: “She’s a ­dangerous woman and I never want to see her again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons ex best friend","story":"NewsKate Middletons rural rival spotted without wedding ring at state banquetRose Hanbury, , has been married to David Rocksavage - the th Marquess of Cholmondeley and Lord Great Chamberlain - for ten yearsShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-Dickerson:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsKate and Rose were spotted hanging out on multiple occasions Shutterstock.

Their kids - Alexander, Earl of Rocksavage and Oliver, Lord Cholmondeley, and daughter Lady Iris - are also known to have a special bond with Prince George, with whom they often play. But the reported argument with Rose has been so big it reportedly brought the Duchess to order Prince William to phase her out from their social circle in Norfolk.  The Duke of Cambridge tried to broker peace between the two besties but to no avail.A royal insider told The Sun: It is well known that Kate and Rose have had a terrible falling out. They used to be close but that is not the case anymore.”    Kate and Rose were sat metres away from each other at the banquet last week in what seems to be yet another suggestion of the two being at loggerheads. But according to the Mail Online, both parties have denied any reports of a feud and even contemplated suing those speculating about it. But because all reports failed to have give a reason for the supposed rt, the couples have chosen to ignore it.

The end of terrace house, with traditional stone front, is up for sale in the pretty Welsh village of Treherbert in the Rhondda. But any potential buyer may be a little surprised to find out what lies behind the front door.Once inside, youaposre hit by a floor to ceiling Venetian inspired interiors  lavish and grandiose decor, that wouldnapost look out of place inside a stately home, reports Wales Online .The house is owned by Denise and Michael Protheroe, whoaposve spent the last decade gradually transforming it into their dream home - which they now share with their three Shitzus, Coco, Sparkle and Gucci, and their bird Twinkle.  Michael admits he now feels telling his we she could do she wanted with the house was a big mistake. Denise - whoaposs originally from Liverpool, met Michael, from Rhondda, while on holiday in Corfu around  years ago. When I first came up here, everyone thought I was nuts, -year-old Denise laughed. There was this one time, when a delivery man came to drop something off... Next minute, he comes running in with his camera and starts taking pictures. He saw the photo frame around my TV and said aposIaposve never seen anything like this beforeapos.  But, as long as youaposre happy. Itaposs your own house, and youaposve just got to do what you want with it - itaposs not everybodyaposs taste. And the couple couldnapost be happier. They make the perfect team - with Denise coming up with quirky and unique designs, and Michael - a former award-winning painter and decorator - making her visions become a reality. When I first met her and I asked her to move down - I told her you can do what you like to the house. That was a big mistake, Michael joked. I eat my words now. I never knew what I was coming home from work to. Denise - who says sheaposs always had an interest in fashion and interior design - says the interior of her house matches her outgoing, bubbly and colourful personality.    The theme is all glitz and glamour, with the chandeliers and diamantes, she said. I love glamour and sparkle - like Hollywood style mansions. All the little pieces Iaposve collected - they all mean a lot to me and they make me feel special. I used to go to a lot of manor houses, so thataposs what my intentions were with this house - to make it feel as posh as I could. I canapost afford a big manor house or a stately home or anything like that - so, this is my own little stately home. As you walk into Denise and Michaelaposs home, the entrance hallway is dripping with glass, crystals and diamonds.  The walls, mirrored cabinets and ceilings are packed with sparkling ornaments, fancy candle stands and ornate silver frames - all placed below a hanging crystal chandelier. The glamour continues in the dining room, and the open-plan space is packed with royal blue and silver crushed velvet furniture, ornaments, decorative bird cages, grandfather clocks and glass cabinets. The room revolves around a deluxe white dining table, and also includes a diamond-encrusted chaise lounge, th century settee, throne-like chairs, mirrors, vases and another crystal chandelier. The space under the stairs is also home to a huge doll-house - which Denise spent years designing, painting and decorating - even going as far as adorning the bathroom with porcelain fittings and asking her local funeral home to make a doll-sized gravestone for the church cemetary.  I just love using my imagination, Denise says. As you head further into the house, an intricate archway guards the entrance to the living room, which in-keeping with the opulent and regal theme is dressed with silver, glass and diamond fittings and framed by thick, heavy blue crushed velvet curtains which Denise made herself. Denise has designed almost every feature in the house - from the banisters to the mirrored staircase and sheaposs even made all of her own curtains and upholstered the furniture. Sheaposs up-cycled and painted almost everything - from the walls, to the fireplaces, lampshades, ling and even the white photo frame that hangs around the TV. Stand still long enough and Iaposll paint you, laughed Denise. From the diamonds around the fire place to the jewelled white throne that sits in the corner of the living room, painted Venetian sculptures, fairy-lights, mirrors and crushed velvet French-style furniture - Denise has meticulously planned, designed and created everything.  Even down to the sparkling glitter paint which covers the walls - created by buying big bags of glitter from BQ and mixing it with paint. And she gets her inspiration from property, DIY and antique television programmes, as well as the internet. I like old furniture, and I love visiting mansions and manor houses. So,when Iaposm there and I see a piece of furniture, I can visualise in my head where I want to put it in my house. And thataposs what Iaposve done. Towards the rear of the property is the kitchen, which unlike the grey and blue theme of the other rooms, is completely red. It has red chandeliers, utensils, flowers, chairs, units, crockery, towels, candles - and even a red ornament of the animated cartoon character Betty Boop.  Access to the first floor is gained via a striking feature staircase. The master bedroom then comes complete with a gold, regal-style canopy above the bed which was designed and created by Denise and Michael from pieces of plywood. Finished off with some gold curtains and hanging diamonds, it frames the white, vintage-style bed which is completely covered in cushions and decorative items. But, perhaps the most unique feature of the entire property is the Da Vinci-style mural which has been painted onto the ceiling of the master bedroom. Iaposve always loved murals on ceilings - like the ones in churches, cathedrals and mansions, Denise said. I thought one of these days Iaposm going to do something like that. Iaposm going to do that in my bedroom and, I did! Denise commissioned a local painter to do the mural who completed it in under two days. The bathroom also doesnapost disappoint when it comes to grandiose features. The stand-alone bathtub is raised on a specially built plinth, and the hand basin is built into an impressive base of storage cupboards - which Michael fitted himself.  Itaposs finished off with fairy-lights, crystal chandeliers and candle-stick holders, vintage ornaments, a knight in shining armour and even a crown above the toilet seat. If that wasnapost enough, the property also features a fully-renovated and insulated summer house which, following a tropical theme, is filled with pink and green curtains, flamingo decorations, plants and lights. It also comes with a hot pink, jewelled fireplace, a blue shaggy rug, crushed velvet chairs and even has electricity with a kettle to make tea and coffee and a television to watch DVDs. The summer house is just like another room - itaposs a nice place to just go for a cup of tea and a chat, Denise said. Unfortunately, Denise and Michael are now selling their beloved home as the couple plan to move to Liverpool to spend time with Deniseaposs family and elderly mother. My dad was ill with dementia and he died in January, Denise said. Living down here, I missed out on a lot of his le and being there with him. And now, my mum isnapost well. Iaposve also got two grandchildren up in Liverpool, so we want to go and spend time with them.  Michael added: When Denise moved down here, I told her that weaposd move back to Liverpool when I retired and when the time was right. And Iaposm not getting any younger! But, Denise says sheaposs already got hundreds of ideas for the designs of their new house in Liverpool. I go to bed and my mind goes a hundred miles an hour - I just canapost stop it, she laughed. The property is on the market for £, with South Wales Property Investors and Lettings. Estate agent Miranda Pugh said: We love having properties with the wow factor on our books and this property definitely has that. Not all buyers want your average style properties and some clients are unique and want something dferent. Some agents would be put off by this property, but not us. We love the wow factor and I can guarantee we will sell this house and help find these beautul sellers their next dream home.

David, who previously beat prostate cancer, has also dressed some of the world’s most famous women including Dame Shirley Bassey, Joan Collins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor. Yet surprisingly fashion was not the only love of this working-class Welsh boy who grew up with nine brothers and one sister. He sang with the Glamorgan Youth Choir at eisteddfods and also proved to be a gted pianist and violinist. He previously said that it was only fate that chose fashion as his future. “There were two things I cared about at school – music and art. I applied to both music school and art college and the envelope for art college came through first,” he told thein November .  It was at the Harrow School of Art where he met Elizabeth Weiner, the American designer who became his we in  and with whom he went on to study at the Royal College of Art – the only husband and we team ever to be accepted. It was soon after college that Lady Diana Spencer, as she then was, commissioned the relatively unknown Emanuel team to make That Dress. “Elizabeth’s father, supermarket tycoon Buddy Weiner, had faith in his daughter and so while other art graduates struggled she and her husband were given a Mayfair salon,” author Compton Miller, who wrote Who’s Really Who, previously said. “Bianca Jagger became their first celebrity client and some would say success came too quickly for this twinkly little couple who always insisted that they would have become famous even without Diana.”  There was no chance to test the truth of this because after the royal wedding David’s career soared. He and Elizabeth became household names and were accorded the privilege of having their portrait hung in the National Portrait Gallery. However the pressures of working together around the clock in such a creative and competitive industry overwhelmed them. They separated in  despite attempting to remain together for the sake of their children.

Followers of treble winners Manchester City will stump up the huge sum for their special edition shirt – while Cha fans will pay £. for a top to mark their victory in Europe. But the Nike shirts cost just an estimated £ to produce. And Thai workers making them are claimed to be earning a pitul £. for a -hour day. For their £., Cha and City fans get a shirt with their favourite player’s name, number and markings commemorating their club’s success. City’s top-priced shirt hits £. because it includes a shoulder badge. Sales come as Cha won the Europa League and City the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup.    Arsenal hoped to cash in too with a similar top at £ but reduced it to £. after they failed to win a trophy or qualy for the Champions League. Unlike normal replicas, the shirts are made from easy breathe fabric and are identical to those worn by players. But even Cha Supporters Trust said paying £. was “particularly unfair as many supporters are already struggling with the financial commitment of buying season tickets”. Liverpool, meanwhile, are marking their European Cup win with a Champions of Europe shirt at £. – and £. for juniors. Back in Thailand, cam-paigners say Nike workers doing  hours a week receive £. a day. The living wage of £. a day is deemed sufficient to support an adult and two children. The figures come from the fashion poverty charity Clean Clothes Campaign. It claims kit makers have failed to improve le for workers, insisting: “Poverty in the industry isn’t improving, it’s getting worse.” Nike, Puma, Adidas and Under Armour have all been accused of failing to pay the living wage to a single worker anywhere in the world. Nike make kits for Cha, Brighton, Watford and Tottenham. Adidas are the brand behind Manchester United, Arsenal and Leicester City’s kits. Puma will make Man City’s new kit, as well as Crystal Palace and Newcastle United’s. A Clean Clothes Campaign report said dire conditions facing garment workers needed urgent improvement. Author Anna Bryher said: “Our message to the brands is that human rights can’t wait and workers making the clothes sold in our shops must be paid enough to live with dignity.”    Campaigner Neva Nahtigal added: “Workers who make almost all the clothes we buy live in poverty, whilst huge brands get rich from their labour. “It is time for brands to be held accountable for the system of exploitation they created and profit from.” The prices for replica shirts rocket once the tops leave the factories. Nike pays Cha £million a season for the licence to produce its replica kits. City’s agreement with Nike ends next month and a new deal has been signed with Puma worth a reported £million a year. Man United collect £million a year from Adidas and sell about .million kits annually. They are made in Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh. United charged £ for a short-sleeve “elite” top last season – made by workers paid just p per hour. Women working in the factory have previously told how they were ordered to make up to  shirts an hour. New Balance make Liverpool’s kit in The Philippines, where the minimum wage is £ a day and conditions have been criticised.  Umbro, who make Bournemouth, Burnley and West Ham’s   kits, also manufacture in Bangladesh, scene of the  tragedy in which , textile workers died in the Rana Plaza collapse. Unions branded it “mass industrial homicide” after the badly-maintained building collapsed. Brands have since promised to pay living wages and clean up their act. But the Clean Clothes Campaign claim the pledges are ignored by third-party suppliers who set pay rates. Anna Bryher said: “Global brands and retailers have known for years the wages are not enough to live on, yet they continue to make empty promises while raking in massive profits.” Kit makers defended themselves last night. Nike said: “Everyone in Nike’s supply chain has the right to compensation sufficient to meet basic needs and provide some discretionary income. Nike’s Code of Conduct requires suppliers to pay at least the local minimum wage, including premiums for overtime, benefits and compliance with social insurance regulations.”  Puma said its kits were made in China and Vietnam, adding: “We monitor our suppliers and our compliance program has been accredited by the Fair Labor Association since . Our suppliers pay  per cent above minimum wages and  per cent above minimum wage when including overtime and bonuses.” Adidas said its workers were among the “highest paid in the industry”. A spokesperson added: “We have strict procedures to ensure iniduals are paid and treated fairly. All apparel suppliers in Cambodia are subject to audits. “We are also one of the very few companies in the industry that has fully disclosed its global supplier list.” A Cha spokesman said: “A number of supporters wish to celebrate our Europa League victory by purchasing a commemorative shirt and we are happy to cater for that market. But Cha FC sell the main replica shirt for £. for adults and from £. for children, in line with other leading European clubs.” Man City were approached for comment but had not responded last night. Prices are a kit in teeth say parents By Stephen Hayward  Alex Miller Parents last night accused brands of ripping supporters off over kit prices. They reacted as five Premier League sides revealed price rises for their standard tops for next season – with some clubs tipped to follow suit. Liverpool’s short sleeved junior shirt has shot up from £. to £. while Bournemouth’s new top has risen from £ to £. Southampton and Brighton have increased their replica short sleeved shirts for kids from £ to £. And Crystal Palace’s has gone up by the same amount, from £ to £. Justine Roberts, founder of the Mumsnet website, said: “Each season they seem to get increasingly unaffordable. Eight out of  parents on Mumsnet believe football merchandise is ripping off families, with children’s shirts costing as much as £.. “Sadly, many families don’t have a footballer’s pay packet to cover the cost.” The Sunday Mirror checked kits at all  Premier League clubs. Of the nine short sleeved adult kits launched so far ahead of next season, five clubs have raised their prices while the other four have pegged them. A Liverpool replica adult shirt now costs £., up £ from last season. A source close to the club said Liverpool was working hard to keep its prices competitive. Southampton’s short-sleeved top has gone up from £ to £ while Bournemouth have increased theirs by £ to £. Brighton and Crystal Palace are both charging an extra £ – up to £ and £ respectively. Manchester United, Cha, West Ham and Leicester have pegged their prices, with adult sizes ranging from £ to £. The replica kit market is worth £million a year. But club representatives have defended the rising cost to fans. Bosses insist the new prices are in line with other top sides across Europe and that they reflect the investments made in design, innovation, development and manufacturing.

The hospital told her to come in but she said she was quite relaxed. “I remember the midwe said: ‘Everything is normal, but you’re dilating.’ That was the beginning of hell, she said.Doctors tried to get Edie over the  week mark — deemed the minimum for le - but Nicola had to be rushed into a delivery suite and gave birth soon after.  Baby Edie was born at .am weighing  gramsjust  weeks and four days into Nicola’s pregnancy. Nicola added: “We only got to see Edie for a few seconds before she was taken away. “We were terried to look but we couldn’t not. She was tiny, her eyes were still fused shut, her skin was translucent, and she was terribly bruised from the delivery. “They told us that she was extremely weak and that her odds weren’t good. “But just as she went her leg moved. Among all the shock of the last few days, the horror of the delivery, and then the tragedy that we were now expecting to unfold that gave me the tiniest bit of hope.” Medics had few guidelines to follow due to the extreme and rare nature of Edieaposs case.    She was but placed Edie in an incubator and a protective plastic bag.

Ferentz, author of aposFinding Your Ruby Slippers: Transformative Le Lessons from the Therapistaposs Couchapos, said she uses the technique in order to help patients build a positive perception of themselves. There’s nothing more important than the way we talk to ourselves because that inner monologue informs in subtle and not-so-subtle ways all our subsequent thoughts, emotional states, and behavioral choices,” Ferentz said, according to Readeraposs Digest.  She said the way to have a better and healthier outlook on le is by writing down all your thankful for, as well as your strengths and achievements. You should then stand in front of the mirror and start repeating them to yourself out loud.  “Like anything , once you practice and approach it from a positive place, you discover it’s quite easy to do. It guides our le whether we’re conscious of it or not,” Ferentz said. Her theory has been backed by an academic study at the University of Lethbridge, which found that students who are taught how to engage in positive rather than negative self-talk are able to change their perspective on things. That in turn makes them go about their everyday lives with more confidence and positivity.  The author pushes her clients to give themselves a pep talk just ahead of challenging situations, just as athletes are often seen doing to auto-convince themselves of their capacity so it may give them the kick they need to perform, ortheyaposre lucky, outperform. Having said that, however, Ferentz said that voicing out frustations is also a constructive element towards getting to know oneaposs perturbations and whether itaposs worth dwelling on them or not. She said there is definitely a value to saying negative words out louds as they can be very validating. Her theory has also been backed by a previous study by Bangor University, which found that self-talk may actually be a sign of high intelligence. Dr Paloma Mari-Beffa, senior lecturer in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology, said: “Our results demonstrated that, evenwe talk to ourselves to gain control during challenging tasks, performance substantially improves when we do it out loud. “Talking out loud, when the mind is not wandering, could actually be a sign of high cognitive ing.

A clinic in Novosibirsk fitted the new bionic paws using sophisticated computer tomography and D modelling.    Vet Sergey Gorshkov boasted: “He is definitely the first cat in the world who experienced such surgeries. “The limbs have fully connected with the skin and bone. “The part of the limb that goes inside the body is spongy, the bone tissue grows inside it. He added: “We achieved a good result.  Ryzhik - meaning redhead or ginger in Russian - is not trying to remove the limbs, indicating he is content with his new mobility.

Puk Kireka, who has been in and out of jail for crimes relating to violence and extortion and been part of gangs, got the distinctive inking last year. The tattoo is the apospatchapos, or logo, of the Mongrel Mob gang in Napier, New Zealand. And the -year-old says he has struggled to get a job because of the huge inking. I know it will be hard to get a job with my tatts, the dad-of-three said. I will always be a mobster but it’s important to show we can have better lestyles. I want to bring some of the others on board this better lestyle.    Puk has been out of prison for five years now and believes rugby and a new attitude has helped transform his le. He started playing the sport last year but claims spectators have blasted the tattoo. One reportedly said: What’s that mobster doing on the field ... he’s giving our code a bad look.    Nevertheless, the man has lost kg since taking up rugby. Puk became a mobster in  when he was , which led to the two prison stints. He is still in touch with some of the gang members. A lot of them are still drinking and smoking. While they aren’t getting into much trouble they are still ruining their lives with their lestyle, Puk told Hawkeaposs Bay Today.  I’ve proved to be an inspiration for other mobsters throughout the country.Since they have read about my lestyle change on Facebook many have been in touch asking about my fitness programs so they can follow them. Basically I just wanted to get healthy ... look good and feel good.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions. Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day. Despite a number of the competitors making the most of the early finish and heading home, the final prize giving was one of the best attended in recent years.Clyde Cruising Club Commodore John Readman paid special thanks to the valued participants, sponsors, supporters, volunteers and locals, without whom there would be no event.Scottish Series Trophy and overall Series Winner: #Chimaera#Joe Deane Cup and Knox Anchor: Salamander XXIRosebowl: ChimaeraTunnocks# Cup: ReflectionCrinan Cup: Celtic SpiritCrawford McInnes Trophy : ReflectionLemarac Tankard: Celtic SpiritCauseway Cup: F#n GrAlfred Mylne Trophy: HeroClyde Bowl: Celtic SpiritValhalla of Ashton Salver volunteer Award: The Tech or Raynet TeamLa Rochelle Trophy: LyrebirdThe McIver Salver : F#n GrIRC: Forty LicksRC: ChimaeraIRC: HarmonyIRC: F#n GrCYCA: First by FarrCYCA: Salamander XXIICYCA: Celtic SpiritSigma  OOD: Leaky Roof Sonata OD: FiddlesticksHunter  OD: SeawordEtchells OD: HeroIRC: Something ElseCYCA: First EditionOne Design: Miss Moneypenny,  Class Association"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles defeat inveraray in camanachd cup","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsKyles Athletic are through to the quarter finals after beating Inveraray - at Kames Playing Fields.The opening goal came on  minutes following a scramble around the penalty spot.

Other esteemed visitors involved Mountbatten and Polish leader General Sikorski.Among the quarter of a million military personnel who passed through No  Combined Training Centre were famous names such as Sir Alec Guinness, James Robertson Justice, David Niven and James Doohan .As D-Day preparations were being finalised, plans were being made at Inveraray for of an invasion of Japan # before the sudden Japanese surrender following the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.After that, the No  Combined Training Centre was reduced to a care and maintenance basis."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-launches-free-online-access-to-students","story":"Accessto fact-based truth in society is a more pressing need than ever, Scotlandrsquos Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy has insisted.Kate Forbes MSPsaid that at a time when debate within society is becoming increasingly polarised, the ability to read reliable information would be vital.Her comments came as The Herald launched a new initiative to provide free access to heraldscotland across all colleges and universities in Scotland.It means any student or staff member who logs on to heraldscotland while connected to their campus wi can read its content free of charge.ldquoAccess to information, knowledge, fact and truth is more pressing than ever before, she said, ldquoand with The Heraldrsquos initiative they can provide that access to students and employees, which will hopefully set good habits for years to come.\"She added: ldquoThe Herald understands that easy access is critical.The new open access project issponsored by CGI, a technology consultancy group, and made possible by IT company JISC, who provide digital solutions for the UK education and research sector.The Herald has a long and strong relationship with Scotlandrsquos leading educational establishments.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche.

On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation.

As the holiday season begins, Writer at Large Neil Mackay, discovers how we can make tourism work better for all of Scotland.SUCCESS brings its own problems. Just ask Malcolm Roughead, the man who runs VisitScotland. Hersquos sold Scotland to the world and made the country outperform the rest of the UK, year after year, when it comes to attracting visitors from overseas. Apart from London, Edinburgh is the leading UK destination. Scotland regularly appears in lsquoTop Fiversquo lists internationally as a world class holiday spot.Itrsquos little wonder, really. Think of the nationrsquos landscape, history, shopping, sports, food and drink, and culture. Itrsquos a great all-round package for a traveller. Tourism is now the third most important pillar of the Scottish economy after financial services and energy. Therersquos , tourism businesses in the country employing , people, thatrsquos one in  jobs - making the sector worth pound. billion.But back to those problems. When tourism takes off in a country, itrsquos not long until folk living in the hot spots get a little peeved. That problem even has a name lsquoDoxeyrsquos Irritation Indexrsquo - a term academics use to explain the four stages towns and cities go through when tourists start to arrive. First therersquos euphoria - itrsquos great to be noticed after all then comes apathy - tourists get boring then irritation - why is my morning train filled with foreigners and finally, antagonism - I hate tourists.Streets get crowded, roads get jammed, properties get bought over for tourist lets skewing the housing market. Look at whatrsquos happening in Edinburgh and Skye right now - the two parts of the country really feeling the pressure of being beloved by tourists. This summer Skye will be teeming with visitors, roads will all but come to a standstill. Itrsquoll drive locals crazy. In Edinburgh, Airbnb is squeezing locals out of the property market - turning residential homes into tourists lets and jacking house prices and rents. No wonder some call it Unfairbnb. Airbnb has doubled in Edinburgh since , and therersquos now one Airbnb let in the city for every  residents - London has one for every  citizens. Only a few days ago, the head of the Fringe Shona McCarthy, warned of Edinburgh becoming lsquoseriously in danger of being anti-touristrsquo. Edinburgh and Skye may not be Barcelona where graffiti has been sprayed on walls telling tourists to go home, but therersquos a growing animosity to the way the success of being a great travel destination has affected the lives of ordinary people.As the summer holiday season starts to get underway, some of the nationrsquos leading industry experts have spoken of the need to remodel how we lsquodorsquo tourism in Scotland - in order to stop visitors antagonising locals. Tourism needs to be fair and to bring added value to the communities which feel disrupted. It looks like government will have to get involved - in an industry which traditionally has seen the state pretty hands-off. Money needs spent to offset the disruption tourism brings, and thatrsquos going to cause a headache in Holyrood. Therersquos other big ideas out there too when it comes to changing the face of Scottish tourism. lsquoWellnessrsquo - the whole mind, body, spirit trend - is the next big thing, along with lsquoGreen Tourismrsquo. What country is better placed to exploit those trends than Scotland, with towering mountains, beautul lochs and rugged coasts. But will even greater tourism success just bring more headaches as lsquoundiscoveredrsquo parts of the country begin to attract more visitors Here, we look at some of the big ideas being discussed to change the face of Scottish tourism for the better. SHARE THE LOVEThe trick that needs pulled off in Scottish tourism is dispersal. How do you get travellers out of places like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Skye and Inverness and into parts of the nation untouched by tourism  Dr Andrew Martin runs the Scottish Centre for Tourism, operating out of Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. He wants to see lsquotourism refresh the parts of Scotland other industries cannot reach - like Scotland beyond the Central Belt - which struggle as theyrsquore remote and donrsquot have other big industriesrsquo.Our rural communities often have a depopulation problem, and Martin says growing tourism will create jobs and see people staying rather than leaving. He also thinks the parts of Scotland which are tourist success stories need to lsquotake less people - but get them to spend more hellip bank where we are now and grow the spend per head which will take the pressure off the infrastructure and deliver greater economic benefit per touristrsquo. That means more high quality hotels in our hot spots, not cheap tourist traps.That could start pushing visitors out to other parts of the country where tourists travel less - like Martinrsquos own patch in Aberdeen and the north east. Tourism in Scotland is patchy, he says. KEEP THE LOCALS HAPPYGlenfinnan is currently experiencing the Harry Potter effect. Like many parts of Scotland, film and TV have drawn visitors to the Highland village. Outlander had a similar effect on places like Doune Castle. The Glenfinnan viaduct appears on screen as the Hogwarts Express chugs across it. Crowds are gathering to take pictures and soak up the scenery - but the village has only  residents and a very small carpark. Itrsquos getting a little unmanageable.The Scottish governmentrsquos relatively small Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund handed out poundm in its first round of grants to  projects across the country. Money was set aside for more parking at Glenfinnan. But really, thatrsquos just going to make tourists lives better - rather than the lives of locals. Dr Marjory Brewster, who lecturers in tourism at Queen Margaret University, says: lsquoThe infrastructure fund seems to focus on the tourists and it seems to overlook the communities and the impact that tourism might have on them.rsquoGovernment needs to help local communities lsquobenefit directly from tourismrsquo - one way of doing that, says Brewster, is to help small business set up. If people are making money and getting jobs from tourism, theyrsquore unlikely to see it as disruptive and negative. FLOG THE HIGHLAND GAMESBrewsterrsquos real field of expertise is Scotlandrsquos highland games. In fact, shersquos something of a world authority on this traditional part of our national culture. So, shersquos a little bemused why more isnrsquot made of the -plus highland games across the country when it comes to tourism.Authenticity is the buzz word in business these days - but nowhere is it more important than in tourism. Travellers want to feel asthey have experienced the real Scotland. lsquoHighland games are not promoted for tourists,rsquo Brewster says, lsquobut these are the kind of events that are traditional and have been there for hundreds of years. Itrsquos an honest authentic experience.rsquoAgain, pushing travellers out to rural communities where games go on, would see money cascade further afield and ease pressure on existing hot spots struggling to cope with visitor numbers. AVOID THE FATE OF SKYEAT the moment, Skye is a laboratory for tourism experts studying what happens when an area takes off internationally. Marina Martinolli set up the Skye Project - otherwise known as the Skye Tourism Economic Impact Study - from her base at Glasgow Caledonian University.Idyllic Instagram images going viral online, Outlander - the Skye Boat Song features as the seriesrsquo title music - as well as the opening of the Skye bridge to the mainland, and the removal of tolls, turbocharged tourism on the island. The economy has boomed, but infrastructure is creaking, particularly when it comes to roads and housing.In June , there were  Airbnb rentals on Skye, as of June last year there were . lsquoAirbnb has exploded and itrsquos a huge issue,rsquo she says. Therersquos been estimates that one in eight properties on Skye is an Airbnb.lsquoFor locals who want to buy properties, value has increased and they can no longer afford the same housing they used to,rsquo she says. Housing is also in short supply, and there are fewer properties to rent. Young people are leaving. Seasonal hospitality workers sometimes have to camp. lsquoTherersquos resentment in certain areas,rsquo says Martinolli.lsquoThe practical way to address it is to invest in the island, invest in the infrastructure so it can support the number of visitors coming to the island.rsquo Martinolli says the rural tourism infrastructure fund has projects on Skye for improved visitor parking at the Old Man of Storr and the Fairy Pools. Yet therersquos a homelessness problem on the island. lsquoThere are families waiting to be housed on Skye,rsquo says Martinolli, lsquoand thatrsquos a huge issue. Therersquos a lack of funding.rsquoTherersquos calls for a serious discussion about a tourism tax in the area, charging visitors to Skye, and the reintroduction of a levy on the bridge for non-residents - and that any such money should stay on the island. Current taxes raised on the island go to central government and so arenrsquot directly spent on Skyersquos needs when it comes to tourism.There is so much potential for Skye,rsquo Martinolli says. lsquoThe worry is that it just becomes a tourist attraction and nothing . We donrsquot want to go down that road. There are real people and communities and they have to be supported - they have to get benefits from tourism, not just the negative impact. If investment goes back into the island then itrsquos a win-win for everyone.rsquo At the moment, though, she says, the big winners lsquoare the Airbnbs of this worldrsquo. Success needs to tickle down. MARKETING UNDISCOVERED SCOTLANDlsquoWhy do we continue to market Edinburgh rsquo asks Professor John Lennon, founder of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University. Lennon is seen as Scotlandrsquos number one authority on tourism. He was instrumental in the creation of the North Coast  - known as Scotlandrsquos Route .People will come to Edinburgh no matter what - itrsquos like London, New York or Paris. lsquoWhy donrsquot we move that marketing budget, that development budget, out to other parts of Scotland where tourism could have a real impact,rsquo Lennon says.lsquoWe really need to rebalance the impacts of tourism, and where we get over-demand and all the impact that goes with that, like litter and traffic. Think about what imaginative marketing could do with undiscovered Scotland,rsquo he says.Lennon points to Italian tourism - where visitors can enjoy the hustle and bustle of big cities like Rome, or wile away the days in sleepy villages enjoying local food and wine. Thatrsquos a model Scotland could follow.Lennon does though caution against lsquothe Scottish disease of bashing successrsquo. His North Coast  project - which has dispersed tourists to parts of Scotland rarely visited - has come in for criticism over busier roads. lsquoIrsquom scratching my head and wondering what I was supposed to achieve there by developing a route,rsquo he says. If the roads werenrsquot busier then the project would have been a failure, he says. Other countries, like Ireland he says, would lsquodance a jigrsquo over any tourist success story. WELLNESS TOURISMItrsquos everywhere these days. The lsquowellnessrsquo trend has taken over just about every aspect of le from work to play to food and travel. Dr Marjory Brewster says lsquotherersquos a wealth of opportunityrsquo for Scotland to exploit the new trend. lsquoSensory tourism, being outdoors, feeling the wind, smelling the sea - many of these trendy aspects of tourism are associated with the rural environment,rsquo she says.Wildle and a wild landscape are what wellness-tourists are seeking - Scotland with its scenery fits the bill perfectly. Again, this could all help spread tourism around the country rather than leaving it concentrated in a few hot spots and cities.Chris Greenwood, head of research with VisitScotland, says wellness lsquois the big growth area. Itrsquos indicative of the way society globally is going, people feel more stressedrsquo. Successful tourism follows the lestyles people aspire to. This wellness trend can also help with another problem when it comes to the balance of Scottish tourism - that wersquore not a lsquoyear roundrsquo destination as yet - wersquore still dependent on those vital summer months.Wellness could transform something like Scotlandrsquos Dark Skies tourism - which sees travellers star-gazing in places like Dumfries and Galloway - from a niche activity to an all year round staple of the industry. GREEN TOURISMlsquoVisitors want to enrich their lives and this is expressed through concerns about the environment,rsquo says Greenwood. lsquoThey want to be seen as travellers, not tourists - they want to meet local people and see the real country.rsquo Green tourism is yet another driver of widening tourist destinations across the country.Greenwoodrsquos boss, Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, says lsquosustainabilityrsquo is one of the big buzz words in tourism today. lsquoHow good would it bewe were the first country in the world to come out with an energy efficient way of getting round the North Coast  rsquo Roughead asks. lsquoOrwe could link up charging points and electric vehicles with rail travel rsquoThe idea of using green transport in Scotland as a way of lsquomitigating carbon emissions as a kind of paybackrsquo for visitors who have made longhaul flights to holiday in Scotland, would be attractive to consumers in our increasingly green world, says Roughead.Scotlandrsquos wild weather even adds to the appeal when it comes to green tourism. It feels rugged, it accentuates nature. lsquoOur location just adds to our attraction,rsquo says Greenwood. THE HAND OF THE STATEHigh VAT and the cost of non-domestic rates are hurting tourist businesses, says Dr Andrew Martin of the Scottish Centre for Tourism. lsquoTherersquos good money to be made in the industry, however currently the winners are the government and the country as we are delivering jobs and money into the economy, but the operators could do with help,rsquo he says.Martin feels lsquoanti-businessrsquo policies need addressed. Some tourist companies need relief to stay in business, he says. Dr Majory Brewster says: lsquoMost of the businesses involved in tourism are micro and small organisations, but they bring in substantial amounts of money for the country.rsquo They need support, she says. lsquoThings can be quite challenging. Therersquos a high percentage which donrsquot last more than two years.rsquo BREXITEveryone in Scottish tourism fears Brexit. The industry depends on foreign workers. lsquoBrexit creates a shadow,rsquo says Professor John Lennon. Both tourists and foreign workers worry lsquowill I get inrsquo, he says. lsquoTourism is quite fragile,rsquo Lennon adds. lsquoIf people think there is any uncertainty about visiting a destination they will chose not to go. Itrsquos an emotional industry, it is not based on logic.rsquoBrexit is affecting investment. If the pound tanks foreign workers wonrsquot just leave because of the unwelcome atmosphere in the UK, theyrsquoll leave because they can earn more money in another country. Food prices could rocket in the event of Brexit as well. Costs will be passed on to consumers like tourists.lsquoWe need to make very clear to the international market that at least Scotland,not the UK, is open for business,rsquo says Prof Lennon. lsquoLetrsquos stand above this narrow-minded parochial nonsense that is Brexit.rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"funding-boost-for-childrens-social-media-advice-service","story":"The Scottish Youth Parliament and the Childrenrsquos Parliament are developing the national resource produced by and for children and young people.It is part of a package of measures to improve the mental health of young people, funded by the Scottish Government.Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said:ldquoSocial media does have the potential to be used in a hugely positive way, but we want to ensure young people are properly informed on how social media promotes unrealistic expectations.ldquoWe also want young people to know what the healthy use of social media s looks like.

The experiment left the writer feeling ldquonauseous, ldquoshaky and ldquogrim ndash and Dr David Katz, founding director of the Yale-Grfin Prevention Research Centre, condemned what he called ldquosilly and irresponsible reporting.The new caffeine study ndash by Queen Mary University of Londonndash had, after all, only claimed that drinking large quantities of coffee does not, as previously believed, put pressure on the heart by stfening the arteries. And as Katz pointed out, that doesnrsquot make it safe, with insomnia, high blood pressure and heart rate all possible effects of ldquoextreme coffee consumption.The British Heart Foundationndash which co-funded the QMUL research ndash also seemed annoyed by what it called ldquomisleading reports and released a statement pointing out its study had never suggested ldquounlimited coffee has no effect on cardiovascular health.Having read QMULrsquos initial press release, however, it doesnt come as a surprise that the reports were so dramatic, because it stated ldquodrinking coffee, including in people who drink up to  cups a day, is not associated with having stfer arteries. The explanation for this statistic, which came further down the release, was more nuanced.The ,-person study had been ided into three groups: ldquoThose who drink less than one cup a day, those who drink between one and three cups a day and those who drink more than three, explained the release. ldquoPeople who consumed more than  cups of coffee a day were excluded, but no increased stfening of arteries was associated with those who drank up to this high limit when compared with those who drank less than one cup a day. Even the higher-drinking group averaged only five cups a day.The aim of the research, BHF medical director Professor Metin Avkiran said later, was to better understand coffeersquos impact on the heart and circulatory system. ldquoThere are several conflicting studies, he added, ldquoand it can be dficult to filter what we should believe and what we shouldnrsquot.Hersquos right about that. The advice on caffeine is that around mgis a recommended safe level. Last weekrsquos dramatic headlines may have gladdened the hearts of the nationrsquos baristas, but they also provoked grumbles over yet another apparent reversal of received scientic wisdom.ldquoWersquove lsquobeanrsquo had! chortled the Daily Mail, above a column asking why, oh why, do the ldquohealth nannies get it so wrong  In previous eras, complained columnist Rose Price, butter and eggs have been subjected to ldquowitch-hunts by the ldquoheart health police only for advice to be ldquospectacularly overturned.She has a point. Dozens of foods, from eggs, butter and full-fat milk to wine, chocolate and turmeric, have been condemned, rehabilitated and damned again ndash sometimes repeatedly. Nor is Price alone in being irritated by all these apparent U-turns. Professor Michael Lean, chair of human nutrition at Glasgow University, describes yo-yoing food messages as ldquoa constant bugbear and ldquoa major obstacle to improving health.So why does it happen  Partly, he suggests, itrsquos because our ldquoobsession with health and diet means wersquore ever ready to blame ailments on our food ndash and while the boring truth is ldquotherersquos no drama attached to nutrition and the improvements that can be made are quite small, we are hungry for evidence that consuming more of one product or less of another will have radical effects.And there is no shortage of research scientists happy to oblige. ldquoThere are people in certain universities, especially in America, who crave publicity because thatrsquos how they get their research funds, says Lean, adding that the press is also ldquovery keen to amply anything that seems contentious.More humdrum research confirming what scientists already know is less likely to get reported. As a result, we only see reports that seem to conflict with what we were previously told.Caffeine seems particularly prone to this, partly, says Lean, because itrsquos ldquothe most valuable cash crop in America after oil ... And the minute you put something in about coffee, somebody will say the opposite.Studies that log eating habits against incidence of disease are notoriously unreliable, he says, quoting an old adage that ldquojust because % of people die within an hour of drinking a cup of tea doesnrsquot mean the tea has killed you.Likewise, people who drink more coffee may seem to suffer more from certain complaints. ldquoBut people who drink more coffee tend to smoke more ndash or at least, they did in the past. So thatrsquos a clear confounding factor. There are all sorts of reasons why survey data has to be interpreted with great caution.Even scientic journals arenrsquot always balanced ndash particularly on the emotive subject of sugar, says Lean. Research by his department showed a study linking sugar with disease is ldquomore likely to get publication in a good journal than one which shows therersquos no effect. ldquoTherersquos bias that runs right through the [scientic] journals, he adds.What, then, can a confused member of the public believe  Lean reminds us that official healthy eating guidelines have generally been produced by generations of scientists assessing ldquothe totality of research evidence.Dramatic studies suggesting shortbread will shorten your le or lettuce will let you live forever should be taken with a pinch of salt ndash a small one though, as scientists canrsquot agree over how much sodium is too much.Shaky groundsIn the s, coffee was blamed for causing sexual promiscuity but it was later hailed as a health food said to aid digestion, relieve coughs and prevent everything from gout to miscarriage. In , the Womenrsquos Petition Against Coffee claimed it caused impotence but by the s it was being promoted as a stimulant that helped people work longer. In subsequent centuries the drink was iously accused of causing blindness, stunting growth and hampering academic study.In the s, high coffee intakewas linked to heart attacks and high blood pressure but more recently itrsquos been claimed caffeine consumption can reduce the risk of everything from melanoma to Alzheimerrsquos disease. Last year, a review of scientic literature published in the British Medical Journal concluded that drinking three or four cups of black coffee a day provided health benefits but it also linked large quantities consumed during pregnancy to low birth-weight babies and stillbirths.The latest research, by QMUL, suggests coffee does not, as previously believed, put pressure on the heart by stfening the arteries. Butyou want to toast that news, dont do it with  espressos.Judged spreadsAlthough butter was long considered healthy, in the late th century concern about saturated fats impact on cholesterol levels led to a switch to margarines marketed as ldquohigh in polyunsaturates.Butter has since enjoyed a renaissance and as Glasgow Universityrsquos Michael Lean explains, the saturated fats in dairy produce dfer from those found in meats and donrsquot have the same effect on cholesterol. Healthy eating guidelines ldquoglossed over that distinction, and while Lean understands the need to simply complex nutritional physiology, he says scientists ldquogot it wrong basically by lumping all saturated fats together.Margarine itself fell from grace a few years ago over the potential harmful effects of trans-fatty acids and while commercial spreads have since been modied, sales have plummeted. Meanwhile, the butter vs margarine debate continues.Yolk and mirrorsDuring the s and s, The Egg Marketing Boardrsquos ldquogo to work on an egg slogan promoted this compact, natural foodstuff as a healthy breakfast for hard-working people.Eggs were later vilied for their supposedly high cholesterol content and people were advised to eat no more than two or three a week. Then in , junior health minister Edwina Currie said that ldquomost of the egg production in this country is affected with salmonella ndash and sales nose-ed. Consumer confidence has since been restored and the NHS website now says there is no recommended weekly consumption limit, describing eggs as good sources of protein, vitamins and minerals.The story of EDuring the late th century, health-conscious consumers were obsessed with ldquoE numbers, which referred to the classication of the  preservatives, flavour enhancers and other food additives approved for use in the EU. The system was meant to regulate additives and remove toxins from foods and many of the substances listed on products were harmless .Consumers were suspicious, however, and the flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate or MSGwas one of the biggest bogies, blamed for causing headaches, nausea and numbness: symptoms collectively dubbed ldquoChinese restaurant syndrome because the seasoning was commonly used in those establishments.Washington University researchers conducted experiments that produced stunted growth and sterility in mice and monkeys ndash but subsequent studies, including on humans, failed to repeat the results and today the Food and Drug Administration says the substance is ldquogenerally recognised as safe."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-leader-i-support-self-id-for-trans-people","story":"Leonard said he is broadly relaxed about the proposals for ldquoself-identication, which would scrap the requirement for iniduals to obtain a medical diagnosis from a doctor.However, his stance puts him at odds with some of his left-wing supporters, and his MSPs may get a free vote when it comes to Parliament.Under legislation from , a man or woman is required to obtain a Gender Recognition Certicate before making the change.A certicate can be granteda diagnosis of gender dysphoria has been provided, as well as evidence that a person has lived in their acquired gender for two years.Scottish Government plans would scrap the current system by allowing trans people to self-declare - otherwise known as \"self-id\" - as another gender.Critics of the status quo believe the present system is humiliating and Amnesty have stated: ldquoThe current process by which trans people have their gender legally recognised is dehumanising, long and costly.However, the proposals have angered critics who believe that the rights of women and girls are threatened by a system of self-id.They fear that women-only spaces, such as toilets, and single sex services could be used by men pretending to be trans women.Although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backs the changes, the SNP is deeply split on the issue.Leonard, whose party is also ided on trans rights, has now echoed the First Ministerrsquos support.On whether he supports the principle of self-identication for trans people, he told this newspaper: ldquoYes, I do.Asked about the concerns expressed by womenrsquos rights campaigners, he said: ldquoThe concern that I have had about the debate is that there has been an attempt to shut down the debate.

At present Irsquom not able to give my side of the story. I hope to be in a position to do so soon.She added: ldquoI am not and never have been a bully. Fraser Thompson is not a bully either. I believe these to be politically motivated smears.Senior party figures believe Cherry, a QC, wants to succeed Sturgeon as SNP leader.She has been tipped as a possible selection candidate for Edinburgh Central at a Holyrood level. Former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson is also believed to be in the running.At row escalated last month, Cherry ldquoliked a post on Twitter which contained a link to an article speculating on Sturgeonrsquos departure from office.The Herald on Sunday can reveal that Cherry emailed local SNP members on May th about a campaign session for the European Parliament elections.She wrote: ldquoI hope you will understand that I am unable to join you today. As you will be aware I have had a stressful time recently and the abuse and threats have take [sic] their toll.She continued: ldquoIrsquom afraid we are going through a very dficult time in our party whereby factions and infighting leads to attempts to smear those seen as as [sic] potential future leadership figures.ldquoI try to be strong but sometimes the lies are hard to bear so I need a little bit of down time with my family this weekend to lick my wounds.One party insider said the leadership claim was ldquodisrespectful to Sturgeon, who has not indicated that she wants to quit.Rumours circulated last month that Sturgeon was interested in a job at the United Nations, but she flatly denied the speculation when asked by the media.A senior Edinburgh SNP source said: ldquoItrsquos disappointing that Joanna spent so little time with activists on the key campaigning days before the European elections.She clearly preferred to spend her time on Twitter and in self-promotion as a lsquopotential future leadership figurersquo, to use her own words. I suppose we should be grateful she came out on polling day here in her constituency to have her picture taken for social media.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: \"Any claims of abuse and threats in the SNP need to be fully investigated. All parties have a duty of care for staff, MPs and MSPs. That aside, the fact Ms Cherry now sees herself as a future SNP leader shows how deep the fractures run in the party.\"The SNP did not provide a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"esther-mcvey-accuses-mps-trying-to-halt-brexit-of-tearing-up-400-years-of-history","story":"The former work and pensions secretary said it would not be her ldquopriority to suspend sittings in the House of Commons in the run-up to the October  deadline, but said she would be willing to ldquouse all the tools at our disposalshe won the race to replace Theresa May.Speaking to The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One, she also confirmed she had never taken Class A drugs after her rival in the Conservative contest Michael Gove admitted to using cocaine ldquoon several occasions at social events more than  years ago.Ms McVey said it should not be a bar to him becoming prime minister, saying she hopes ldquopeople will actually judge him on how good hersquos been as a politician.On Brexit, she was was asked about her previous comments that she would be willing to prorogue Parliament in order to stop MPs from blocking the UK from leaving in a no-deal scenario when the Article  period ends.\"I would use every tool at my disposal\"Conservative Party leadership contender Esther McVey discusses suspending Parliament to ensure a no-deal #Brexit#Marr https:t.co dqdDdqVF pic dLIReRfmdash BBC PoliticsJune , She said: ldquoThat wouldnrsquot be my priority, I wouldnrsquot be looking to do that, no, what Irsquove said is we would use all the tools at our disposal.ldquoWhat we have seen by MPs going against the democratic vote of the country, is they have torn up  years of history.ldquoTheyrsquove ripped up the rule book, so it seems somewhat wrong to me that people wanting to frustrate the vote can rip up the rule book, yet should I want to use any tools at my disposal I would be seen as incorrect when Irsquom helping ensure the democratic will of the people.ldquoCan you see a conflict of thought in that process Pressed on whether as PM she would go to the Queen and ask her to suspend Parliament, she simply said she would use ldquoevery tool at my disposal.She added: ldquoThe hypocrisy of people saying they would be ripping up the rule book and I would be using the laws.Askedshe would work with Nigel Farage given her views on Brexit are closely aligned with his, she rejected the idea, saying: ldquoWhat I would be doing is delivering Brexit so we donrsquot need a Brexit Party once wersquove delivered Brexit.And she defended her plans to have a Cabinet full of only Brexiteers, saying there is limited time until October  and she cannot have people who are not ldquocommitted to leaving on that date in her top team, eventhat means sacking numerous senior ministers.Ms McVey saidthey originally voted Remain, but now agree we should leave by October , then they would be allowed to stay, and once the UK exits the EU ldquoanybody can be in the Cabinet.Can every candidate ndash starting with @BorisJohnson ndash please now personally clary that they completely rule out poroguing parliament  Locking the door on parliament would be offensive, undemocratic and ultimately futile.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"insight glasgow s lap dancing clubs face stricter regulation","story":"Dani Garavelli asks some artistesthey feel exploited performing near-naked in bars # and learns of a sector in need of regulationThe voice on the loud-speaker is like a fairground barker’s. “Next on the stage” [dramatic pause] “Melinda.” Like most of the “girls” at the Diamond Dolls lap dancing club in Glasgow, Melinda is wearing a thong, suspenders and f***-me shoes with huge s at the front and stiletto heels that could kill a man.She walks the few steps to the small white  in the centre of the room and wraps herself round the pole. For several minutes she spins and twists, her long hair touching the floor as she tips upside down. Some of the men look on goggle-eyed, others barely glance in her direction. But Melinda’s performance is strangely self-contained detached from the attention or inattention of others .Tucked away in Mitchell Lane, Diamond Dolls announces itself brashly with a vertical neon sign in which the two “Os” are jewels. A doorman explains the rules to newbies: “£ entry. No touching the girls. No propositioning the girls.” Then he ushers us in.We climb a flight of stairs. On the wall are two framed T-shirts. One – with a picture of a penis – reads: “Another satisfied customer” the other bears the legend: “Diamond Dolls Showbar: Stag Party HQ.” The club itself is neither particularly glamorous nor particularly sleazy. The bar – which today is offering cheap beer at £. a bottle and shots for £. – is back-lit in neon pink while retro mirror balls cast flecks of light across the ceiling and walls.The clientele is mixed. A group of noisy young lads has commandeered one alcove the remainder is mainly small groups of three or four. One man, who appears to have wandered off the set of The Inbetweeners, has come alone. The girls are a mixed bunch too. I count  of them altogether. Most are Scottish and could be students, but there are also a couple of Eastern Europeans.When they are not dancing, the girls mingle. The men buy them drinks, chat, then slip into a side booth or behind a curtain for a private dance after which the girls move on. It’s a complicated mating ritual, with no hope of consummation. I find myself gazing at a woman’s splayed buttocks because – thanks to new legislation – “Lap Dancing: a source of empowerment or a form of oppression ” is once again a hot topic for debate. Diamond Dolls is just one of many lap dancing clubs in Scotland. Glasgow has three more: Forbidden, Platinum Lace and Seventh Heaven Edinburgh, of course, has the “Pubic Triangle” at the intersection between Bread Street and Lauriston Street, where Burke and Hare, Baby Dolls No  Showbar and the Western Bar all compete for business. Dundee has Private Eyes. At present, such clubs are largely unregulated. Because they require only alcohol licences, local authorities are unable to attach conditions to the lap dancing side of the businesses. This was tested after Glasgow City Council rejected a licence application from Spearmint Rhino – then running a venue on Drury Street – on the grounds that two of the women had removed their bikini bottoms and that there had been considerable contact with customers, both of which breached the licensing board’s code of conduct.But in  the Court of Session ruled the code of conduct had no statutory basis and that issues around the regulation of lap dancing had nothing to do with the sale of alcohol. In the wake of this, the Scottish Government re-examined existing legislation. It believes that – like prostitution, pornography and human trafficking – lap dancing is a form of violence against women. In , it introduced the Air Weapons and LicensingAct which allowscouncils to introduce Sexual Entertainment Venuelicences and to cap the number of licences allowed in their authority area. Putatively the cap could be set at zero. Cosla and several women’s groups support a ban, though any move to close existing premises would most likely be challenged through the courts. The Act came into force earlier this year, with guidance published on  April. Last week, Glasgow City Council became the first council to launch a public consultation into its lap dancing clubs. It is seeking views on whether to introduce SEVs and,so, what conditions should be attached. It also wants to know how many –any – lap dancing clubs should be allowed, and what issues should be taken into account in considering where they should be sited.The consultation is to last  weeks in the hopes of gathering as wide a range of views as possible. The council appears to be treading carefully because it knows the issue is likely to prove contentious. The Scottish Government is by no means alone in its view of lap dancing clubs as inherently exploitative. In , Iceland became the first country in the world to ban lap dancing and strip clubs for feminist rather than religious reasons. Under prime minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, it became illegal for any business to profit from the nudity of its employees. Such views are prevalent in Scotland too. When a lap dancing club called Sin was given the go-ahead to open in Kirkcaldy last year, former SNP councillor Marie Penman formed the group Women Together Fe to fight it.Penman believes lap dancing fosters the sexually-entitled attitudes of some men, including those who regularly cat-call her -year-old daughter.“I had strong opinions on this anyway, but then the local MSP [David Torrance] saidit brought jobs to the local area he thought it was a good thing,” she says. “It really riled me he thought being a lap dancer was a decent job with no contract, no fixed pay, no pension – it seemed outrageous.”Not everyone agrees, however. There are plenty of women, including lap dancers, who see it as a positive way to express their sexuality and earn a living they believe a ban would be an erosion of personal choice.Mandy Rose Jones first started lap dancing in Glasgow in , came away from it for six years, then went back for a year between  and . The first time round, she kept her job a secret, but, now the consultation is under way, she feels it is important to be forthright about her opposition to a ban.“I started because I was a student and wanted to earn a bit of extra money,” she says. “I found it a positive working environment, there’s a sisterhood among the girls, and I was working a lot less hours than my friends.“People seem to think it’s a massively misogynistic environment and that is not my experience.”She says a ban on lap dancing clubs would leave many of those who work there on the poverty line. “Those women could end up in precarious situations because they have lost their jobs,” she says.This is how most lap dancing clubs work: the women pay a nightly fee to work in the club then they dance round the pole for free to entice customers. They receive only the money spent on private dances: usually £ or £ a shot.Everyone agrees that on a good night, lap dancers can make good money. But on a very bad night they can go home with nothing. The evening I was in Diamond Dolls, there seemed too few customers for  girls. The club can’t lose. If it charges each dancer £ a nightthen it has guaranteed takings of £. All the risk is on the girls.As far as contact with the customers is concerned, the dancers I spoke to were adamant the rules are strictly enforced and that there was no cross-over from lap dancing to prostitution. There are cameras in every booth, they said, and in any case,the girls were willing to be escorts, then why would they bother with lap dancing But health workers I spoke to weren’t so sure. They said the cubicles for private dances were so small touching was almost inevitable and that they have encountered women who have worked as both lap dancers and escorts.Elizabeth Row, , is a student at the Glasgow School of Art creating work around cultural concepts of femininity and the male gaze but for around a decade, she worked in lap dancing bars in Edinburgh.“I came from a nice, middle-class background, so I suppose it was that element of being constrained in a traditional and conservative household,” she says. “We never talked about sexuality. I always knew my sexuality and my body wasn’t wrong because obviously it existed for me as a biological fact, but I didn’t like that it felt wrong so I was intrigued by the prospect of being in an environment that seemed to me quite liberating. An environment where I wouldn’t be judged and where I could earn the money I needed.”So did it prove as liberating as she’d hoped  Well yes. And No. “I consented to being objectied in the context of the lap dancing clubs – and I enjoyed it,” she says. “I think maybe the reason I enjoyed it is because there are so few examples of women being unashamed of their body, and confident in their sexuality, so it felt novel. When I am giving a guy a lap dance, it’s almost like he is just a prop for my self expression. I’m not necessarily aroused by the situation, but I enjoy being naked and the moving of my body to the music. And I suppose, as I dance, I am a prop for him too.”Yet the potential for female self-expression is undermined by the way the clubs are run and by culturally-embedded misogyny which shapes the way the women who work there are perceived.“In lap dancing clubs, you are technically self-employed, yet you are still treated like an employee,” Row says.“You can be fined for being late, forced to work extra shts, and they can suddenly change the amount they want to charge you because they feel like it’s been a profitable night – although it may not have been profitable for everyone.“It is easy for things like this to be brushed under the carpet because “who cares about the sluts ” and no one complains because we feel like it is just the way it goes.“The management will say: ‘You make so much money why would you care about having to pay a bit of extra now and again ’ but the issue is not how much money you are making but the fact you are being taken advantage of by a mainly male establishment which quite frankly wouldn’t have a businessit weren’t for you.”Row says, in her experience, the clubs are mostly safe. “There are bouncers whose job it is to look after you,” she says, “but it depends on which club you are in. Sometimes bouncers are quite attached to the club and,you are a dancer who is going to kick up too much fuss, you are less inclined to get the protection you need even though you are in the right. Ora customer is a big spender they might not be removed from the club eventhey have physically or verbally assaulted you, but again you can’t complain about it no-one cares.“Most of the time you are safe, though, because the other women will always have your back. A very deep bond develops between you, even though you might not be friends in other circumstances, because you all understand what it’s like to work in this industry.”Row – who went back into education at  – says deep-seated sexism leads men to see women who are strippers as “damaged” and outside social norms.“But the strip clubs are not the issue. If you try to shut them down all you are going to be doing is putting a plaster over bigger, more pressing issues. Men should not be horrible to women regardless of whether they are strippers or prostitutes they should not be horrible to women full stop. “We should be educating men, not taking away employment and employment opportunities for students and caregivers and women who refuse to work for minimum wage and who, quite frankly, just like having loads of money – and there is nothing wrong with that.”Row was dancing in the now-closed Sapphire Rooms in Edinburgh when photographer Jannica Honey was commissioned to take photographs of the girls who worked there back in . Honey, who is Swedish, spent four months getting to know them and taking pictures of them in the dressing room and while performing.“Whenever people talk about lap dancers, it’s either sad-assed stripper or empowered woman there’s never a middle ground,” she says. “You hear about students at college making shit-loads of money, but I think it is a bit of a myth. I do know someone who made enough to buy a flat in Edinburgh at an early age. But I also remember a woman who had paid to dance and she wasn’t getting any customers. So she got more and more frantic. Then the customers said: ‘Oh, she is desperate’ so they weren’t interested and at the end of the night she was out of pocket.“I’m Swedish. I don’t care about getting naked, but what kind of a job is it where you pay to go to work, you work all those late hours and you still could leave without making anything As for the prospect of cleaning the industry up, Honey is dubious. “One lap dancer said to me that men who go to strip clubs get turned on by the seediness of it, the secret shame-based element,” she says. “I think that’s important. It’s a liminal space where anything can unfold so it can’t just be a regular job. It’s just not within its nature. It’s not what people subconsciously want.”With so much heat in the lap dancing debate and, to be frank, no mounting public clamour for a crackdown, there is a palpable frustration over the Scottish Government’s decision to question its morality, while delegating all the tough judgments to the local authorities.It is the local authorities, not the Government, that will be caught in the cross-fire between those who see the sexual entertainment industry as legitimateand those who see it as an inherent wrong.It is the local authorities that will have to pick their way through the complexities of human sexuality and power dynamics and mull over the philosophical questions of choice, self-expression and exploitation. In the meantime, back at Diamond Dolls, Thursday night has tipped into Friday morning. The lad from The Inbetweeners is chatting intimately with one of the girls. Were it not for her outfit, they could easily be a couple. As they head off for a private dance, I make for the women’s toilets which are used as a changing room by the girls. Beside the basins lies a cluster of toiletries. Hairspray, mouthwash, a few toothbrushes in a tumbler: all quotidian reminders of the ordinary lives behind the vampy personas.By the time I , the private dance is over. The lad is back at the bar. His girl has vanished and he is, once again, drinking alone.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"2m fundraising bid to save world s last sea going paddle steamer in scotland","story":"A #make or break# # million campaign to save the world#s last sea-going paddle steamer will be launched this week after the Waverley was forced to cancel all its sailings this year.The ship’s boilers will have to be replaced after structural defects were found, in what will be the maritime equivalent of open-heart surgery.Would-be passengers will be asked to donate the price of a trip they would have taken had the vessel not missed a season for only the second time in her -year history.It is also only the second year there has been no paddle steamer on the Clyde since the Comet, Europe’s first passenger steamer, started operating in .The fundraiser, to be announced on Saturday, will be the biggest plea for popular support for Waverley, beloved by generations of Scots taking a trip “doon the watter”.Waverley Excursions, which operates the ship, said it was crucial the money was raised toit to service next summer.General manager Paul Semple said: “We have to get Waverley back next year, but it will be a signicant struggle. Waverley is only here because of the passengers who sail in her.“Most of our income to keep the ship running is funded from passengers and fares.“If everyone bought a ‘virtual ticket’, we would have the money needed. If we get the money, she willto sail. True preservation is Waverley doing what she was built to do.“She is a link back to the past. My gran spoke about the ship asthere was no other.”Offers of help have already come in, from crane firms to businesses in Dunoon, who benefit from daytrippers coming off the ship. This year’s sailings were cancelled last month after an unexpected amount of damage was found to the boilers, which were last replaced in  with an anticipated -year le span.Semple said: “We found structural defects to the boiler shell and furnace.“We made initial repairs but then realised the extent of the damage. If we had continued, we would have lost half the season, and even then, there was no guarantee we would have got many more years out of the boilers.”The work, which is expected to take around four months, will involve removing the funnels and slicing open a section of the deck to remove and replace the two boilers.Semple said: “It is the biggest single component that needs replacing. In ship’s terms, it’s like open-heart surgery.”The initial target is to raise enough for a deposit for the new boilers, which will take six months to order. It is hoped the refit can be completed by June next year.Semple said although some £, was spent on annual refits, “we don’t hold reserves for this sort of job”.Waverley has been a remarkable survivor, having been expected to become a static restaurant museum when she was “offered for preservation” in .That followed the state-run Scottish Transport Group, owner of newly formed operator Caledonian MacBrayne, deciding to reduce the number of Clyde steamers from two to one – the Queen Mary.Waverley was bought for £ by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society , which successfully ed her to service.She became the public’s favourite and outlasted the other vessel, which was decommissioned in  and is now being turned into a venue and education centre adjacent to Waverley’s base beside the Glasgow Science Centre at Pacic Quay. Waverley was built in Glasgow and entered service in  for the London and North Eastern Railway, which named its steamers after characters in Sir Walter Scott novels.In addition to summers on the Clyde, the vessel has toured the south coast and north west of England since  to boost income, with her last trip being on the Thames in October.PSPS vice-president Douglas McGowan, who played a central role in its acquisition of Waverley, said the ship had reached a critical point.He said: “We do not have much time to raise the money.

Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus.

He said it is a pleasure to be opening The Old Mill Bakery, adding they are happy to have opened the famous bakery again, under the new name, and with some new taste.They sell Leith’s wheaten bread, soda and potato breads, pancakes, scones, traybakes, sandwiches and sausage rolls. Worthy of mention is the Rosie Square - named after a former well known and loved Leith’s Bakery employee, Rosie Bryans.She was quite a character and was held in high esteem by the customers and staff alike.For the new bakery doughnuts are a speciality* The Old Mill Bakery Opening hours are -Monday to Friday, .am until .pm Saturday, .am until .pm.The Old Mill Bakery is located at  Mill Street, Ballymena.Why not give it a try!

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

But how exactly are the books balanced The game will allow users to decide whats worth forking out public money on and where to make cuts.William Crawley said: “I’ve been across Northern Ireland, in our hospitals and schools to hear about the impact that increasing demand is having on our public services. \"It’s clear we as a society have many decisions to make about the best way to spend our money but it’s far from straightforward – while we would all like more money to spend, there’s only a limited amount to go around.”Tara Mills said the documentary aims to dispel the myths about how much money is raised in Northern Ireland and how much comes from Westminster.“We bring together dferent groups of people to pretend to be Finance Minister for the day. It’s fascinating to see where they would like to see money spent – and who would lose out,\" she said.Spend It Like Stormont will air on BBC One Northern Ireland at pm on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle.

The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/resources/images/4656853.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

The Glasson cow calved in February and is currently giving  litres of milk per day at .% butterfat and .% protein..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog “She is a tremendously well-bred animal,” Simon Haffey confirmed.“Our plan is to take embryos from her later in the year.”There was a tremendous turnout of dairy stock, across the board, at this year’s Armagh Show. The same could also be said for the number of visitors coming through the gates of Gosford Forest park, the now traditional venue of the event. Frequent heavy showers failed to dampen the enthusiasm and enjoyment of everyone taking part in what has now become a blue-ribbon event in the Co Armagh calendar. Meanwhile, in the beef cattle rings, the Matchett family, from the Birches in north Co Armagh, were having an equally successful day. Their two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Niki won the Beef Inter Breed Championship. She beat off the stf opposition posed by the majestic Limousin bull, shown by the Crawford family from Co Fermanagh.Niki was bred by Co Roscommon breeder Ciaran O’Donnell.“She is confirmed in calf to Allenford Vagabond,” Gail Matchett explained.“He is quite an old bull now but is an extremely easy calving sire. We currently have six pedigree Charolais females in the herd. We plan to grow this number for the future.” This year’s Armagh Show was also marked by the confirmation from the PSNI that rural crime has reduced signicantly across Northern Ireland. Inspector Kieran Quinn, who is based in Armagh city, attended the event. He said: “Rural crime figures have fallen by % over the past number of years.Hastings leboat volunteers pay respects to French leboat crew after tragedy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This is a very encouraging figure and reflects the efforts farmers are taking to prevent crimes from taking place in the first place.”He added: “There are  PSNI officers operating in the Banbridge, Armagh, and Craigavon areas.

There is nothing sacred anymore and no certainties. The DUP which once adhered to a strict moral code seem to have compromised their principles. Yet people continue to vote for them. Is this a case of the blind leading the blind To be fair we don’t have much of a choice because there is no credible unionist opposition. The UUP is just a pale imitation of the DUP.They are each in tow to what is loosely called “The Peace Process.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog To add to the confusion the Protestant churches are equally committedtruth is isive it is watered down or it has to go.Someone once said that “morally and spiritually the country is on a downward spiral and evangelicals are clapping their hands”. They are not reading the signs of the times -they were they would be raising their hands in despair.The nationalist community has no reason to be smug. They continue to vote for parties that have long since abandoned any pretence of promoting Christian values. In doing this they are making an even greater contribution to Ireland’s moral decline.All the parties affirm their commitment to peace but the presentation is so insincere and so inept. It’s a peace built on crumbling foundations at the expense of truth: “Don’t Offend” is the new mantra.We all know this and yet we continue to buy into it. No-one in their right mind wants toto “the troubles,” butwe sacrice truth to the  gods of peace I find that even more frightening.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Glasson cow calved in February and is currently giving  litres of milk per day at .% butterfat and .% protein.“She is a tremendously well-bred animal,” Simon Haffey confirmed.“Our plan is to take embryos from her later in the year.”There was a tremendous turnout of dairy stock, across the board, at this year’s Armagh Show. The same could also be said for the number of visitors coming through the gates of Gosford Forest park, the now traditional venue of the event. Frequent heavy showers failed to dampen the enthusiasm and enjoyment of everyone taking part in what has now become a blue-ribbon event in the Co Armagh calendar. Meanwhile, in the beef cattle rings, the Matchett family, from the Birches in north Co Armagh, were having an equally successful day. Their two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Niki won the Beef Inter Breed Championship. She beat off the stf opposition posed by the majestic Limousin bull, shown by the Crawford family from Co Fermanagh.Niki was bred by Co Roscommon breeder Ciaran O’Donnell.“She is confirmed in calf to Allenford Vagabond,” Gail Matchett explained.“He is quite an old bull now but is an extremely easy calving sire. We currently have six pedigree Charolais females in the herd. We plan to grow this number for the future.” This year’s Armagh Show was also marked by the confirmation from the PSNI that rural crime has reduced signicantly across Northern Ireland. Inspector Kieran Quinn, who is based in Armagh city, attended the event. He said: “Rural crime figures have fallen by % over the past number of years.Police have a deflating experience Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“This is a very encouraging figure and reflects the efforts farmers are taking to prevent crimes from taking place in the first place.”He added: “There are  PSNI officers operating in the Banbridge, Armagh, and Craigavon areas. Our primary role is to advise farmers on how to prevent crime taking place in the first instance.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
