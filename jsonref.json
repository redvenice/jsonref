Industry analysts looking at five major supermarkets typically see around 2,700 increases in early January, but this year it is closer to 4,400.Across all food retailers, almost 10,000 products have shot up in price over the new year. Research by price tracking and retail analysts Assosia looking at a basket of common products found an average increase of 6 per cent in the past year.For someone spending £430 a month on groceries, around the UK average, that adds up to an extra £25 a month. Some of the increases on big-selling household name products are particularly startling.The survey picked up an 18 per cent hike on a tin of Heinz baked beans and 12 per cent on beef mince, frozen peas and Jordans cereals. The increase was 11 per cent on supermarket-brand chocolate digestive biscuits, 9 per cent on milk, 8 per cent on eggs and 7 per cent on wholemeal bread.The biggest hikes the survey found were 32 per cent on Stork baking spread and 22 per cent on Lurpak lighter blended butter and rapeseed."},{"url":null,"title":"Ferry boss predicts 20 mile motorway queues unless Covid checks lifted Easter","story":"Share this article Since Friday, fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s arriving in the UK no longer need to have taken a pre-departure lateral flow test.And if demand for travel eventually returns to pre-pandemic levels, the ferry boss has predicted there will be behavioural changes among holidaymakers.He said: \u0027I do think that maybe there will be a shift a little bit away from long haul back towards more local holidaying, and I guess that also underlying there\u0027s that element of sustainable travel, green travel.\u0027Mr Parker argued that travel by ferry is better for the environment than by plane and that the Dover-Calais route transports important food and medical supplies to the UK.He added: \u0027Those vessels are going backwards and forwards anyway, so if you are travelling as a passenger your footprint is offset by the fact you\u0027re using something which is happening anyway.\u0027DFDS recently invested in a fleet of electric trucks and aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050."},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon told provide light end tunnel Covid beleaguered Scots","story":"Share this article   Miss Sturgeon told the broadcaster: \u0027We are in a position where we all want to get to as much normality as possible.

The Senate must act,” the vice-president said in Atlanta, Georgia. Harris warned that future generations would one day ask us what we did to protect democracy, framing this moment as a crucial inflection point in American history. “They will ask us not about how we felt. They will ask us, what did we do?” Harris said. “We cannot tell them that we let a Senate rule stand in the way of our most fundamental freedom.”“Anti-voters laws are not new in our nation, but we must not be deceived into thinking they’re normal,” Harris said. “There is nothing normal about a law that makes it illegal to pass out water or food to people standing in long voting lines.” The vice-president urged Americans not to be complacent about the enactment of voting restrictions, warning that Republicans were trying to “interfere with our elections to get the outcomes they want”. “Do not succumb to those who would dismiss this assault on voting rights as an unfounded threat,” Harris said. “If we stand idly by, our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come.” Attendees included students wearing maroon-colored Morehouse face masks and members of Vice President Kamala Harris’ Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Outside nearly a dozen people waved signs in protest of the administration’s appearance on campus.  Prior to the event beginning, Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were seen riding through a crowd of attendees on a golf cart.  Despite being inaccurately introduced as Martin Luther King High School, the drum line from Southwest Dekalb High School performed. The band had been silently practicing for its big moment for more than an hour before the event began.  The event took place at the Atlanta University Center consortium on the Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College’s campus in southwest Atlanta’s West End neighborhood. The AUC consortium is comprised of four HBCUS, including Spelman and Morris Brown college.  Spelman college SGA president Jillian Jackson invoked the activist legacies of Julian Bond, Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams who attended schools within the Atlanta University Center consortium while introducing the president and vice president. The president and vice-president were introduced by Jillian Jackson, the student body president at the historically Black Spelman College. Jackson recounted her pride when she registered to vote at an NAACP drive, and she lamented the challenges that many Americans face in trying to access the ballot box. As Harris stepped up to the podium, she told Jackson, “I can’t wait to see what you do next.”“I have been very reluctant since being here to talk at all about changing the filibuster, and if we were here today talking about a policy issue, I wouldn’t be at this podium,” King said at a press conference on Capitol Hill. “But we’re not talking about a policy issue. We’re talking about a structural issue. we’re talking about how our system works.” The Maine senator quoted the British historian Arnold Toynbee, who once said, “Civilizations commit suicide they’re not murdered.” “I don’t want to see that happen in the United States of America,” King said. One journalist asked Biden for his message to supporters who are disappointed that Democrats have not already done more on voting rights. Another reporter asked Biden whether he has the votes necessary to pass a bill. “Keep the faith,” Biden replied. As of now, it appears that Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer does not have the votes necessary to amend the filibuster, which would clear the way for Democrats to pass a voting rights bill.  The president and the vice-president laid a wreath at the crypt after meeting with members of the King family, including Dr Bernice A King and Martin Luther King III, two of Dr King’s children. Biden and Harris are now visiting Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr King was once a pastor, before they deliver their speeches on voting rights this afternoon. In a statement released earlier today, Martin Luther King III said, “We are hopeful that after tomorrow’s trip to our home state, the President will honor my father’s legacy by traveling back to Washington and using every political chip he has to ensure the filibuster doesn’t obstruct the right to vote for Black and Brown Americans.”As a reminder, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer cannot afford any defections if he wants to amend the filibuster because the upper chamber is evenly ided, 50-50, between Democrats and Republicans. And if Democrats cannot change Senate rules, they almost certainly cannot pass voting rights bills, as Republicans have repeatedly used the filibuster to block those proposals. Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, urged lawmakers to prioritize the fate of American democracy over their desire for bipartisanship. “Bipartisanship is wonderful when it works. But it must never come at the cost of democracy,” Johnson said on Twitter. “Getting voting rights legislation to the president’s desk has got to be the top priority above anything else.” That means Schumer could bring up either the Freedom to Vote Act or the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act for a vote in the US senate. Both bills still will require the support of at least 60 senators to proceed because of the longstanding senate rule called the filibuster. If Republicans again block the bill, which they are expected to do, Schumer will likely move to have a vote to change the rules around the filibuster. Fellow Democrats have discussed a number of possible tweaks to the rule to overcome Republican obstruction. It’s still not clear if Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, two key Democrats who support keeping the filibuster in place, would support those measures. Schumer has pledged a vote on the voting rights measure no later than 17 January, a federal holiday in the US to celebrate the life and work of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s high-stakes visit to Atlanta today is in danger of backfiring horribly after exasperated voting rights activists in Georgia first warned them not come there just for more speeches without a “concrete plan” to get the relevant legislation passed in the Senate and then, when no signal was forthcoming about such a plan, basically decided to boycott the event. The president and vice president are both with the family of Martin Luther King III now, the son of civil rights icon Dr Martin Luther King Jr, for a private meeting, having laid a wreath at the civil rights icon’s tomb in Atlanta moments ago. “If we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will,” Powell said during a hearing of the Senate banking committee, which is considering his nomination for a second four-year term. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.During his questioning, Paul accused Fauci of using government resources to attack other health experts who disagreed with him on coronavirus-related policies.  “In usual fashion, you are distorting everything about me,” Fauci told Paul. “You keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance to reality.” Fauci argued that Paul’s attacks had distracted from the work necessary to get the pandemic under control, while also endangering him and his family. “That kindles the crazies out there,” Fauci said. “I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family and my children with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Fauci also noted that Paul has fundraised off calls for his resignation, encouraging supporters to donate to his campaign if they believe the expert should be fired. “Go to Rand Paul website and you see ‘Fire Dr. Fauci’ with a little box that says contribute here,” Fauci said. “So you are making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.”“Fifty Republican senators, the largest possible minority, have been sent here to represent the many millions of Americans whom Leader Schumer wants so badly to leave behind,” McConnell said in a floor speech moments ago. “So if my colleague tries to break the Senate to silence those millions of Americans, we will make their voices heard in this chamber in ways that are more inconvenient for the majority and this White House than what anybody has seen in living memory.” Republicans could theoretically throw up more procedural roadblocks to delay the confirmation of Joe Biden’s nominees and block the passage of routine bills. “What would a post-nuclear Senate look like? I assure you it would not be more efficient or more productive,” McConnell said. “I personally guarantee it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f8d32086b6fd0ac881349b420a346dd8dea2f49/146_100_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad64e1d56d682a6611a2801c76f9beea\"","title":"covid news live pfizer says omicron specific vaccine could be available by march mexico president tests positive again","story":"Images and videos have appeared on social media purportedly showing people purposefully trying to catch Covid at a time convenient to them.

We’ll start in Quebec, Canada’s second-most populous province, where residents who refuse to get vaccinated against Covid for non-medical reasons could face a “significant” financial penalty.  Quebec’s premier François Legault made the announcement today, describing the measures as a “health-care contribution” though the exact amount has not yet been determined. He told reporters:  The health tax will apply to all adults in Quebec who refuse to get their first vaccine dose “in the next few weeks”. The new measure comes as Quebec’s hospitals find themselves increasingly stretched with more admissions driven by the Omicron variant and staff absences.In a radio interview with Newstalk, the minister for health, Stephen Donnelly, said he had received updated advice on coronavirus restrictions that would be considered by his cabinet colleagues on Wednesday. He said: Boosted immunity means people who have had two doses of a vaccine and a confirmed diagnosis of Covid in the last three months, Donnelly said. Donnelly said he would also propose that certain age groups with a positive rapid antigen test no longer need a PCR test to confirm the result. The isolation period for those who test positive is set to be standardised at seven days, regardless of whether they have received a booster vaccination.The confirmed record figure for new cases is 368,149. The strike led by the Snuipp-FSU union, the largest among primary school teachers, comes after the latest of several changes on testing and isolation requirements for potential Covid cases announced by Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday. After seeing long queues of parents outside pharmacies and labs in recent days to test children in classes where a case was detected, Castex said home tests could now be used to determine if a student could return to school. But teachers say class disruptions have become unmanageable with the spread of the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant, especially since many parents remain unable to get vaccination appointments for children over five, available only since late December. “Students cannot learn properly because attendance varies wildly, and a hybrid of in-house and distance learning is impossible to put in place,” the Snuipp-FSU said, adding that absent teachers are not being replaced. It is also demanding the government provide facemasks for staff, including the more protective FFP2 masks, and CO2 monitors to check if classrooms are sufficiently ventilated. “Not only does the current protocol not protect students, staff or their families, it has completely disorganised schools,” the union said, claiming that classes have effectively been turned into “daycare centres.” The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said the government is doing everything possible to avoid outright school closures that could cause havoc for parents and jeopardise learning for thousands, especially those in low-income families.There were 137 deaths related to coronavirus in the same period, the data showed. In late December, daily cases stood at around 20,000. It also announced another 294 Covid-related deaths.  Italy has registered 139,559 deaths linked to the virus since its outbreak emerged in February 2020, and has reported 7.77 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care - stood at 17,067 up from 16,340 a day earlier. There were 185 admissions to intensive care units, against 114 on Monday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,677 from a previous 1,606. Speaking at a webinar organised by the Local Government Association, they noted that, just as those from poorer backgrounds suffered a disproportionately high number of Covid infections, many of those affected by long Covid also came from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Dr Aiden Fowler, the national director of patient safety in England, said:  Dr Dagmar Zeuner, the director of public health in the London borough of Merton, added that people working in occupations that brought them into contact with infected iniduals, and who had little control over their environment, had already borne the brunt of infections. She said: “Now, these are also the ones that carry the burden of long Covid, so they are suffering to keep their jobs.” Yet, they were not necessarily getting equal access to the long Covid clinics set up to help rehabilitate them. Zeuner said:  Their comments echo the findings of a report published last year, which suggested towns in north-west England were facing a growing health and economic crisis due to high numbers of long Covid cases.Serbia reported 13,693 new cases and 22 deaths.

It is understood to be examining other contingency plans.Under current plans, students sitting the 2022 State exams would see adjustments and more choice on their exam papers to account for the pandemic impact on education over the past two years.There will also be two sets of Leaving Cert exams held during the summer to cater for those who are sick with Covid-19 or are in isolation.However, the Irish Second-Level Students’ Union (ISSU) said on Tuesday that the State exams “cannot go ahead as planned” this year due to Covid-related disruption.‘Complete disregard’It said a move to proceed with traditional exam would suggest a “complete disregard for students’ best interests”.Emer Neville, ISSU president, said this year’s cohort of exam students has been “very vocal about the disruption they are facing in and out of the classroom”.“There is no online tuition provided to those isolating, and students have missed class time throughout 2021 and 2020 as a result of school closures,” she said.The intervention is regarded by observers as significant development on a building issue, with Labour and Sinn Féin having already called for the reintroduction of the hybrid exam model.Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, also said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.Separately, an academic who part of an independent steering committee which oversaw the use of calculated grades in 2020 said any move towards a hybrid model along the lines of last year’s exams “might be impossible”.Prof Michael O’Leary, of DCU’s centre for assessment research, policy and practice in education, said estimation approaches have been used in international comparative studies on student achievement known as Pisa and Timss.However, he said implementing this in the case of the Leaving Cert in 2022 “might be impossible” given that crucial data required to estimate Junior Cycle grades for students who did not sit the exam would not be available such as gender, school, etc.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) have both said they will only support the traditional, externally-assessed exams.The Department of Education said it is “ aware of the disruption” experienced by students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022.However, it said adjustments to the assessment arrangements for this year’s exams – including increased choice – were designed to take account of the disruption to learning last year, “as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 202122”.“The Department will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate 2022,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 self isolation and testing rules to change as 19 290 new cases reported","story":"The 14-day incidence last week hit its highest level in the pandemic, at 4,450 cases per 100,000 people, but Tony Holohan’s estimate is even higher at it takes account of testing constraints and undetected infections. Photograph: T NarayanBloombergUp to 500,000 Irish people were likely to have been infected with Covid-19 last week, according to a January 6th letter from chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The likely prevalence of active infection was 5.7-9.6 per cent, equivalent to between one in 10 and one in 20 of the population, Dr Holohan told Mr Donnelly in the same letter.Its contents emerged as 19,290 new cases of the virus were confirmed on Tuesday. As of 8am Tuesday morning, there were 1,062 patients in the country’s hospitals with 92 of those in ICU.In spite of the continued high case numbers Mr Donnelly has said that people who have received a positive Covid-19 antigen test result will no longer need to receive a confirmatory PCR test.Up until now a positive antigen result required people to get a PCR test to confirm the positive result, but the change will free up space in the testing system.Mr Donnelly also confirmed he plans to brings plans to Cabinet that will remove the five day isolation period for close contacts of confirmed cases, if the inidual has been given their Covid-19 booster.Mr Donnelly told Newstalk FM that he received the recommendations on Tuesday afternoon in a new letter dated January 11th from Dr Holohan.Close contacts who have not received a booster and have been in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case, will now have to isolate for seven days.For those who have actually tested positive themselves, the isolation period will now be reduced from 10 days to seven for everyone. Previously it was seven days for people who had a booster, and ten for people who did not.In addition, any person who has not received a booster shot, but who has had Covid-19 in the last three months will not have to restrict their movements for five days if they are a close contact of a confirmed case. This is set to have a major impact as a huge number of people will now not need to restrict their movements if they are deemed to be close contacts in the coming weeks.“The recommendation is that the confirmatory PCR test would be removed. I think that’s very positive. It makes it easier for people, they don’t have to go and get a second test, and it frees up some of the pressure on the PCR system as well because obviously we want people to be able to get those PCR tests as quickly as possible. So that’s the first main major change,” Mr Donnelly said.“The second one which I think will be welcomed as well is the isolation period: so if you get your test and you test positive, currently, for those who are boosted the recommendation is they isolate for seven days and unboosted for 10 days. The recommendation is that it just becomes seven days for everybody.”On the removal the five day restriction of movement for close contacts, he said: “I think this is the one that will affect most people. If you have boosted immunity, currently, you’re asked to restrict your movements for five days. That requirement would go completely, so no restricted movement if you have boosted immunity. Now, the recommendation is still obviously that there is regular antigen testing for several days. During that period people would also wear the higher grade masks.“And also if you don’t have boosted immunity, the time that you’re going to restrict your movements was 10 days. The recommendation is that would move down to seven days and obviously you still do the regular tests and where the higher grade masks.”Highest incidence rateThe 14-day incidence rate for the virus last week hit its highest level in the pandemic, at 4,450 cases per 100,000 people, but Dr Holohan’s estimate is even higher at it takes account of testing constraints and undetected infections.Covid-19 cases in hospital are growing at about 7 per cent per day, Dr Holohan says in the letter sent to Mr Donnelly on January 6th. Incidence is high across all age groups and is higher than at any time in the pandemic in all but the oldest age groups, he says. Test positivity has also increased in those aged 65 years and older in recent weeks.“Medical grade and respirator masks, if properly worn, offer greater protection than cloth masks anyone who wishes to wear a medical grade or respirator mask instead of a cloth mask should do so, so long as whichever mask they choose is well-fitting and worn properly.”People who are over 60 or are medically vulnerable, who are currently advised to wear a medical mask in confined spaces, “may prefer to wear a respirator mask,” Nphet now advises.Officials also say “ideally” a respirator or medical-grade mask, and not a cloth mask, should be worn by anyone: with a confirmed diagnosis during their infectious period with symptoms who is a household contact of a confirmed case or who is visiting a healthcare setting or visiting those who are vulnerable to Covid-19.Dr Holohan says Nphet will prepare a report before its next meeting (next week) that will allow for a better understanding of the severity of Omicron, the impact of vaccination and boosters and other “important measures” of the impact of Covid-19 on the health system.“While the current situation is dynamic and there are still a number of important uncertainties, we have the benefit of a year’s data on Covid-19 vaccines, and it is timely to reassess our strategic priorities for Covid-19 immunisation in the near and medium term.”Test and trace capacityAccording to the letter, the test and trace system is now operating at surge capacity and under “severe pressure”. However, the number of deaths and ICU admissions linked to Covid-19 remains stable.Dr Holohan says the recent increase in incidence and hospitalisation has not “as yet” translated into increased critical care admissions or deaths. Potential contributory factors including the age profile of recent cases, the protection conferred by immunity from vaccines and infection and the “lower intrinsic virulence” of Omicron compared with previous variants.The number of hospital-acquired infections continues to be of concern, according to Dr Holohan, with 36 recorded in the week to December 26th last.There has been a significant increase in confirmed cases among hospital staff 704 in the week to December 26th.Some 80.5 per cent of reported antigen test results are currently confirmed through PCR testing.In early January 96 per cent of new Covid-19 cases were due to the Omicron variant, according to the letter, and 718 cases of Omicron have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing.So far this winter, 37 flu cases have been notified, while notifications of RSV dropped by 75 per cent at the end of 2021.Dr Holohan says 49 per cent of those in hospital are fully vaccinated, as are 40 per cent of those in ICU.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"westmeath had highest rate of covid 19 over christmas period","story":"Covid-19 incidence rate highest in Westmeath, Clare and Kilkenny during Christmas. Photograph: iStockThe level of Covid-19 varied significantly between counties over the Christmas period, with some having an incidence rate that’s four times higher than others, new data shows.The latest weekly epidemiology report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), examining between December 26th and January 1st, shows the surge in cases over the Christmas period as the highly-transmissible Omicron variant took hold of the country.Westmeath had the highest incidence rate by a significant margin that week at 3056.2 cases per 100,000 population.This was followed by Clare, with an incidence of 1,974 per 100,000, Kilkenny at 1,855.2 per 100,000, and 1,820 per 100,000 population in Longford.Kerry had the lowest incidence rate at 884.9 per 100,000 population, according to the HPSC report.This was followed by Wexford at 956.4 per 100,000, Waterford at 1042.4 per 100,000 and Cavan at 1058.1 per 100,000.Record casesThe latest surge in cases had an impact on many families’ Christmas celebrations around the country, as a record number of daily cases were notified on several days throughout the festivities.The infection rates meant many people had to self-isolate in their room and celebrate alone, while close contacts had to restrict their movements instead of meeting friends or family.The HPSC report states, however, that the true scale of infection has not been recorded and is “artificially reduced”, due to demand for testing outstripping capacity and due to reduced services at Christmas.According to official figures, 65,044 people contracted the virus during Christmas week, though public health experts have estimated that the true number is two or three times that figure.However, while the number of cases increased substantially, the number of people being admitted to ICU remained relatively stable, with early indications that the Omicron variant may not be as severe as its predecessor Delta.Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of the virus surpassed the one million mark on Monday, as a further 23,909 cases of Covid-19 were reported.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"animal carcass and rodent infestation found in dublin takeaway","story":"Rodent infestation at a takeaway in Co Dublin posed a ‘grave and immediate danger’ to customers, says FSAI.

The order was later lifted on December 21st.In its inspector’s report, the FSAI identified a significant amount of rodent droppings throughout the waste and food storage room, as well as the carcass of an unknown, animal.The inspector said the presence of rodents was a danger to public health, because they can transmit many harmful pathogens to foods and packaging through droppings and urine.CockroachesSeparately, a closure order was also issued to DFC Take Away on Dorset street, in Dublin city with the inspector finding cockroaches and shortcomings in terms of hygiene and cleanliness.In a letter to the business, the inspector said there were live cockroaches found in a cockroach bait trap in the premises, which has been a “persistent issue and concern” and pest control procedures were “not robust”. The closure order was issued on December 10th, and lifted four days later.In total, the authority issued 59 enforcement orders on food businesses for breaches of food safety legislation last year, an increase of 40 per cent compared to the previous year largely due to temporary lockdown closures of many businesses in 2020.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland to lift covid restriction on large outdoor events from monday","story":"Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped to lift other Covid related restrictions in the coming weeks.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via GettyAs a Republican lost the presidential election, letting Joe Biden into the White House, the future was the left’s to author. Governments had just intervened to the tune of several percentage points of national output to save livelihoods. What could be fairly described as a contagion had torn through a dangerously globalised world. No crisis like it had been seen since the first half of the 20th century.In the end, the financial crisis of 2008 did not inaugurate a progressive imperium across the democratic West. The left misread public support for emergency measures as a lasting shift to their way of thinking. To judge by today’s stalled and overambitious Biden presidency, it has repeated the error. Extrication from this mess is still entirely possible. But the left has to accept that a revolution that seemed at hand when the pandemic began is probably not coming.It can start by no longer talking about the pre-pandemic world as a Dickensian ordeal. Whatever the uses of alliteration, Build Back Better is an odd name for a social-spending bill. It assumes a widespread disillusion with the status quo ante that tallies with nothing in survey data or the collective memory. According to Gallup, 70 per cent of Americans in 2019 felt it was a good time to find a “quality job”, far more than at the peak of the previous boom. About 12 per cent named economic issues as the nation’s main problem.Defaming that period does not just breed overconfidence about the public appetite for structural change, it also forfeits the credit that Democrats (including Biden, as vice-president from 2009 to 2017) should be sharing for the pre-pandemic economy. Republicans are being left to “own” an era that was, if not a paradise lost, then the last normal time most people remember.‘Miserable’ normalityThe weird negativity about the recent past does not end there. According to a thousand unsmiling think pieces, the “Great Resignation” is proof of the public’s long-suppressed qualms with the nature of work and of capitalism itself. You wouldn’t know that, of the job-quitters, many are moving to higher-paid vacancies in an economy that is ravenous for labour. Or that low-wage staff in leisure and hospitality are among the winners. Such exploitation of demand and supply is a case of the system working, surely, and not of its reputational crisis.At play here is one of the left’s less attractive qualities: the attribution of misery to what are just normal lives. In this account, the supermajority of Americans who consistently tell the General Social Survey they are “very” or “moderately” satisfied with their jobs are the dupes of false consciousness. “McJob”, that masterpiece of condescension, is a phrase that only recently stopped doing the rounds. As for “burnout”, it now covers the stress of office life and the strain of working from home.At the risk of succumbing to the psycho-jargon of the day, Democratic anger at Joe Manchin – the senator who is delaying Build Back Better – is classic “transference”. The party’s real quarrel is with an electorate that failed to give it the clear Senate majority that some polls had anticipated in 2020. Stuffed BillThe response to that disappointment should have been a pruning of legislative ambitions. There was still more than enough support for wider healthcare coverage and paid leave, among other incremental reforms. Instead, the party went for so crammed a Bill that, even if it passes, as it soon might, voters will have no clear sense of what they have gained.For the second time in this young century, progressives have assumed rather than achieved a sea-change in public sentiment. Such turning points are extraordinarily rare. There was one after the second World War, which gave rise to the Keynesian state. There was a laissez-faire reaction against it after the Opec oil crises of the 1970s. In the decades since there has been nothing like as abrupt or far-reaching a turn. If and when another comes, don’t take for granted that it will be in a progressive direction.With an election in the offing, the left remains a dormant electoral force in France. In the UK it has only recently started to trouble a Conservative party in its 12th year in power.

It is even more unusual to see a two-year period with mortality so far above the preceding five-year average. We have to go back eighty years to 1940-41 to find such an extreme period on this measure.”Although The Great Depression saw a rise in mortality of about 10 per cent in 1929, rates had dropped back by 1930, with the average of the two years only being two per cent above the prior five-year average.The figures are estimates and the final data will be crunched when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases final figures on Tuesday.Overall, deaths in 2021 were just one per cent higher than the 10-year average, but experts said that a drop in mortality would be expected over time, so even a small rise was worrying.Figures show that before 2020, no year has had higher mortality rates than the 10-year average since 1963.In 2021, more deaths were registered in England and Wales than in any year since the Eighties, apart from 2020.There are likely to be between 585,000 and 590,000 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2021. In contrast, 2020 was the first year since 1918 to see more than 600,000 deaths.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39Abu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc staff need put viewpoints dont like not subscribe cancel","story":"BBC staff must put up with views they don’t like on issues such as transgender rights because the corporation does not subscribe to cancel culture, one of its senior executives has said.David Jordan, the BBC’s director of editorial policy and standards, said that identity should not trump impartiality and employees should “leave their prejudice at the door”.He was appearing before a House of Lords select committee where Lord Lipsey, the Labour peer, asked how the BBC would deal with the thorny issue of trans rights, when the two opposing sides “are not just not on speaking terms, they actually want the other lot silenced”.Mr Jordan replied: “We are very committed to making sure that viewpoints are heard from all different sorts of perspectives and that we don’t subscribe to the cancel culture that some groups would put forward.”He said that the BBC is “committed to freedom of expression, we’re committed to reflecting all viewpoints - that is our job.“Whether or not some members of our staff like it is not the point. The point is that they have to adhere to that too, and they leave their prejudice at the door when they arrive and need to be prepared to hear viewpoints which personally they don’t agree with and might disagree with strongly.”Mr Jordan said that “identity is the hard edge of impartiality, in current circumstances, whether you’re talking about gender identity, racial identity, whatever identity you’re talking about. There is undoubtedly an issue about whether or not people regard impartiality as trumping identity, or the other way around”.Tim Davie, the director-general, appeared before the same committee and said that the BBC made “reasonable progress” last year in “culturally resetting the BBC”, including a renewed focus on impartiality.Mr Davie said he was confident that Deborah Turness, the incoming CEO of news and current affairs, will ensure that BBC journalism is strictly impartial.“If I had any doubt at all that a director of news candidate could not flawlessly and actively deploy with deep understanding our impartiality brief, I wouldn’t have hired them and I think Deborah Turness will be outstanding at delivering on this brief,” he said.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inAbu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotCovid loses \u0026#3990pc of its infectiousness within five minutes of being airborne\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british council envoy gave female colleague normal italian farewell","story":"A British Council chief whose normal Italian farewell led to him being sacked after he was accused of drunkenly groping a colleague has won an unfair dismissal case.Paul Sellers, head of the cultural relations body in Italy, was dismissed over accusations he kissed a woman on the lips before “stroking” her breasts as she left a social event at his flat in Rome in 2018. But the tribunal heard from several witnesses who said the respected envoy - whose wife and children were next to him at the time of the alleged incident - had given her nothing more than a kiss on each cheek in the traditional Italian style.The woman, a consular employee, complained to the British Council, which carried out an internal investigation and ultimately fired Mr Sellers after 30 years of service in 2019.Mr Sellers, who became the British Council\u0027s country director for Italy in 2014, took legal action against the organisation for unfair dismissal. An employment tribunal has now concluded he was subjected to a “seriously flawed” investigation. The tribunal found that investigators ignored evidence, dismissed the accounts of six witnesses who saw nothing untoward and instead chose to believe the “hazy” account of the complainant - despite admitting they were not “100 per cent sure what happened”.Mr Sellers, who held a post that usually comes with an £80,000 salary, is now expected to receive compensation from the British Council over his treatment. About 50 people attended the Christmas party on December 16 2018. Mr Sellers was seen dancing after drinking two or three glasses of wine, the tribunal in London was told.His accuser, named only in proceedings as ZZ, said goodbye to Mr Sellers in the kitchen area around 4.30pm as she left, the hearing was told. The next day, she alleged that she had been sexually harassed.She told the tribunal: As I went to kiss him goodbye he kissed me twice on the side of my mouth (rather than the cheek) and then he stroked my breasts with both his hands.I was very shocked so I didn\u0027t respond immediately and left the party.Mr Sellers, who lived in Rome with wife, was left stunned when informed about the allegations and vehemently denied them.He told investigators that people would get a kiss on both cheeks as they left his flat, but explained he was busy giving Italian farewell greetings - salutos - to lots of iniduals and therefore had “no specific recollection” of saying goodbye to ZZ.Nonetheless, an investigation was launched by the British Council, led by Kate Ewart-Biggs, its deputy chief executive, who concluded she “had no reason to believe” the woman was lying. The tribunal, however, found the investigation took a “narrow view” of the alleged incident, failed to explore the alleged contact and the circumstances surrounding it, made no attempt to interview possible witnesses and assumed nobody else saw it.She accepted ZZ\u0027s account, even though it had changed throughout the investigation, the panel concluded.Mr Sellers provided witness statements to back up his version of events at the appeal stage, but his case was thrown out by Sir Ciarán Devane, then head of the British Council.One onlooker, Monica Marziota, who was next to the pair as they said goodbye, said she saw a “completely normal Italian farewell”, adding: The limited physical contact was brief, friendly and straightforward.”He said: No reasonable employer would have failed to seek the relevant contemporaneous documentation, or to explore the circumstances of the alleged assault, or to seek relevant evidence from witnesses to the alleged incident.”He said the evidence from witnesses was, on the face of it, “relevant, clear, and compelling”, adding: “If that evidence had been accepted by the British Council, I can see no rational basis on which it could continue to find there had been a sexual assault, as described by ZZ.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39Abu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"building firms must take responsibility","story":"The principle of “polluter pays” is a long established means of recouping costs and ensuring that the taxpayer does not pick up the bill for the shortcomings of others. It also helps protect those who face serious financial difficulties to clear up problems for which they were not responsible. The cladding scandal that arose out of the Grenfell Tower fire disaster in 2017 is a case in point. Thousands of leaseholders living in high and medium-rise buildings were left in fear for their safety and in despair for their financial wellbeing. Until the cladding is removed, many of their homes are at risk and unsellable.These leaseholders face huge bills through no fault of their own. Under an earlier attempt to address this unfairness, no one living in a high-rise block would have to pay for the removal and replacement of cladding, while leaseholders in lower-rise buildings were to be offered low-interest loans capped at £50 a month. Michael Gove, who assumed the housing brief last year, has taken a different approach. He says the costs should fall much more heavily on the construction industry — a policy shift that saw £1 billion wiped off property company shares yesterday.He has given builders just a few weeks to come up with a scheme to contribute £4 billion to a fund that will repair unsafe buildings between 11 and 18 metres high (the Government has already committed £5  billion of public money to remove cladding from taller buildings, backed by an industry levy). Mr Gove threatened them with a new tax if they failed to comply.It should not be necessary to use such a heavy-handed approach. The construction industry has done well in recent years, benefiting from taxpayer-subsidised help to buy schemes, and should be prepared to reach an accommodation to help the cladding group. Mr Gove is principally after those who mis-sold cladding but since many have gone out of business, this might be impossible to do other than through a further levy on the entire industry.There are obvious holes in the plan, including what happens to people living in buildings under 11 metres and who pays for other non-cladding measures now being demanded by lenders, such as fire breaks and insulation. Mr Gove was right to say using the tax system was “a blunt instrument”. But if the builders won’t recognise their responsibilities, he may have no option.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39Abu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid loses 90pc infectiousness within five minutes airborne","story":"Coronavirus loses 90 per cent of its infectiousness within five minutes of becoming airborne, a new study has suggested. Preliminary data from the University of Bristol reveals that in a real world situation the conditions of the air dry out the viral particles.The team measured how stable SARS-CoV-2 droplets — the virus which causes Covid — are over time, ranging from five seconds to 20 minutes.“A decrease in infectivity to approximately 10 per cent of the starting value was observable for SARS-CoV-2 over 20 minutes, with a large proportion of the loss occurring within the first 5 minutes after aerosolisation,” the scientists write in the paper.The findings indicate that the virus does not survive for long outside the warm and damp environment of a host\u0027s respiratory system, and loses its potency rapidly in the wild.The study, which has not yet been published in full or peer-reviewed, shows that in air with 50 per cent humidity, akin to that circulated in large buildings, there is a “near instant loss of infectivity in 50 to 60 per cent of the virus”.At much higher humidity, the droplet does not dry out instantly and remains fluid for longer, which means the virus remains stable and infectious for two minutes.However, even under these favourable conditions the virus loses 90 per cent of its infectiousness after ten minutes.Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the study suggests airborne spread “may not be as important as some have thought”.More from NewsScientists believed Covid leaked from Wuhan lab - but feared debate could hurt ‘international harmony’Pressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu now geopolitical irrelevance","story":"Russian and American representatives are discussing, and perhaps deciding, the future security of Europe. High-level meetings are not always significant. Participants are sometimes inadequately briefed, tired, and in a hurry to announce success at a press conference. But occasionally, such meetings can be very important indeed.I am reading Tim Bouverie’s vivid history of 1930s appeasement. Central to that disaster, as he shows, was the chronic incapacity of Neville Chamberlain and his closest advisors to understand what kind of men Hitler and Mussolini were, despite the reality, quite literally, staring them in the face. Sometimes, politicians have to judge their opponents. What do they really want? Are they bluffing? Can they be trusted? Perhaps this has to be done by people looking each other in the eye. Chamberlain was absurdly confident that he had succeeded with Hitler. It matters a lot that the Americans do better in their meetings with the Russians this week.It also matters who else is in the room. In 1938, the Czechs were excluded from the Munich conference and the French were marginalised. This time, the EU has been excluded from the talks in Geneva: an astonishing void – except that no one seems to be astonished. In a matter that so fundamentally affects its security – the future of Ukraine as an independent state – the EU is on the sidelines.One might argue that Nato is the actor here, and hence that US-Russia discussions are the obvious step. But what does that tell us about the EU’s repeated ambition to be a major independent actor on the world stage?Federalists such as Emmanuel Macron (who has declared Nato “brain dead”) would doubtless say that this proves their case: only when it has real sovereign powers and its own armed forces will the EU count. Perhaps. But at the moment this is fantasy. France is the only bloc member with considerable armed forces. Much of the EU has allowed itself to become dependent on Russia for energy. Several larger members are in a political and legal standoff with Brussels.If Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine, will that pull EU states together, or – as seems equally likely – drive them apart? Somehow I cannot see Ursula von der Leyen issuing a clarion call to resist the aggressor. It’s Nato or nothing and weakening Nato is Russia’s main object.As for Britain, its position is, as always, that of Europe’s leading Nato member. As such we are assisting Ukraine to strengthen its defences, and maintaining a military presence in the Baltic states to show that aggression will not be a walkover. In what sense have we lost “influence” by leaving the EU?The problem with the EU, in geopolitical terms, is its vulnerability political, economic and military. It is incapable of ensuring the security of its own frontiers or its “near abroad” – the preoccupation of every empire in history. Some people used to fear (some still do) that the EU was a superpower in the making which Britain could not afford to stay out of. The reality is that for the foreseeable future it will remain largely impotent.We have an interest in a stable, secure and confident EU. It would be a better neighbour, able to accept Brexit and build a positive future relationship. But its own uncertainties make it want to punish Britain “pour encourager les autres”. It seems unable to accept its limitations and try to function as an economic union of sovereign states. It pursues an illusory federalism without democratic consent.EU politicians have clearly given up on winning popular support for the “European project”. Instead, they rely on the Court of Justice, the Central Bank and the secretive Council to build an unaccountable technocracy. Such a shallow system is doomed to weakness.In Britain the debate – if it can be called that – drags on. Rejoiners still flourish every anecdote, however trivial, to prove that “Brexit is a failure”. At no point do they discuss the EU’s direction and whether we would ever again want to be part of a faltering and increasingly post-democratic system. “Tell me one thing we have gained from Brexit,” they say triumphantly. Imagine Mrs Pankhurst being confronted by some red-faced reactionary in the 1920s: “Tell me one thing you women have gained from getting the vote!” I think we can guess her response.Robert Tombs is the author, most recently, of ‘This Sovereign Isle’More from NewsScientists believed Covid leaked from Wuhan lab - but feared debate could hurt ‘international harmony’Pressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living virus means living unvaccinated","story":"No one much likes Novak Djokovic. Even when he wins, he loses, with crowds loudly willing his opponent on. His astonishing resilience on court is dismissed as robotic, his superhuman fitness a form of sneering at more frail, fallible mortals.That public antipathy may initially have blinded the world to the grotesque treatment he endured in Australia. One thing is certain, it would never have happened to Roger Federer. But there is something deeply chilling about the sight of a man deemed a political threat, on his own, being spirited away by the heavies at an airport. It is the kind of thing that happens to Alexei Navalny flying into Moscow, not the world No 1 tennis player arriving to defend his title in a liberal democracy.Yet his youth and fitness are a reminder of why some vaccine strategies have gone off the rails, not just in Australia, but in Europe too. For the evidence suggests that whether it is a young tennis player, or young drinkers out trying to enjoy themselves, the wrong people are being targeted by harsh vaccine restrictions around the world.Djokovic challenges a draconian Covid strategy down under that has governed life for countless months. It is, as Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, points out, a strategy founded in the nation’s isolation, which has allowed it to pretend it can cut itself off from the pandemic. But as Wilkinson, himself half-English and half-Australian, also notes: “The difficulty was always going to be in sustaining that.”Like every other government, the Australian authorities are weighing up how to get back to normal life. Given we cannot eliminate the disease, the path to attaining this, says Wilkinson, is obvious: ensure enough people have enough immunity to prevent Covid posing a serious threat. “The question is how do you get from here to there?” The answer is building populations’ resistance through either vaccination or “natural immunity” – catching Covid and fighting it off. Or both. Djokovic argues that, having recently recovered from Covid, he benefits from natural immunity. But in a country where Covid has until recently been rare, and which has still recorded less than a million cases, compared to 14.5 million in the UK, natural immunity is dismissed. Vaccination is king.Even in the UK, where so many of us have caught the disease, this “natural immunity” defence is still officially considered suspect. Hence the Health Secretary Sajid Javid’s shock on being told last week by Steve James, an ICU consultant at Kings College Hospital, that James had not yet been vaccinated and did not want to be, because “the science is not strong enough”.It is easy to protest, as Dr Peter English, a former consultant in communicable disease control, did yesterday, that healthcare workers refusing vaccines are “irresponsible” because they risk both transmitting the disease to vulnerable patients and, potentially, falling ill and taking up an NHS bed themselves.Yet, on the risk of infection, as Dr Julian Tang, clinical virologist, respiratory sciences, at the University of Leicester, has pointed out, “natural infection with viruses generally provides longer lasting and broader immune protection, compared to vaccination”.And, on transmission, Javid’s own Department of Health has just released a study showing that while vaccines cut transmission for the original Covid strain, new strains see both vaccinated and unvaccinated people transmitting the virus at similar rates.This is, as Wilkinson is at pains to point out, not to suggest that immunity acquired from catching Covid is somehow preferable to getting a jab. The dangers of contracting Covid are far greater than any potential vaccine side effects. “I think there are strong reasons to have a vaccine for health professionals,” he says. “The question is whether it’s ethically justified to force people to have a vaccine if they have had a confirmed infection… because there is reasonable evidence that those who have had the vaccine and those who have had an infection have similar protection from infection and risk of passing on the virus.”Across the Atlantic, there are similar doubts. “If you listen to the language of our public health officials, they talk about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated,” Marty Makary, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University told the British Medical Journal last autumn, in an article reviewing a host of studies that described similar protection from vaccine and infection-led immunity. “If we want to be scientific, we should talk about the immune and the non-immune.”It is a distinction certain to become ever more stark, ever more fraught, because of the increasing use of vaccine mandates around the world by governments, schools and employers – Italy is even banning the unvaccinated from ski lifts. Ignoring infection history also throws broader government vaccination policy, beyond vaccine mandates, into doubt, in the UK as much as in Australia.Here, young people have been targeted with measures requiring them to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs. As many in the industry predicted, it appears to be having little effect. Latest ONS figures show the highest rates of infection among young adults. Indeed, a year into the vaccination campaign, it is beginning to become clear who is most in need of jabs and boosters. And the answer is the same as at the start of the pandemic. Then policy was framed as if the virus did not discriminate. It soon became clear this was not true. The elderly and those with co-morbidities were very much more at risk. The same people, it seems clear, should be the focus of vaccination campaigns.Indeed, demonising the unvaccinated, notably the young and fit, is almost certainly counter-productive. In the first six months of last year, 67 per cent of the population received at least their first jab. Since then, however, only another 10 per cent have come forward, leaving almost a quarter entirely unjabbed. Discounting children under 12, not yet eligible for a vaccine, that leaves up to six million Britons unjabbed. Many are teenagers and young adults, up to a third of whom are not fully vaccinated.But in some areas, particularly in London, over a quarter of over-60s are not double jabbed. Ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately. In the latest ONS figures, the lowest third-dose and booster vaccination coverage was among Pakistani (42.2 per cent), black Caribbean (44.4 per cent) and black African (45.4 per cent) ethnic groups. Almost all white people aged 80 and above are fully jabbed, while only four out of five black people over 80 are, which a government report last month blamed for higher death rates among minorities.These are the groups that would most benefit from the protection of vaccines. Yet coercion is unlikely to change their minds. Indeed, it is a blunt tool. In the latest ONS survey, fewer than two in 10 of those hesitant to have a vaccine said needing one to work or go on holiday might make them change their mind. The most persuasive reason, for the slim minority willing to countenance it, was altruism – to protect others.These millions are not anti-vaxxers – militant, headline-hogging campaigners calling doctors and nurses administering jabs murderers. But they are damned by association, making many even more reluctant to come forward now. Some GPs, like Dr Azhar Farooqi, in Leicester, have realised a less confrontational approach is required. Having noticed that many of his highest-risk patients, particularly from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds, were turning down the jab, he telephoned them personally for a reassuring chat. On the spot, 70 per cent changed their minds.It is the very opposite of the French president Emmanuel Macron’s decision to “p––– off” the unvaccinated, making it increasingly hard for them to live without it. Indeed, insisting people take vaccines to protect themselves is not just of questionable effectiveness, it is also morally wrong, says Wilkinson. “It’s a bad ethical reason, it’s a paternalistic reason, it says government knows better than you what to do with your own health.”More from NewsScientists believed Covid leaked from Wuhan lab - but feared debate could hurt ‘international harmony’Pressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"molly mae hague shouldnt have apologised speaking truth poverty","story":"If you had to advise somebody on how to achieve their dreams, what would you say? You do not need to spend hundreds of pounds on self-help books — or be an arch-Thatcherite — to see that having a vision for the future, setting yourself clear goals, taking personal responsibility and working hard are the surest ways to get ahead. Or so you might have thought.Last week, former Love Island star and multi-millionaire social media influencer Molly-Mae Hague sparked an intense backlash for arguing just that. “You’re given one life, and it’s down to you what you do with it,” she told the entrepreneur Steven Bartlett on his podcast The Diary of a CEO. “I understand that we all have different backgrounds…but I think if you want something enough, you can achieve it, it just depends on what lengths you want to go to get where you want to be.”Cue the outcry. She was furiously accused of being “tone-deaf”, “lacking in self-awareness” and failing to appreciate the barriers that some people face to success. One Twitter post that attracted thousands of likes caricatured her position as “if you’re homeless, buy a home”.I don’t quite know what they expected from a podcast titled The Diary of a CEO. An interviewee to say, “I’m rich because of my inherited wealth, power and connections and if you don’t have those things then there’s no point trying”?This isn’t to say that equality of opportunity is somehow perfect. We have come a long way in Britain, but it is still not difficult to find evidence suggesting that, in top fields such as politics, tech and the law, people who went to private school are still over-represented. Any decent society must take seriously the need to remove the barriers that make it difficult for some people to get ahead.But what we have today is the elevation of disempowering narratives which blame all disparities on systems, structures and unavoidable prejudice while people who seek to challenge these narratives are demonised.Molly-Mae was forced to back down on Monday, saying, “I apologise to the people that have been affected negatively.” I understand why she did say sorry, but I can’t help wishing she hadn’t. After all, while we cannot choose the circumstances of our birth, we can choose how we respond to them. We all have struggles, and of course some of us face worse things than others. But we also all have agency, and the power to make something of our lives.This isn’t just wishful thinking. The fact is that it works. Take the Michaela Community School in London.

But in a society that venerates victimhood and a “woe-is-me” mentality and where celebrities are more likely to opine about their right-on views on gender, race and sexuality, there’s something refreshing about a young, successful woman who simply says, “You’re given one life, and it’s down to you what you do with it.” She was absolutely right.More from NewsScientists believed Covid leaked from Wuhan lab - but feared debate could hurt ‘international harmony’Pressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second lockdown school closure set pupils back just starting","story":"The second lockdown school closure meant children lost the academic gains they made after their initial return to the classroom, an official Government study has found.When pupils were invited back to the classroom following the first national shutdown, they went on to make “some progress” in catching up in core subjects by the end of the autumn term in 2020, researchers said.But by the summer term of 2021, following the second period of school closures from January to March 2021, “some of these academic gains were seen to have been lost”, according to a major report from the Department for Education.The study, which summarised findings from research conducted over the course of the previous academic year, found that the biggest challenge secondary schools faced in helping pupils to recover from their lost learning was the state of pupils’ emotional and mental health and wellbeing.Meanwhile for primary schools, the biggest challenge was the “large differences in progress” between pupils - according to a poll of more than 1,000 education leaders by Ipsos Mori, which the DfE commissioned as part of its study.Researchers also noted that students who were stuck at home during the January to March lockdown of 2021 resented their peers who had been allowed to stay at school.“Unexpected behaviour issues also occurred in March in some cases, such as resentment or conflict from pupils learning from home towards those attending in person during lockdown,” the report said.Researchers noted that as the academic year progressed, primary and secondary school leaders reported that “disparities in pupils’ social, emotional and academic progress increased, with pupils having increasingly complex and variable needs”.Pupils from deprived backgrounds who did not attend school or engage with remote learning seem to have been “most profoundly impacted” by the pandemic, the report added.It came as official figures showed that around a quarter of catch-up tutoring courses for this academic year have been delivered by Randstad, the provider of the Government\u0027s flagship tuition scheme.More than 300,000 tutoring courses began last term - all of which were delivered “in-house” by schools, rather than with a third party tutoring company. Meanwhile, just 72,000 courses began under schemes coordinated by chosen provider Randstad, figures showed.Schools also experienced the highest number of teacher absences during the first week of term since height of the pingdemic last summer, official figures showed. Last Thursday, roughly one in  20 teachers (4.9 per cent) were off school for Covid-related reasons. That was the largest proportion since mid-July 2021, when close contacts were still required to self-isolate.More from NewsScientists believed Covid leaked from Wuhan lab - but feared debate could hurt ‘international harmony’Pressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time bust myth nicola sturgeon has had good pandemic","story":"“Scotland is to reduce the time for self-isolation from ten to seven days, bringing it into line with the rest of the UK.” I gasped and wondered whether I needed to adjust the TV. But no, finally, after all the carefully manufactured differentiations, the relentless spinning of a land apart narrative and the packaging of Sturgeon as the caring mother of the nation against those heartless, cavalier Tooarries in London, we have something closer to the UK wide response to the pandemic promised back in March 2020.When the history of Covid is written, the decision to legislate through the Health Act – which devolves power and responsibilities to the Home Nations – rather than through the Emergency Powers Act, which reserves major civil contingencies to Westminster, will be seen as a strategic error and perhaps the cause of a lasting fissure in the Union. As I have written in before, if we had had the same arrangements during the Battle of Britain we would have had the Prime Minister in London calling on us to fight them on the beaches and the First Minister in Edinburgh (perhaps the former SNP leader and wannabe Quisling Arthur Donaldson?) banning people from going to beaches at all. We have all been confused and disinclined to believe politicians as a result of the mixed messages. Historians will, in time, be able to make judgements based on a full UK wide Covid Inquiry, which will capture the lessons learned. But there is already hard evidence to support the thesis that Scottish Covid death statistics have never justified Sturgeon’s tighter approach, which has had a big impact on the Scottish economy as well as on national wellbeing. Despite the New Year crackdown in Scotland and relatively normal festivities in England, there are currently more cases north of the border. But, for a time, partly persuaded by a broadcast media that seemed determined to portray Sturgeon’s approach as statesmanlike in comparison to Boris Johnson’s, many people bought the lie that Scotland was dealing with Covid more effectively than England. For Sturgeon, the timing of the pandemic could not have been better. The Holyrood election in May 2021, coming on the back of scandal after scandal and her own near impeachment following the Salmond trial, could have been catastrophic. But Covid allowed her to campaign on a reputation of competence and – again with the media\u0027s apparent connivance – a free party political broadcast every afternoon, where journalists were carefully vetted and not allowed supplementary questions, unlike the Whitehall press conferences. But Sturgeon woke up with a Hogmanay headache. Despite all the advantages that Covid has given her, polls show support for separation from the UK declining. And within the independence movement there are an increasing number of Scots distancing themselves from the SNP, either through dislike of a narcissistic leader or distaste at the scandals which have struck the Party\u0027s hierarchy. For the moment Sturgeon seems intent on doubling down on differentiation with an authoritarian approach to mask wearing, possibly by copying the French policy of making mask wearing outside compulsory, and by going further on vaccine passports. Even while the evidence points towards relaxing restrictions. Please keep us Scots in your thoughts.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39Abu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk closer northern hemisphere country end covid pandemic","story":"The UK is the closest of any northern hemisphere country to exiting the Covid pandemic, an expert has said.Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, suggested in a Chatham House online briefing that the UK was seeing the virus become endemic.He said: In general now, the countries that we know best in the northern hemisphere have varying stages of the pandemic. And probably in the UK, it\u0027s the closest to any country of being out of the pandemic – if it isn\u0027t already out of the pandemic – and having the disease as endemic as the other four coronaviruses.It comes after Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, called for the UK to show the world how to move from pandemic to endemic.I hope we will be one of the first major economies to demonstrate to the world how you transition from pandemic to endemic, and then deal with this however long it remains with us, whether that’s five, six, seven, 10 years, said Mr Zahawi.Prof Heymann, a former World Health Organisation (WHO) assistant director general for health security and environment, said population immunity was already high.He added: That means immunity against serious illness and death after infection if one is vaccinated, or after re-infection if one has had illness before. And that population immunity seems to be keeping the virus and its variants at bay, not causing serious illness or death in countries where population immunity is high.And that, as I said, is keeping the virus at bay. And it\u0027s now functioning more like an endemic coronavirus than one that is a pandemic.Prof Heymann said many people who were getting seriously ill had not had a previous infection and had not been vaccinated.Asked whether the Covid pandemic is over globally, he said that would not be declared until all countries have completed what they need to do to make this virus more tame and to become endemic.The European arm of the WHO said the omicron variant represented a new tidal wave for Europe as forecasts suggested more than 50 per cent of people would be infected over the next six to eight weeks.Dr Hans Henri Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said people should be doing everything possible not to get infected in the first place.More from NewsPressure grows on Scotland Yard over failure to launch ‘partygate’ investigation‘I was in labour all alone’: What  readers did on day of lockdown-busting partyPressure grows on Boris Johnson’s private secretary amid claims of another boozy lockdown gatheringDramatic fall in burglaries after police sent to scene of every break-inBBC staff \u0026#39need to put up with viewpoints they don\u0026#39t like and not subscribe to cancel culture\u0026#39Abu Hamza’s son jailed for £342,000 money laundering plotMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules no10 staff held","story":"All the Covid rules as No staff held BYOB drinks - and what Tories were sayingThe PMs top aide emailed more than  Downing Street staff inviting them to \"make the most of the lovely weather\" with an evening do on May  Boris Johnson faces mounting questions over an alleged No bash during the first lockdown Image: Tolga Akmen Lnp REX ShutterstockByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Jan | comments Boris Johnson is embroiled in a fresh scandal over claims he attended a BYOB drinks party in the Downing Street garden during the first Covid lockdown.

Downing Street has refused to comment while top civil servant Sue Gray conducts an inquiry into allegations of a string of rule-breaking parties in . The latest revelations have dashed the Prime Ministeraposs hopes of putting the controversy behind him after a torrid few weeks in the run-up to Christmas.

Hereaposs what the rules were at the time - and what the public was being told while No partied.What were the Covid rules on May    Boris Johnson announced the first national lockdown on March , with everyone ordered to stay in their house unless they had a reasonable excuse, such as work.The stay at home order was eased in England on May , allowing people to take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.But social gatherings were still off limits. People were allowed to exercise, play sport or sit in the park but only with members of their own household. You could meet up with one other person in an outdoor public place - as long as the two metre social distancing rules was followed. Meeting up in private gardens was not allowed and dferent households could not mix indoors. On June , the rules changed to allow people to meet outside in groups of up to six people - but this was not allowed on the day of the No bash.Read More What were the Tories saying  Only  minutes before the party was due to begin, Tory Minister Oliver Dowden gave a press conference where he warned people not to meet up over the sunny weekend. He urged the public to “limit contact with other people”, and said: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. The Cabinet minister warned “staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.”Mr Dowden added: “If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus. “This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.” Five days after the No drinks, Boris Johnson said police should intervene to stop outdoor gatherings. He was asked by a member of the public at a press conference: “There are large groups gathering in local parks, ignoring social distancing rules. When many of us are being so vigilant and staying alert, what can be done to discourage this disregard for the rules ” The PM replied: “Feel free to speak to people yourselfyou feel that they are not obeying the rules. “But the police will step innecessary and encourage people to obey the law. What did the police say  On May , , the Met Police tweeted: Have you been enjoying the hottest day of the year so far It is important that we all continue to #StayAlert You can relax, have a picnic, exercise or play sport, as long as you are:- On your own - With people you live with - Just you and one other person Between  March and  May, , fines for lockdown breaches were issued across England and Wales, according to the National Police Chiefsapos Council.

With Omicron now known to be less severe than initially feared – and transmission very much spread across the whole of the UK – we should follow the example set by other countries across Europe and scrap testing altogether for the fully-vaccinated.

Energy bills are soaring. And working families are paying the price.A decade of incompetence, dither and delay on energy have got us here. Of course, there is a global gas price crisis. But Conservative failure to regulate, store gas, and make inroads on insulation, renewables and nuclear energy have left Britain uniquely exposed. Labour has a fully-funded plan to give families facing rising bills security now. Our plan would save most households around £ off their bills – with up to £ in total for those who need it most.That package includes a VAT cut on everyone’s home energy bills for a year from  to  percent. And it has extra help for the squeezed middle, those on lower incomes and pensioners, boosting the Warm Homes Discount and expanding it to  million households. We’d pay for this with a windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas profits –companies that have had a booming year. But we need to keep bills low in the future too. That’s why a Labour government will make us rely less on imported gas by speeding up home-grown renewables and nuclear. Our plan to make sure  million homes well-insulated will save households £ every year on their bills. And we’ll regulate the market better – pledging to never again let energy companies make promises they can’t keep. When it comes to the energy crisis - as with so much  - the Conservatives have been asleep at the wheel. Labour has a plan that would ease the crisis now. But a Labour government will create the secure energy supply we need for the future too.

Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove “hasn’t got the first clue” what his brief actually means, according to his shadow counterpart Lisa Nandy.Last month, the PM delayed his White Paper on levelling up yet again until early this year – and it has been further pushed back by Covid. Ms Nandy said: “The Government is under a lot of pressure to define what levelling up is after two years of empty slogans and broken promises. “But they still don’t know – and until they do know and they have a plan to deliver, it’s fairly clear the White Paper won’t be worth the paper it’s written on.”  The Wigan MP said Labour could win back voters’ trust by showing “we have a plan for every community in this country that matches the ambition of the people in it”. She added: “For me, this is a very personal mission. “It’s about bringing Labour home.” She believes well-paid, secure jobs are the key to levelling-up for parts of the country where young people have been forced to leave to find opportunities where. She hinted that Labour could back Silicon Valley-style tax breaks to help encourage private firms to invest. But first she said ministers should firstly be focusing on better transport, digital infrastructure and skills to make any such high-skilled jobs more accessible.  She said: “What use is that [private investment] to the child standing out in the playground looking out at some of those top jobs unless they know that they can get them  “Sometimes those jobs are two miles away, but they might as well be on the moon as far as those young people are concerned.” Ms Nandy says lasting change starts from the bottom up. She added: “It’s far harder for governments to dismantle things that are co-owned and run by local people. “But localism alone can’t solve these problems – it needs active national governments to come in and support them to deliver change.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Silicon Valley PLCMichael GoveBoris JohnsonPoliticsLisa Nandy MPLabour PartyDaily MirrorLevelling Up Watch\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tory MP Nigel Mills said: “I canapost see how anybody who organised a party or willingly chose to attend one can stay in any position where theyaposre setting Covid policy for the rest of the country. “If he knew it was a party and chose to attend, I’m not sure how he can hold a position in that situation.”Scots Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the PM should quithe was found to have misled Parliament by insisting no rules had been broken. He said: “If the Prime Minister has misled Parliament, then he must resign.” And Sir Charles Walker - vice chairman of the backbench  Committee which organises Tory leadership contests - gave the PM a six-month ultimatum. He told Channel  News: “I think the next six months will be very important for him.“Six months is a very long time in any prime ministeraposs le and you have just got to get a lot more decisions right than you get wrong. So it has to be very good six months and a good sht.  Tory MP Derek Thomas added: “If the inquiry or the politan Police find that the alleged activities were illegal and that the PM knew this, or was involved, then I think he should consider his position.” Weaposve had enough, another Tory MP told the Mirror. Heaposs tarred us all with the same brush. Former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Le Sir Alistair Graham told Times Radio: Itaposs dficult to see how the Prime Minister can survive this.It’s thought Mr Johnson could make a statement at the start of Wednesday’s PMQs after going into hiding today about whether he attended the party.Billionaire PhonesU founder John Caudwell, who donated £, to the Tories ahead of the  election, blasted the chaos-hit PM.He told the BBC : “Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone  sort it out so that the Tories arenapost wiped out at the next election. And a brutal Savanta ComRes poll found % of Brits said Mr Johnson should resign following the parties furore. Those calling for the PM to go included % of those who voted Tory in  - up nine points since last month. A second poll of , British adults by YouGov found % of respondents said the PM should resign. % said he should remain and % didnapost know. Bookies slashed the odds on the Prime Minister having to step down this year, with Paddy Power cutting theirs from   to  . Mr Caudwell said he had “never been puritanical about lockdown restrictions” but “the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking is impossible to justy”. The donor, who spoke out against sleaze and party allegations over Christmas, said the impact is “disastrous”. He added: “Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think itaposs aposone rule for them, one rule for the rest of us’.”  Keighley MP Robbie Moore said answers were needed quickly and thatany rule breaches had taken place the strongest possible disciplinary action should be taken. He added: “The email from Martin Reynolds infuriates me. I have no idea what these people were thinking.” Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said the allegations were impossible to justy and defend. He added: “For some of the people who imposed those damaging laws to have been ignoring them will be a bitter pill to swallow for those who faithfully followed them even at huge personal cost.” Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve claimed the PM was a serial liar who should be ousted from office. Sunderland Tory leader Councillor Antony Mullen said Mr Reynolds should be sacked and the PM would inevitably have to follow him out the door. I think this is such an atrocity, I canapost see how he can survive, he added.  In response to a tweet from a constituent, whose we works in a hospital, about the scandal, Tory MP Johnny Mercer said: I’m sorry. It’s humiliating, and does not reflect the majority of my colleagues who *at least try* and lead by example. Thank you for your sacrice and your we’s work. I will always represent you above all . Tory MP Bob Blackman said: “People are rightly furious...I am clear that those who set the rules must abide by them or face the consequences.” Tory MP Caroline Nokes said: “I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the “don’t do as I do , do as I say” attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street.” Conservative former minister Sir Christopher Chope asked: Why canapost all the dirty linen be washed at once  Why are we getting this drip, drip feed of parties  Surely the civil service must have known that there was a party on May  and they should have referred it already to the inquiry.The Prime Minister ducked a Commons appearance which saw tearful and angry MPs recount painful lockdown memories.  After the Mirror first revealed five weeks ago that lockdown-breaking parties had taken place, he told MPs that “all guidance was followed completely in No”. It follows the emergence of a bombshell email showing a senior aide to the PM inviting more than  No  employees to an evening gathering on May  . The party means Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray is now probing at least six events, four of which were attended by the PM, with her report expected to be published next week. The Met Police is in contact with the Cabinet Office about the claims although no formal investigation has been launched. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for Scotland Yard to look into the explosive partyThe Good Law Project has issued formal legal proceedings against the Met for their failure to investigate last yearaposs Christmas parties.In the email, leaked to ITV News on Monday, the PMaposs principal private secretary Martin Reynolds said staff should make the most of the lovely weatherand urged them to bring your own booze.Witnesses claimed about  staff attended the event, including Mr Johnson and his we Carrie - and there were long tables laden with drink, crisps, sausage rolls and other picnic food. Outdoor gatherings were banned at the time under Englandaposs tough lockdown laws. No  said the PM was standing by Mr Reynolds - and refused to confirm whether the PM had been at the bash while Ms Grayaposs inquiry is ongoing. Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the PM of hiding behind the Whitehall investigation. His absence speaks volumes. The public have already drawn their own conclusions, she said. There is no need for an investigation into the simple, central question today. Did the Prime Minister attend the event in the Downing Street garden on  May   It won’t wash to blame this on a few junior civil servants. The Prime Minister sets the tone. In the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Johnson should resign, claiming he was not being truthful about his knowledge of the ious parties. Responding to opposition calls for Mr Johnson to resign in the Commons, minister Michael Ellis told MPs the Prime Minister was going nowhere, adding that he retains the confidence of the people of this country and he did so two years ago with the biggest majority in decades. Health Minister Edward Argar told the BBC: I can entirely understand why people whoaposve lost loved ones, or people whoaposve just had their lives hugely disrupted by these restrictions, are angry and upset by these allegations.Hannah Brady, of the campaign group Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, whose fatheraposs death certicate was signed on the day of the socially distanced drinks, wrote to the Prime Minister calling for him to say whether he attended the event.She said: It is a matter of common decency and respect for not only us or the British people, but the office you hold as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to tell us whether you attended this flagrant breach of the Governmentaposs own rules.

She says: “Hunger is something that should not be going on in England. “Many years that I have gone without - you could see the bones jutting out of my chest because I had three children and it’s me they’re relying on. “I remember things being really bad, to the point where at times I ate dog food.” Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter She recalls how she discovered that getting a job would mean being stripped of other benefits. “Things that you were once entitled to, now you’re no longer entitled to those things, then you realise you’re working and still in poverty,” Tfanie tells the film. “In my opinion the system is broken, it doesn’t seem to reflect the needs of the modern family.”Another contributor to the YouTube film, ‘No Child Too Hungry to Learn’, tells how household bills swallow up money.“For the people that earn just enough not to get any help, I think that section of people struggle a lot,” says community nurse Claire. “All their income goes on bills and rent, and then there’s nothing left over.  “It’s hard with the children. I have had sleepless nights thinking about whether I’m going to have enough for the shopping. “That’s a terrible thing to worry about - how you’re going to feed your baby.” The video was made “to raise awareness of the realities faced by families experiencing hunger across the UK”, according to Magic Breakfast. A study published alongside the film shows eight out of  schools believe hunger among their pupils climbed in the past year. Nine out of  schools also think poverty leapt, according to the Magic Breakfast Measuring and Monitoring Survey  . Charity chief Lindsey Macdonald said: “The scale of poverty and hunger in the UK is at a critical level.  “It has a devastating impact on the children who start each day without any food to wake up to. “Our research highlights the increase in poverty and child hunger in our school communities in the past year, and the ripple effect this can have on children and their ability to learn.” Director Ally Green, working with AllMedia’s Bullion Productions, said: “I hope the audience will connect to the families and children at the heart of this film, and are left with a deeper understanding of the social, economic and iable factors that all play into child poverty, with an unrivalled feeling of being compelled to create change.” AllMedia’s chief operating officer Sara Geater said: “It is a sobering yet hopeful film and highlights the urgent need for proper nutrition for all children.” A Government spokesman said: “No child should go hungry - that’s why we have provided a £million Household Support Fund on top of £m to support schools in disadvantaged areas to provide breakfasts to those who need it, with our Holiday Activities and Food programme providing healthy food and enriching activities to disadvantaged children. “We are providing extensive support to help those on the lowest incomes - including putting an average of £, more per year into the pockets of working families on Universal Credit, increasing the minimum wage by .% and helping with the cost of fuel bills.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsChild PovertyChild Poverty CampaignFood banksPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

No tousling of the blond barnet, no words of Greek or absurd chat about Peppa Pig or even starting World War Three will get the great charlatan off the giant hook heaposs impaled on.Because heaposs discovered the hard way that an unprincipled politician can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but they canapost fool all of the people all of the time. And voters taken for fools want revenge, a head on a silver platter, when they realise there were taken for fools... and the head they want is Johnsonaposs. Hiding the truth about parties then trying to hide behind Sue Grayaposs inquiry is both self-destructive and cowardly.Self-destructive when lies and cover-ups ignore the old advice to stop digging when in a hole.Had Johnson half-admitted and apologised for partying when the first bashes were revealed last month, the controversy might, just might, be over. Accepting short-term pain produces long-term gain. Instead heaposs buried himself by leaping into the cab of a JCB and enlarging that hole into a cavern swallowing him up. And cowardly when Johnson frantically twists, contorts and deceives to avoid uncomfortable truths. There arenapost enough hours in the day for him to apologise personally to everybody who couldnapost say goodbye to a loved one or attend a funeral to follow the rules the ruler imposed then ignored.Angry Conservative MPs on the end of hostility from voters know the only way to staunch the party charges is to axe the host, an election-winning leader in  transformed into a liability in  and probably  and .Attempting to legitimise sleaze, defending Owen Paterson, followed by the mishandling of responses to endless parties illustrate the poor judgement of a Johnson who always acted asrules were for little folk inferior to him.Those MPs fear in the Year of the Squeeze, tax rises and soaring energy prices consuming living standards, the British electorate will not forget or forgive the carouser-in-chiefaposs partying and lies.Demanding sacrices from the public then running Whitehall as party central will be Johnsonaposs undoing.He deserves to be kicked out of the saloon for , Covid deaths, a disastrous Brexit or  other crimes.And what a delicious irony his old mucker Dominic Cummings, a Brexit co-conspirator, is orchestrating the campaign to topple him. When heaposs crying into his beer, Johnson will still be blaming everybody . Infamy! Infamy! Theyaposve all got it in for me! Lies have a habit of catching up with liars. Johnson has nobody left to lie to when an entire nation recognises heaposs incapable of telling the truth.

Just one Tory MP - Anne-Marie Morris - backed the non-binding motion for a debate on the issue meaning it was defeated by  votes to , majority .Yet more than two dozen Tory MPs have in recent years pledged to scrap the tax off home energy bills, including Boris Johnson himself. Treasury minister Simon Clarke said the Government recognises the pressure Brits are facing and would look closely at all options available.The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are, however, understood to be in talks to cut the VAT on energy bills to lessen the blow once the price cap rises on April . Mr Johnson has previously described the proposal as a blunt instrument and is likely to settle on a mixture of measures to help consumers.It comes after Britain’s third-largest energy supplier Ovo Energy was forced to apologise for advising households to cuddle pets, eat porridge and do star jumps to keep warm.Scroll down for the full list of  Tories who previously backed a VAT cut Labour wants to impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £.Fossil fuel giants would be forced to contribute £.bn to help fund the proposals, through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of %. The £.bn plan would also include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount to . million people. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: The Prime Minister seems to think that the cost of living crisis is when you canapost find a friend to pay for the luxury refurbishment of your flat. But for working people in our country, a cost of living crisis means struggling to pay your gas and electricity bills. Mr Clarke said: No-one in this Government is under any illusion about the challenges families are facing with their household finances and we will of course continue to look closely at all the options that exist.

Alexandra Sinyavskaya, , met Antonio Scuzzarella, , back in  when she was working part time at a coffee shop in Turin while studying. While Alexandra worked shts, Antonio would stop in for coffee as his office was just around the corner. After showering her with compliments, Antonio eventually won her heart and the pair began to date. However, two months later, they amicably separated when Alexandra decided she wasnapost mature enough to be in a serious relationship. She finished her studies to qualy as an accountant and moved back to her hometown of Moscow, Russia - but the pair remained friends over the years. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But in February , shortly before the pandemic started, they found themselves in touch more often and reconnected online. Before long, theyaposd booked a trip to Barcelona together. Alexandra said: In February , we made plans to go to Spain together as friends as he knew the country very well and I have always wanted to go. We bought tickets and made plans for a holiday in Barcelona when Covid hit and Italy closed its borders. He insisted that I should go without him, but I said no and we stayed at home, him in Turin, Italy and me in Prague, Czech Republic. During lockdown, the pair spoke every single day and kept each other up to date with what they were doing. By September , Alexandra had moved to Turin to live with her beau. While living with Antonio, Alexandra fell pregnant - but tragically she lost the baby at five weeks.  It made us realise that we want to be together, get married and start a family, she said. In February , she found out she was pregnant again - but tragedy struck once more when Alexandra miscarried at seven weeks. After a tough few months in which Antonio proposed but Alexandra did not accept, the pair finally got engaged when she was ready in June  and the pair tied the knot in December. Although the couple are smitten with each other, Alexandra says they do get some unusual looks and comments from people who judge their -year age gap. People assume that I am with him for his money and sayhe was a simple clerk or a street sweeper I would not be with him, the accountant said.  She added it took time for Antonioaposs friends to understand sheaposs with him for love, and not because she wanted his money or a to live in Italy. Some of my friends still donapost understand why Iaposm not with a better-looking guy my age, she said. Sometimes when we are out in the streets people ask whether he is my dad and we have to clary that we are a couple. It is funny, but it also gets very annoying after a while. Alexandra is no stranger to age gap relationships, having dated a -year-old man when she was just , and being with a man  years older than her when she met Antonio. I discovered very early on in my dating le that I donapost like the system, she said. I want you to show me something that I donapost know. I prefer a man who knows how to live, I want a man who is experienced, who is well-travelled and knows who he is. She said most people judge age gap relationships because theyaposre not educated about them. Anything out of the norm is unacceptable, she said.

They found the remains of an ancient church at the site of St Maryaposs Church, Stoke Mandeville, Bucks. The team were excavating a site which is located along the HS railway route when they made the astonishing discovery. The Norman church dates back to  and the remains found are thought to have once been an Anglo-Saxon church. Beneath the church, flint walls were found that are organised into a square structure. There has been a team of over  archaeologists working to unveil the Anglo-Saxon church since September.  The Church of St Mary’s was built around  in a damp, isolated spot around half a mile from the village during the Norman conquest. It was eventually demolished after it was neglected and fell into ruin, and a new more, convenient church was built in the th Century. Amazingly, after almost , years after it was built, the government’s HS railway line now needs to pass through the ruin.  Roman roof tiles have been found in the foundations of the ancient building, and it is thought that a Roman settlement existed near the church. This means that some materials from the settlement could have been used in the building of the church. And a team of archaeologists are excavating thousands of graves while preserving thousands more artefacts.Dr Rachel Wood, the site’s lead archaeologist, spoke during a recent BBC documentary called aposDigging for Britainapos and tells of how her team are to find out why there was a church in the middle of a field. Archaeologist Guy Hunt told the documentary: “Those sculptures, that is so rare. To find that sort of thing in an archaeological context, it’s really, really rare.” Dr Wood added: “You would be extremely luckyyou ever found anything like that, let alone more than one of them.” The site made headlines in September, and during recent excavations, the team unearthed evidence of Iron Age, Bronze Age and even Roman activity.  However, there is a gap of more than  years, before they were able to find evidence of an Anglo-Saxon church buried beneath. Archaeologists also found flint walls, and flint foundations that were around one metre wide. At the time, Dr Wood explained: “To have so much of it remaining, including the walls and even some flooring, will provide a great deal of information about the site prior to the construction of the Norman church in  AD.  “The discovery of this pre-Norman, possible Saxon Church is a once in a career opportunity for archaeologists and will provide a much greater understanding of the history of Stoke Mandeville.” Last year, , medieval graves had to be moved from the church as part of HS planning. They were moved to a new site and an official monument was built. The discovery of the ruins has been deemed a fantastic discovery.

The -year-old, who has more than  inkings, including several on her face, is known by many as the girl with the tattoos. She told the Daily Star: “I can’t express enough how much my tattoos are a part of my le. I live in such a small town and everyone knows me just from my appearance. They donapost know my name, it’s just the girl with the tattoos. Despite inkings being such a big part of her identity, Aimee agreed to get them covered up for an experiment.  Aimee, from Oakham, East Mids, said: “I was not impressed. I was trying so hard not to cry. “To some people, itaposs just being covered in makeup but I was disgusted seeing myself looking like that. “I know itaposs a strong word but I felt vile and horrible in myself. I felt so uncomfortable and it was like looking at someone who I didnapost know.” The mum-of-two added: “It takes a lot for my mum to cry. I was shocked to hear her say how beautul I looked but at the same time because I’ve had face tattoos for so long and they are such a big part of my le she was like, ‘that’s not my daughter’.” Alternative model Aimee got her first face tattoo aged  and took part in the recent transformation for an episode of Hooked on the Look. She decided to do it after trolls had told her she had “ruined” her face and that a parent having so many was “unacceptable”. Aimee also wanted to remember what she used to look like before the ink – but the makeover just made her appreciate her unique style even more.  She said: “Since doing that programme it was like, ‘wow I really am so comfortable with who I am’. After the camera people left I was like I really need to get in the shower. I had to pick my kids up and my youngest wouldnapost even look at me because he had no idea who I was. Their reaction made me realise just how much my tattoos are a part of me. She added: “I have since gone on to do things I wouldnapost have had the courage to do - last week I was even invited to a local primary school to teach children about tattoos. “There were times I’ve felt like a caged animal because of my tattoos but now I am just proud of who I am and don’t care what others think.” Aimee began to be fascinated with tattoos when she watched shows like Miami Ink as a little girl. She then adopted an alternative style aged  - something she describes as never having grown out of. Shortly after turning , she got her first tattoo and the model is now a mum to boys Elijah, six, and Remy, one.

She explained: To me, the words symbolise wanting to work as hard as I possibly can and to do everything I possibly can for my kids. The years her children were born are also inked to her knuckles. Aimee was given her own tattoo machine aged  and she soon tatted an elephant to her ankle in tribute to her stepdad. She has also experimented on other parts of her legs and the mum is now planning to get her whole body covered in ink and she said her artwork will always be a huge part of her identity.

Alcohol consumption in the UK in  was at an all-time high, and according to experts more people are took part in Dry January than ever before. GP Dr Ross Perry, Medical Director of cosmedics, told how after just one week off the booze youaposll notice a change in your food choices and appetite, and feel more energetic. After a month off, sleep will be fully regulated, skin will be clearer and the fat around the liver could have reduced by as much as  per cent.Meanwhile, wellbeing expert andBBCRadio  DJ Janey Lee Grace revealed what itaposs really like during the first month without alcohol, after she quit drinking all together.Dr Perry told Mail Online: Binge drinking can have serious health problems. In the long term it can boost the risk for liver disease, high blood pressure, stroke, certain cancers, and heart disease but equally it can cause accidents alongside memory problems, alcohol poisoning and a build-up of alcohol in the blood stream which can affect our vital organs.Having the odd alcoholic drink every now and then isnapost going to cause much of a problem but when moderation is every day, and at least several glasses, this is when long term it can cause a problem.apos He added: After your last drink the liver starts working overtime and the pancreas starts producing extra insulin. Itaposs important to drink lots of water over the coming days to keep your skin and body hydrated.  What happens to your body when you stop drinking  Week oneThe first few days following no alcohol your body goes into detox mode. Headaches and grogginess will have subsided and you start to feel more refreshed in general, but it actually takes up to  hours before you mentally and physically feel back to normal.Your sleep pattern becomes more regulated after - days meaning youaposll wake up with more energy and skin looks clearer. This is because drinking alcohol may send us to sleep very quickly but in actual fact we miss out on the all important Rapid Eye movement which should be around - cycles. But the effects of alcohol mean this is limited to one or two.  In the first week youaposll notice a change in your food choices and appetite. When weaposve been drinking alcohol the hormone that makes you feel hungry go up which often leads to bingeing on the wrong foods. Eating a better diet will make us feel better overall, not forgetting all those calories weaposre likely to save, approximately  calories over daysyou were drinking a glass of wine each night. Waking up with a flatter tummy in the first week instead of feeling bloated and lethargic will also be visible in the first week. Week two After two weeks you will notice a huge improvement in overall sleep pattern as your body becomes more regulated. Better brainfollowing a good nightaposs sleep and replacing water instead of alcohol will also have a huge benefit to our skin which will appear clearer, less dry looking and fine lines reduced. After two weeks you will also likely see a drop in body weight, eye bags reduced and far less overall bloating around the stomach area. Week three After three weeks blood pressure will reduce. Drinking every day and binge drinking can cause our blood pressure to rise and can be really dangerous. Reducing blood pressure can help with any long-term health problems. After three weeks you will also notice a signicant improvement in overall cognitive ability and increased energy levels. Week four After four weeks of not drinking alcohol skin and eyes will look brighter and clearer. Skin which is irritated and normally dry will feel better due to the added hydration to the body. After four weeks, liver fat reduces up to  per cent, increasing its ability to flush out toxins. Mild liver disease, like fatty liver can be reversed completelya person stops drinking alcohol altogether. When there is no alcohol in your blood for several months, the liver cells canto normal. Overall after four weeks of not drinking alcohol, sleep will be regulated and you will most certainly feel well rested. More energy, clearer skin, less bloated and likely to have dropped a dress size. Brainand productivity will have increased and youaposll generally feel better overall in yourself.  Tips on reducing your alcohol intake when you start drinking again GP Dr Ross Perry shares his top tips on reducing your overall booze intake - Keep a diary - The key to reducing your alcohol intake is first to keep a diary of how much alcohol youaposre actually consuming. Many of us may not realise the levels of booze weaposre actually consuming, especially being in lockdown.Plan ahead - Look to have alcohol free days,you drink every day start by drinking every other, and slowly reduce this down, first to every few days, then perhaps just a weekends.Itaposs important though not to binge on the days you do allow yourself to drink which will do more harm than good. Try to have a glass of water before you have alcohol and alternate alcoholic drinks with water or other non-alcoholic drinks. Form a habit - Replace the time you drink alcohol with doing some exercise, taking a long bath or make yourself a mocktail. Your head and body will thank you for it the next day.Save money - Be mindful about how you shop for alcohol and what youaposre actually purchasing. Put the money aside youaposd normally spend on alcohol and create a apostreat boxapos for something you really want to buy.Ease yourself into it - If you havenapost drunk alcohol for a while start by having a glass of water. Keep measures small so opt for a small glass of wine, or a bottle of beer rather than a pint and alternative with water and soft drinks to keep hydrated.Donapost fall back into the habit of drinking every day but keep it in moderation as it will be more enjoyable when you do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Keep a diary of your alcohol intake so you can stay on track. The author, who penned Happy Healthy Sober - Ditch the booze and take control of your le, now works to help others ditch booze through Emotional Freedom Techniquestherapy. She explained that for a someone who drinks heavily and often, but is not clinically dependent on alcohol, cravings are mental rather than physical. She said: When you first stop drinking its a shock to the system for sure. In truth,you are a aposingapos drinker , then the alcohol will have left the body within a few days, so any cravings are not physical but mental, but they can be VERY strong. The big problem is the brain chemistry is out of whack, so we want a hit of dopamine, or serotonin and can literally feel like climbing the walls to get some relief from the voice in our head telling us... go on, just have one! Sharing lessons she has learned from her own sobriety, she advised making sure to stock up on healthy serotonin boosting foods and substituting booze with an alcohol-free alternative, so you donapost lose the sense of aposglamourapos drinking brings. She said: What does help, I now know, is to do your preparation, stock up on really good healthy food and snacks, you need good proteins and fats to balance those brain chemicals.Will you be giving Dry January a go  Join the debate in our comments below Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCBlood pressureHeart diseaseMental healthSave moneyAlcoholTherapyBinge drinkingFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The chalkboard sign, placed outside W.M Christie Butchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, called on locals to end violence against plants by eating meat. Vegans took offence to the message after a photo of the message circulated on social media. It read: “Every day thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians. Help end the violence and eat meat.”Some branded it nonsense while others went as far as calling the owners psychopaths, reports Edinburgh Live. Jakub Dragon, who shared the image on Facebook, told the publication: “I just think it’s nonsense, I don’t understand.How can they justy killing an animal like that  It only brings anger and fights and I don’t find that funny.Surely eating plants is less damaging to the environment and plants, unlike animals, are not sentient. Many were outraged by the tongue-in-cheek sign mocking vegan diets. Kevin Thomson commented: Jeez, the ignorance is astonishing. Plants are not sentient and exist in synergy with humans and animals as a food source. You just canapost say I murdered a carrot. People will cling to all sorts of nonsense to justy murdering animals. Animals that have exactly the same fundamental wishes as us - to be happy, safe and free from suffering. Adam Rennie said: SoI interpreted that right, we need to eat the humans because it was humans that killed the plants too ” Lisa Roy added: And what does their meat eat  Others interpreted the sign as a joke and said there was no need to get upset. Gilly Billy said: Surely we can take this in good humour. These people are running a business that has been in their family for generations. It doesn’t mean we all have to eat meat. It can’t be okay for vegans to fly the vegan flag, and not okay for meat-eaters to do the same. Regardless of our reasons behind being vegan.

We are surrounded by people telling us to go vegan and vegetarian, yet my business is a butcheraposs. We sell meat and I’m promoting my business. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that, I’m just expressing mine. And it seems to have worked, given the attention my butchers has now received.

Marie Irene Carol Scottaposs oldest son, Stuart, and her husband, James, had asked consultants, police officers, and ambulance technicians to detain the -year-old under the Mental Health Act, coroner Adrian Farrow heard at the opening day of the week long inquest. They made the pleas after she had attempted to take her own le three times, South Manchester coroneraposs court heard.The mum from Hale disappeared on December , , the Manchester Evening News reports. Her leg was later found in the River Irwell in Salford some  months later, with her remains tragically discovered in the Mersey Marsh, near Frodsham, in December .  James says Marie first attempted to take her le on December , , after being found at home, but had been discharged just  hours later, with doctors allegedly saying she was aposjust being sillyapos. I could not believe she was being discharged, James said in court. She tried to take her own le yesterday. The psychiatrist said he thought she was just being silly. Marieaposs mental health began to deteriorate at the end of October  following the passing of her mum, Irene, who would visit her daughter aposfour or five timesapos a week. It did not initially affect her, said James, who was married to his childhood sweetheart for  years. But it had [an impact] in her own mind. The first signs that Marie was not well came a few days after the loss of Irene, after her husband discovered her when it aposwas apparent she had been drinkingapos on a Saturday morning - which was very out of character, he added. Then, on November , the self-employed ironing businesswoman rang eldest son Stuart to ask for apossleeping tabletsapos and aposanti-anxiety medicationapos. That led her to seeing her GP, Dr Patel, who prescribed her anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. However, her out-of-character behaviour continued.  On December , instead of seeing her brother and sister-in-law for coffee as she did most weekends, Marie did not arrive at their home - and instead ed back to her house after aposdrinkingapos. When dad James came back after looking in the shops for her, she was aposfast asleepapos on the settee - but he became alarmed when she had not stirred for apossix hoursapos. That prompted the family to call for an ambulance, who took her to Wythenshawe Hospital. She was very drowsy and non-responsive, Stuart explained. During the visit, paramedics were aposspeaking to her but she was not talking back, she was completely out of itapos, James added. Despite her admittance and overnight stay at Wythenshawe Hospital, the family felt more could have been done to care for Marie. I went on December  thinking I was going to visit, James continued during his testimony in the court. They said she had been declared medically fit and she was in with a psychiatrist. I could not believe she was being discharged. She tried to take her own le yesterday. The psychiatrist said he thought she was just being silly. When asked why the family thought doctors felt she was fit to leave their care, they said it was because Marie was a good aposactressapos.  The next time Marieaposs actions raised the alarm was on December . After James had been working away for the morning, he ed to find Marie had vanished from home. That sparked a search effort from the family across Hale and other places they knew the mother was likely to know. Eventually, Marie was found by a dog walker in a pond in Sunbank Wood, in Hale, with cuts to her wrists and legs. Again, she was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she stayed until December . During her stay, the family again asked the doctors to section his mum. I would always ask the nursethey were going to let her out, Stuart said. They said aposnot a chanceapos. They had a security guard at the end of the bed. James added: I expressed how serious this was. I said the family want her sectioned and that she needs to be on long-term medication. The doctor said she does not need that. He said she would be better served by the home team. I said this has all happened within five days from being released to a far more serious attempt. Stuart, giving evidence alongside his dad, said the news of his mumaposs discharge took a heavy toll on him. It destroyed me, he said. She stabbed herself and nearly drowned. What more warning signs do you need  Although home visits were arranged for Marie, only two appointments took place before her final out-of-character incident. After Stuartaposs partner Roxanne had stayed with her at the family home on December , Marie dashed out the door - with Roxanne following her. After she could not find her on foot, Roxanne turned to see Marie driving a car. Eventually, Roxanne managed to get Marie out of the car and call the police. When Stuart arrived at the scene, he asked the attending police officer: Please section my mum. We were banging our heads against a brick wall. We asked three of four times. We were really scared. For a third time, Marie was not sectioned, and instead saw another psychiatrist the following day. After both Marie and James arrived back from the appointment, at around .am, he went out to run some errands, and left Marie to start work. Tragically, that would be the final time he saw his we alive. The inquest then heard that Marie left home in the early afternoon, boarding a bus to Altrincham station, where she took a tram to Deansgate. She then proceeded to walk around the Bridgewater Canal area of the city for some time, before buying some items, including alcohol, from a Sainsburyaposs store. After this, she boarded another tram to Victoria Station, and then asked a taxi driver to take to Heaton Park and then The Rock shopping centre in Bury. Police Senior Investigating Officer DI Simon Aker then said Marie was last spotted on CCTV walking towards Openshaw Park, at around :pm - roughly the same time the family alerted the police to her disappearance. That was the last confirmed sighting or Marie, with pathologists believing that the most likely cause of death was a sudden movement of the head towards the chest, breaking her neck. The inquest continues, with a verdict expected on Friday.* Samaritansoperates a -hour service available every day of the year.

She was assured there would beRiver Carver and Tommys dad Connor Brotherton with the coffin Image: River Carver   SWNSByAmy Reast:,  Jan | commentsA funeral home has apologised after a mum who went to collect her baby sonaposs ashes was handed an empty tube.River Carver miscarried her first baby, Tommy, at  weeks, and opted to have a ceremony to remember him.She asked Co-op Funeralcarethere would be any ashes to take homeshe opted to have him cremated, due to his tiny size. River had decided she would have him buriedthere were not any ashes - instead, she claims Co-op promised there would be ashes.The cremation then went ahead a month after Tommyaposs death, on June , . But, when -year-old River went to collect the ashes, she was told there were none, after all, thanks to a heartbreaking mix-up.The devastated mum-of-two, from Morley, Leeds, filed a formal complaint last year but said she is still brought to tears by the blunder. River said: I knew from the start that I only wanted Tommy to be crematedthere would be ashes. I was told there definitely would be - until I turned up to collect the ashes from the hospital and there were none. I was heartbroken - I wanted to bring some of him home so he could be here with us. Even now, thinking about it brings me to tears. A scan had shown Tommy no longer had a heartbeat in June . The young mum had to give birth to her stillborn son at St James Hospital, Leeds, on June . Devastated River was given the option to hold a funeral for tiny Tommy the following month, which was to be organised by Co-op Funeralcare. She said in a consultation about the funeral, which took place on July , she was asked whether she wished to have her tiny son cremated or buried. River said: I wanted to be able to take him home, so I said I only wanted to have him crematedthere would be ashes. I was worried there might not be as he was only tiny - so I told them I didnapost want to end up with nothing left of him. I said I would rather have him buriedthere wouldnapost be ashes, but the funeral team said there definitely would be.  Following the funeral, Tommyaposs minuscule remains were cremated at Cottingley Hall Crematorium. But when the grieving mother went to collect Tommyaposs ashes, she was horried to learn there were no ashes for her to collect. Sadly, the scatter tube Co-op sent the hospital - which was supposed to have contained the ashes - was empty. River said: I was heartbroken - I rang my sister and broke down on the phone. Despite her devastation, River spent the next three years trying to come to terms with the loss of her first child. She went on to have Tommyaposs younger siblings Bobbylee, three, and Elisha, two, but has never forgotten her first son. After a conversation with family in the summer of , River was convinced to submit a formal complaint to the Co-op. And, after an internal investigation took place, the company acknowledged its errors and apologised. A letter to River sent in September  said: At the time of Tommyaposs sad death, staff from Co-op Funeralcare should have made the Bereavement Services team aware that due to Tommyaposs young age, there may not be any ashes to collect following cremation.  It explained that due to a breakdown in communication, the young mum was then given an empty scatter tube. It later read: We are so very sorry for the upset these failures in communication have caused. As compensation, Co-op agreed to foot the bill for a memorial area in Riveraposs garden, dedicated to Tommy, which she said was installed four months ago costing £,. The memorial features a headstone, bench, a series of ornaments and a gate where the mum-of-two says she now sits every evening to think about him. She said she brings Bobbylee and Elisha with her to the memorial, to talk about their older brother who they tragically never got to meet. River said: While the memorial is lovely, itaposs not quite the same. Nothing will bring him back and I know because I couldnapost bring his ashes home, that heaposs not here with me. This mess-up means I donapost have my son here.

There have been several occasions where she has seemed to act as a peacemaker in a bid to ease family tensions. And it appears that sometimes her subtle interventions have paid off, while other times, they havenapost...Prince William and Prince Harry at Prince Philipaposs funeral One of the most tense relationships within the Royal Family is that of Williamaposs with his younger brother Prince Harry.The brotheraposs frosty relationship was reportedly sparked by Williamaposs concerns over Harryaposs fast-developing romance with Meghan Markle ahead of their royal wedding in . The tense row quickly boiled over - with Harry claiming his brother was trapped within the royal system during a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.Since leaving the UK in early  and stepping down as a senior royal, Harry has only seen his brother twice - and one of these times was at the funeral of Prince Philip.

On that day, all eyes were on feuding brothers, who were reunited for the first time in more than a year after the younger brotheraposs interview. After the service at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor, the royals walked back to Windsor Castle on foot. Kate, William and Harry were seen chatting as they left St Georgeaposs Chapel - before Kate quietly dropped behind allowing the brothers to talk. Speaking at the time, Brian Hoey, who has written a biography of Prince William, told The Sun: “They say cometh the hour, cometh the man. But in the Royal Familyaposs case, it’s a woman.“Thank God for Kate — she is the rock the monarchy will depend on. On Saturday, she behaved absolutely impeccably.” Statue unveiling  Despite Kateaposs best efforts at Philipaposs funeral, it appears that William and Harryaposs rt was still ongoing last July.Then the brothers came together and put on a united front for a poignant ceremony to unveil a beautul statue of their late mother Princess Diana.According to friends, after the Oprah interview, William was left feeling very upset and reeling over the claims made in it by Harry, with his head all over the place. And a source told the Sunday Timesthat he was still furious several months later and didnapost want to attend the Diana statue unveiling with his brother, who jetted in from Calornia for the event.The close friend said: William was still furious. He had taken the view that he’d only give so much. He just didn’t want to go there [with Harry].” However, the newspaper credits Kate, who did not appear at the event, as working her magic out of sight as a peacekeeper. And in the end, the unveiling did go ahead smoothly and without a hitch with both brothers present. An aide said: [Catherine] was amazing behind the scenes when Harry came.” Olive branch Meanwhile, before Harry and Meghanaposs departure from the UK, Kate is said to have advised Harry to offer William an “olive branch” meeting in a bid to repair their fractured relationship.At Easter , Kate tried to repair “a complete and utter breakdown of communication” between the brothers. Her advice led to Harry and Meghan inviting them to their then new home at Windsor after they attended church on Easter Sunday.They had tea and chatted for around  minutes at Frogmore Cottage.At the time, a palace source told the Mirror: “The Duchess and Harry have developed a very close bond over the years. “Kate is acutely aware of the importance of William and Harry getting along, not just because of perception but their collective responsibility to the monarchy as a whole. Charlesapos th birthday  Despite her best efforts, Kate might not have had much success in healing the gulf between William and Harry. But one relationship that seems to have bloomed after her intervention is that of William with his father Prince Charles. In , both William and Harry appeared in a documentary to mark the th anniversary of the death of Diana, where no mention was made of Charles.And according to the Daily Mail, Charles was upset by this, with an insider telling royal expert Robert Jobson: It would have been nicethey had acknowledged his contribution to their upbringing. He was, and tries to be, a jolly good father after all.According to reports, it was Williamaposs we Kate herself who helped to smooth things over between her husband and father-in-law.And she did this by reportedly helping to organise a family portrait for Charles for his th birthday in . According to the Daily Mail, Kate was instrumental in making the portrait happen, which sees Prince George and Princess Charlotte beaming and cosying up to both Charles and his we Camilla. Grandfather Charles  Charles is a grandfather to Kate and Williamaposs three children - George, Charlotte and Louis.But in , it was reported by the Daily Mail that Charles had become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he felt he played in the le of eldest grandson Prince George.And several years later, William spoke in a documentary to mark his fatheraposs th birthday, where he revealed his wish for his children to spend more time with their granddad. He said: “I would like him to have more time with the children… to, you know, play around with the grandchildren. When heaposs there, heaposs brilliant, but we need him there as much as possible.” But Kate helped smooth relations when she is said to have persuaded Charles to visit their home Amner Hall in the summer of  and took on the logistical challenge of getting her family back home from a holiday on the Isles of Scilly to coincide with his visit. In doing so, it was reported that the heir to the throne was able to give his grandson George a seventh birthday present in person.

Arron Davies, , would start his day with a can of coke for breakfast before having a cheeseburger for lunch and then gorging in his bedroom until dinner.Fearing he would be disowned, he finally plucked up the courage and came out to his family who to his joy reacted with love and support, reported Wales Online.As a result he found the confidence to try and lose weight and has lost  stone in about three years. Teaching assistant Aaron said: “My confidence was so low that I didnapost feel like walking out the door sometimes because I thought other people were judging me. “I would then go to college and my typical lunch would be a burger or whatever was in the canteen. Then at tea I would eat unhealthy, processed food cooked in oil, like chips. “Iaposd feared being disowned but my mum said that she was really proud of me and loved me for who I am. “It was a huge weight lted off my shoulders and I finally felt like I could be myself. Aaron, from Ely, Cardf, joined his local Slimming World where he lost lbs in the first week and nine stone in a year. He now weighs in at st lbs and aims to reach st.  He added: “Picking up the basics was a bit of a struggle to begin with but once Iaposd wrapped my head around the Slimming World plan then I started to notice the weight loss, he said. Seeing the weight loss then really motivated me to keep on going. Using low-fat cooking spray, taking the skin off chicken, taking the fat off meat – these simple things have made a big dference. Iaposve switched from having that full fat Coke to a piece of fruit for breakfast. Then around lunchtime Iaposd typically eat a jacket potato with beans and then tea time would be a Slimming World chicken tikka masala. Before I lost the weight I felt like I was surviving – but now Iaposm living.

Fiona Leary, , ordered a box of Graze Protein Oat Boost bars online last Wednesday for her gym-loving family. But when she and her husband Justin opened the parcel, she claims one of the snacks had already been eaten. The business owner then said she made the stomach-churning discovery of an open wrapper poking out covered in tiny teeth marks and mouse droppings. When Justin, , complained to Amazon, Fiona said they were simply offered a replacement for the £. order without promising to investigate how it happened. The mum-of-three is now calling on Amazon to investigate a potential warehouse issue she believes caused the aposrevoltingapos delivery. Amazon said they are now investigating the issue and working with the customer to make things right. Fiona, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: It was disgusting. You can see the packet and itaposs got chewed teeth marks around it. There are black drops that look like mouse droppings and bits of the oat biscuit scattered around. Itaposs definitely an animal thataposs eaten it. Itaposs got tiny teeth marks and there are mouse droppings on it. You can see on the box and the wrapper. You can see droppings and pieces of oat.  Fiona told how one box was not touched but the other two had been and that there were black marks all around where some kind of vermin has been on top. She added: My husband ordered and spoke to Amazon online. They said aposalright, weaposll just replace the boxapos.They didnapost want photographs of it and it felt on their side they werenapost going to take any further action. Thataposs why I wanted to name and shame them on Facebook.Iaposd expect them to open a case and investigate the matter. Thereaposs clearly an issue at the warehouse. The cake-making business owner, who bakes from her home, plans to report the incident to the Food Standards Agency.  She said: I bake cakes for a living and have to go through hygiene standards for my job. This is revolting for me. Iaposve done my food hygiene standards certicate and I keep my kitchen clean. Making sure no pests get in is a priority. We wonapost be eating two of the boxes now, theyaposll be going straight in the bin. Iaposm going to report them to the Food Standards Agency today. It needs some investigation, especiallyAmazon is going to start selling more food products. An Amazon spokesperson said: We are working directly with the customer to make things right. A Graze spokesperson said: Weaposd like to offer our sincere apologies to Fiona for this experience and any concern caused. Ensuring that our products can always be enjoyed in the highest quality and condition is our priority and weaposre working closely with Amazon to urgently understand how this order has been delivered in this condition.

One officer claimed one lad was fine and a fire fighter wordlessly tossed a blanket over the other dead boyaposs head in front of his devastated parent. Angela Pearson and Sarah Turner had rushed to the scene upon hearing of a really bad accident involving their boys. Mrs Pearson was initially told her son Mason was fine, while Mrs Turner said she only learned George, , had died when she saw a firefighter throw a blanket over his head. Both lads were in one of two cars racing on the A, near Thirsk, when tragedy struck in March . Mrs Pearson was met by police stopping vehicles, and the Pc she spoke to radioed up and said that Mason was fine - he was alive. Once she was told her son had died, there didnapost seem to be a lot of compassion or empathy, she said.  We were sent on our merry way with no information about what to do, she added. Nobody came to see us and we didnapost receive a phone call - it was the longest night of our lives. Georgeaposs mum watched in horror as firefighters cut the victims free from the wreckage. After a while, the fire service turned the machinery and a big halogen lamp off and started to walk away, she said.  One of them came back and from about seven foot away he just threw a blanket over Georgeaposs head and that was the moment I knew heaposd gone, that image will live with me forever. Nobody said, aposcome and sit down, I need to explain somethingapos, she added, The boys were were passengers in a VW Bora being driven by Luke Ridley.  He was jailed for  years after admitting two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and five counts of causing serious injury. William Corser was in another car and racing Ridley when the crash happened between Busby Stoop and Carlton Miniott. He was jailed for  months after admitting dangerous driving. North Yorkshire Police said: We recognise that the way that we initially responded to and supported the two families of those who had died, in the aftermath of the collision, was below the standard we should have achieved and added to their distress.  We are very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short, and for any additional distress that was caused, and we would like to thank them for raising this with us so that we can ensure it does not happen again. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: This was a tragic, complex and extremely emotive incident involving multiple casualties, including a family member of a local responding firefighter.  Our aim is to treat all those involved with dignity and respect and we strive to learn where we can make improvements in our response to incidents. At the time of the incident it was revealed that a teenage boy left with severe injuries was the son of a firefighter. Heartbroken friends described Mason and George as top lads after they died at the scene of the three-vehicle crash.

Little Blake Nilssen suffered second-degree burns after toppling an unattended cleaning bucket while trying to stand up at the Little Dreams Nursery in Aberdeen. Staff covered him in paper towels but when they removed them it ripped off blisters that started to form. Staff allegedly failed to treat him for an hour because staff waited for parents to collect him instead of calling for an ambulance.The Care Inspectorate upheld multiple complaints against the nursery and ordered bosses to make immediate changes.  But the family is now considering a legal action and issued an urgent warning to parents over fears of a repeat tragedy. Devastated mum Ellie Johnson, , said when she picked her son up from nursery she could hear him screaming and described the ordeal as chilling. Ellie said: Blake faces being scarred for le and now we have a constant fear of knowing who to trust to take care of our son in the future. Little Dreams Nursery should be closed. This is utterly indefensible.  Blake was injured on Thursday November  in the aposbaby roomapos of the Little Dreams Nursery on Bon Accord Street in Aberdeen. He was attending the nursery since April three days per week at a cost of £ per day. Mum Ellie, who runs her own beauty business, dropped Blake off at .am but at .pm was told to collect her son as he managed to tip a bucket of water on himself. But Ellie and partner Daryl Nilssen, , only realised things were serious on arrival at the nursery.  Ellie, from Aberdeen, said: They said the water had a bit of bleach in it but that was it. There was no urgency in their voice and they didnapost say the water was boiling. We opened the door and heard the most horric screaming. It was chilling. Then we realised it came from our little boy. Thereaposs no words to describe the fear we felt at that moment.  The parents saw Blake in a room separate from the other children - he was stripped to his nappy and vest with his limbs covered in cling film and paper towels. Ellie added: He was screaming, his skin was red all over and there was an overwhelming smell of bleach with liquid running down his legs and arms from burst blisters. I screamed at the staff, grabbed Blake and drove to AE. Blake screamed so hard he lost consciousness a few times on the way, literally passing out from the pain.  At Aberdeen Royal Infirmary medics repeatedly rinsed Blake in a special shower room over  minutes and monitored the pH of his skin. A plastic surgeon burst the blisters and treated them with aloe vera gel before bandaging affected areas. Blake was also given small doses of morphine to ease the pain and help him sleep as he stayed at ARI for observation. The next day the tot was put under general anaesthetic for a skin scrub - his burns were dressed in six layers of bandages to aid healing and prevent infection.  Devastated father Daryl, an offshore worker, added: The whole situation was totally avoidable, should never have happened and cannot be allowed to happen again. Seeing your child in that kind of pain is something youaposre never prepared for and itaposs raised wider problems as we now worry about who we can trust next with our son. Ellie added: Blake is now on the road to recovery but this road is a long one. His physical scars will likely be permanent - we just pray the mental ones wont - so our focus now is making sure Blake is happy and healthy. But we still donapost have answers to the most obvious question - why was a bucket with boiling bleach left in a baby room  This wasnapost an accident - it was blatant negligence. Daryl and I really debated about next steps but we felt a sense of duty to highlight what happened so parents and other nurseries can be more mindful. The couple made  complaints to the Care Inspectorate - it sparked an immediate investigation and on Thursday November  an on-site inspection was carried out. Investigators - who even gave prior warning of the visit - said staff gave dfering accounts of what happened which also dfered from the incident forms. Inspectors also described nursery supervision as ineffective and criticised their use of paper towels and failing to call an ambulance. The report noted: It is our considered view that the inactions taken by the staff may have caused further complications to Blakeaposs injuries. Staff should have contacted the emergency services, immediately. They would have been able to give the right advice while awaiting an ambulance which would have minimised the pain and discomfort Blake must have been experiencing. The Care Inspectorate also raised concerns about staff not challenging decisions made by management. The report added: A qualied practitioner did not challenge the use of scalding water boiled from a kettle, and bleach in a bucket as dangerous despite telling us that she thought it was. Eight requirements were ordered against the nursery including making sure staff are first-aid trained and aware of emergency procedures. Other requirements included improvements to nursery housekeeping, awareness of whistleblowing policies and the ongoing training of staff. Neil Davidson, Partner at Digby Brown Solicitors in Aberdeen, is now supporting the young family. He said: What happened to Blake is horrendous. The trauma he and his parents experienced will endure for a long time so I praise their courage in speaking out. As parents we place the highest trust in those who care for our children and the Care Inspectorate quite rightly demanded improvements at this nursery. We will do all we can to help this young family recover and move on following this awful incident. A spokesman for Little Dreams Nursery said: “This was a very serious incident which was clearly deeply distressing for the child involved and the family. We take the safety of all the children in our care extremely seriously and whilst this was an isolated incident, we have fully investigated the causes. We reported the incident to the Care Inspectorate and worked with them to put in place new training and operational practices. We have been disappointed by some aspects of the reports from the Care Inspectorate and have appealed the findings, these discussions are still ongoing. However, this appeal process does not detract from the focus we have at the nursery to ensure we are operating safely.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesNurseriesHorric injuriesParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Itaposs been found to blend in with symptoms of seasonal illnesses from the flu and colds, to a grimy winter lurgy.Itaposs also come with new anxieties. Fears still linger about its high transmission rate and ability to avoid the first two vaccine doses for many.Now though, the US-based Center for Disease Control, or CDC, say that people with Covid can have “a wide range of symptoms”. In reality, this wide range can be everything from a slightly blocked nose to breathing dficulties requiring immediate medical attention. So, it is vital people are as well versed as possible when it comes to spotting the symptoms and taking tests as early as possible.One such symptom may be a little dferent to any others and is centred around your activities in the lavatory.Is diarrhoea an Omicron symptom   If when you pop to the bathroom you find you have diarrhoea, it could well be a sign that youaposve caught Omicron, the CDC said.NBC Chicago notes that people with compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms.These might be people recovering from Covid, although John Hopkins Medicine notes that around % are likely to experience diarrhoea as a symptom shortly after catching the virus.This is, of course, not the only symptom with others such as fatigue, breathing trouble, muscle and body aches, a headache or sore throat all also common symptoms.Diarrhoea is also not necessarily a symptom of Covid as many medical conditions feature it as a symptom. What are the symptoms of Omicron   At the time of writing, the CDC lists the following symptoms as those associated with Omicron: Fever or chillsCoughShortness of breath or dficulty breathingFatigueMuscle or body achesHeadache New loss of taste or smellSore throatCongestion or runny noseNausea or vomitingDiarrhoea The NHS currently advises that anyone with even mild symptoms of Omicron should: Get a PCR testto checkyou have COVID- as soon as possible. Stay at home and do not have visitorsuntil you get your test result – only leave your home to have a test. Checkpeople you live with need to self-isolate. You can leave isolation for medical attention or avoid harm in cases like domestic abuse. People will be able to leave isolation after seven daystheynegative lateral flow tests on days six and seven after beginning to isolate.Though,you continue to test positive you must isolate for the full  day period.From Tuesday, January , , people without symptoms will no longer need to get a PCR and can simply use lateral flow tests.It appears Omicron can be caught by people who have already had other strains of the virus, the Express reports.The UKHSA say: Self-isolate evenyouaposve had a positive test result for COVID- before.

And while there, he decided to sport a hilarious disguise of a fake moustache,  nose, joke glasses and a red hat. But it seemed the disguise brought him even more attention, as photos from the holiday over  years ago show.However, the prince seemed to take the situation in good humour, and according to the Daily Mail told photographers that the prince would not be coming out today. Taking on a dferent persona is something that Charles appears to have passed on to his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. While at university in St Andrews, Scotland, William decided to go by a dferent name as he was keen to go under the radar.

And the name he picked was Steve.

Charles, , has long been mocked for talking to plants – but now he can tell them he was right all along thanks to David Attenborough ’s BBC series.Executive producer Mike Gunton says: “He’s going to feel pretty vindicated because he was ahead of the game.” Presenter Sir David adds: “We don’t engage with plants enough.” The landmark series shows how plants can think and communicate with each other. An upcoming episode shows trees in British forests communicating using fungi networks which connect to the roots.  Mr Gunton says: “They call it the wood wide web. It’s like an internet. “The trees can both compete and collaborate with each other. So Prince Charles had it right all this time.” The prince told in  how talking to his plants helped them grow.

And his dad Prince William revealed that activity was carrying out litter picking sessions, which left his son frustrated about the state of the planet. Speaking to a BBC podcast last year, William ulged: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again.And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. William has been very vocal in the past  months about turning the tide on climate change and environmental problems.And heaposs previously said that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third-generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.  It is thought that George and Charlotteaposs younger brother Prince Louis will join them at the same school in September after he turns four in April.As part of William and Kateaposs wishes to give them as normal an upbringing as possible, as soon as they walk through the school gates their kids are treated like any other child.And this means they must do what teachers tell them and follow the schoolaposs most important rule - just like everyone . Its website states: As you would expect of any Thomasaposs school, the most important school rule is aposBe Kindapos.

The Government wants to ban the little plastic packets including the nation’s favourite condiments. As a result takeaways will have to find an ex-friendly alternative or people will be forced to have chips without a dollop of red sauce.According to The Sun, the list of items could also extend to mini milk containers and throwaway cutlery.Environment Secretary George Eustace said last year evidence found the single-use packets ‘can cause considerable harm to the marine and terrestrial environment when disposed of incorrectly’. A source said: “They’re an obvious contender for a ban. There’s no reason most restaurants can’t use big bottles instead of sachets.”  The move was met with a mixed reaction online. One person tweeted: “So they are going to ban condiment sachets and looking to ban all single use plastic cutlery, plates etc. “NO!! Sorry but this is just ridiculous. Just stop right now. The government does not get to just ban stuff all the time. “The implications of this are far reaching, restaurants will have to discard more stuff and artist materials etc are also disposable too.”  More than  billion plastic sachets are said to be used around the world each year. It is believed they would take around  years to decompose. Andrew Crook, Deputy Chair of the British Takeaway Campaign warned the move could have an impact on smaller restaurants, which should be given time to find another solution. He added: It’s right that the nation reduces its plastic consumption, but we’ve got to do so without adding another costly burden on the smallest restaurants, many of which are struggling to keep their doors open. Our favourite takeaways wouldn’t be the same without the sauces on the side, so the Government should give small restaurants time to find affordable, non-plastic alternatives, and not lumber them with other changes too soon either, like the proposed cutlery and polystyrene cup ban.

The violent scenes erupted at the superstore when security tried to apprehend a pair of alleged shoplters on Sunday afternoon, January . Dramatic mobile phone footage shows a Tesco worker at the store in Aston, Birmingham, swinging at one of the suspects as he pleads: Donapost hit me, Iaposve got nothing to do with it. The same store bouncer then runs over to another person being grappled by staff and aggressively delivers several heavy MMA-style elbows to his back. The person filming the footage can be heard saying: Itaposs getting silly in here. Itaposs all mad. Heaposs mashing him up here. Oh s**t. Meanwhile, an elderly woman can be seen walking into shot and casually continuing her shopping as the violence breaks out around her. West Midlands Police confirmed they were called to the superstore on Aston Lane at .pm on Sunday after a Tesco staff member was punched in the face.The agency security guard involved is now subject of an internal investigation and is not currently working at the store. A police spokeswoman said: We are investigating reports of an assault at Tesco in Aston at .pm on Sunday . We understand there was a fight between security staff and a suspected thief, during which a staff member was punched in the face. As part of our investigation, weaposll be speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV. Weaposll also review videos that we know have been posted online. Anyone with information can contact us via Live Chat on our website or by calling . Please quote crime reference number   . One witness, who did not want to be named, said the brawl broke out after security guards stopped two people on suspicion of stealing booze. They said: It all got a bit crazy and one of the security guards appeared to be very heavy-handed. He swung for one of the lads and then elbow dropped the other. His own colleagues had to pull him off at one point. Iaposm not sure his bosses are going to be very happy as he clearly lost his temper but I think he got a whack in the face himself. At one point one of the fellas tried to bite him as well so you can understand him losing his rag a little but it was still pretty unprofessional of him to react as he did. The footage, obtained by the Birmz Is Grime blog, has since been viewed over , times after being uploaded to social media. One web user commented: Bros been watching too much UFC lately, that elbow to the back bro. Another wrote: Thought this Security Guard was supposed to escort him off the premises, not go all MMA on his Ass. A third put: The security guard should not be behaving like that @Tesco why are you employing wannabe gangsters that canapost regulate their emotions when at work  However, others praised the security guardaposs actions with one writing: That security guard needs a pay rise. Another added: Little scrotes need teaching a lesson, might make them think twice now in future. A Tesco spokesperson said: We are aware of this incident and are assisting the police with their enquiries.

On Sunday Health Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped the UK aposwill be one of the first major economies to demonstrate to the world how you transition from pandemic to endemicapos. But the figures show that despite such boasts Britain has had the fourth highest number of infections in the world and the seventh largest number of deaths per country. The UK has suffered , deaths during the  months since the pandemic began, a number which continues to rise and is far higher than what comparable countries like Germany, Italy and France. Prof Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the Mirror: The UK’s record is a story in two parts  He said the science had been world class and the NHS had been fantastic but on the other hand the country had been led by a massive political failure. He was far from alone in highlighting the huge successes of scientists and health workers in this country, and contrasting it to a lack of political support or common sense. Here we look at just how aposworld beatingapos the UKaposs Covid performance has been. INFECTIONS The UK has the fourth highest number of infections worldwide, behind the US, India and Brazil.For much of the pandemic, two of those countries were led by presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, who played down the danger of the virus or flat out said it was not a threat.Indiaaposs Narendra Modi, was accused of approaching the pandemic with “indference” and prioritising politics over public health as he threw huge political rallies despite the risk.. To date the UK has registered .M confirmed Covid cases, with the daily number of infections soaring into six figures just before Christmas. With a population of M this counts for a signicant portion of the home nations having had the virus, even accounting for reinfections. When broken down per capita, the UK ranks th globally for cases per million people.  DEATHS The UK has the seventh highest death toll from Covid on the planet with , and the worst in Europe. The US is the worst with approximately , deaths, followed by Brazil on , and India on ,. When population is taken into account the UK ranks th globally with . deaths per , people. In January  the UK was recording nearly , deaths a day, and in the year since deaths have remained around or above  people a day. This means around , people have died since the vaccine campaign took full effect.VACCINESThe UK fares much better when it comes to the vaccine roll-out. The country was one of the first nations to begin administering the le-saving jabs, beginning on December , , with -year-old Margaret Keenan. Since then, the UK has given ,, jabs. The vaccine campaign was successful in bringing down the deadliest wave of the pandemic, and has allowed some semblance of normal le since.  At times, the effort to vaccinate the nation has meant more than  million Brits getting the jab a day. However, at other times, despite their successes, the government has let the campaign slump to far lower rates and been sluggish with pushing ahead with jabs, or preparing for school s after summer. When it comes to doses per  residents, the UK ranks th, ahead of the likes of the US, Germany and France. And in boosters, the UK ranks fourth globally too.  VACCINE DONATIONS As a global pandemic, vaccines are not just a domestic issue but an international one. There has been criticism of Western nations for not doing enough to ensure other, less prosperous countries have enough doses of the vaccine for their populations. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has accused the richest countries of stockpiling vaccine and that lives have been lost as a result. According to Covax, an organisation dedicated to ensuring equitable and total access to jabs for everyone, wherever they live, the UK has promised M jabs. So far it has only delivered .m of them. This is roughly in step with other Western nations, at a rate largely accepted to be still not fast enough.  WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY  The UK has seen a tale of two pandemics, according to experts, with successes in the work of scientists and the health service contrasted by frequent political failure. Prof Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the Mirror : The UK’s record is a story in two parts. The science has been world class. We obviously think about the Oxford vaccine, but perhaps more important but less visible has been the RECOVERY trials, which showed what works , the OpenSAFELY work on data linkage, and the genome sequencing.Also the NHS has been fantastic, creating new models of care and rolling out the vaccine programme.On the other hand it has been a massive political failure. The Westminster government has consistently failed to engage with those on the ground, launching expensive and ineffective initiatives like the tracing programme. There has never been a clear strategy and messaging has been confused, likely because the Prime Minister struggles to reconcile the science and the ideology of his back benchers.He also struggles with the legacy of a decade of austerity that has left our institutions weakened and the toxic distraction of Brexit.Michael McLennan, the founder and Chief Exec of Covid:Aid, a UK national Covid charity, also agreed that the pandemic had revealed the very best of the UK at times during the pandemic. He continued: Brilliant scientists and academic experts have led the way in protecting and saving lives, and there have been an amazing array of everyday heroes throughout the country – including key workers such as NHS and public sector staff, and also those helping out friends, family, and even complete strangers through acts of generosity.  However, we at Covid:Aid have also seen the horric effects it has had on those suffering from Long Covid, grief and bereavement, loneliness and isolation, and a range of other traumatic issues.There needs to be greater support, and already we are hearing from more and more who feel left behind – it will be a national tragedy should we ignore those who are most vulnerable, and those disadvantaged groups who continue to be at signicant risk from the effects of coronavirus.We cannot forget the , lives already lost, the thousands more that will be lost this year, and the millions whose lives will never be the same again.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Narendra ModiNadhim ZahawiBoris JohnsonCare homesPoliticsCoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Here’s everything you need to know about the rule change and when you will still be expected to do a PCR testA major rule change means fewer people need to take a PCR test to confirmthey are Covid positive Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika Padin:,  Jan | comments A new Covid testing rule has come into effect in England as of today, January , under which fewer people will be required to get a PCR to test for infection. Under this rule, someone who tests positive on a lateral flow test will no longer need to get a follow-up PCRthey have no symptoms of the virus. If you have a positive lateral flow test, you will need to self-isolate immediately. Since you no longer need to double check with a PCR, this means your -day self-isolation period starts earlier. If you get a negative lateral flow on day six and seven, then you can even end your self-isolation early.Despite the new rule, there are still over a dozen reasons when you still have to get a PCR test.  The government has outlined certain exceptions to the rule change. For instance, you should always get a PCR testyou have symptoms of Covid, regardless of the result of lateral flow.This includes not just the three classic signs of high temperature, new or persistent cough and loss of smell or taste, but the more unusual symptoms that are being increasingly reported.You should also get a PCR doneyouaposve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive, evenyou are fully vaccinated.  There are many other reasons to get a PCR test in England under government guidance.

She has since had the tumour removed and been given the all-clear. Now, she is crediting the weight loss with saving her le - saying otherwise, she would never have found the lump. The tumour was really close to my chest wall, so close in fact that it didnapost even get picked up on the mammogram,” she said. If I hadnapost lost all that weight, I would never have found the tumour as early as I did, and my story could have been very dferent to the one I am sharing today. Caught early, breast cancer treatment has a much higher success rate, so Slimming World has well and truly saved my le.

When I had my second daughter, Isabelle, who is now , my weight fluctuated up and down - le makes you fluctuate. In July  I decided it was time for a change. The bigger clothes were getting tighter, and it was time to do something about it. Everything happened so quickly, I was referred to Lancashire Breast Clinic and before I knew it, I had been diagnosed with stage  breast cancer. Andrea underwent two operations, as the first one was unable to remove all of the tumours, followed by intensive radiotherapy treatment which ended five months later. She finally got to ring the bell at the Rosemere Cancer Centre in Preston on Christmas Eve  with her eldest daughter Elizabeth, , by her side.

But there is one child she is desperate to see again, the boy who turned out to be her own son by her husband Paul.Carole gave birth to the lb oz baby in June , believing he was another couple’s child, created from her egg but with the sperm of the other husband. But the couple carried out a DNA test six weeks after the birth and discovered the baby was by Carole’s husband Paul. Carole and Paul agreed they could still adopt him, a decision Carole does not regret, but she was devastated when contact with the couple broke down, and now thinks of her son “all the time”.  She is now on the Adoption Contact Register hoping he would like to meet her when he turns  this year. Carole, whose achievement has been entered in the Guinness World Records, says: “I am immensely proud of my surrogacy career and having  babies who are loved by their families. “Surrogacy has brought me and the families I helped immeasurable joy, but also led to the darkest times of my le. “Surrogacy is the ultimate gt that one woman can do for another. “But there is a darker side when it goes wrong – the heartbreak, emotional roller- coaster and acrimony are devastating.”  Sadly that was the case with her ninth surrogate baby. She says: “This little boy was accidentally created with an act of love between my partner and I. We didn’t know it when we handed him over. “We agonised over what to do, but in the end decided to let them keep him. “People have asked, ‘How could you give this baby away as this one is yours ’, but many of the surrogate babies I have given away have been mine biologically. “The dference was he was also Paul’s. We have never stopped thinking about him. We live in hope he is aware of us and, when he turns , he’d like to see us.” In , Carole agreed to become a surrogate for the UK-based mother and self-inseminated with sperm from the businessman husband. Surrogates were advised not to have sex at all until they were pregnant, but Carole thought that was unrealistic. She says: “I never promised that I would never have sex, but my husband and I took precautions.” When she became pregnant the couple were overjoyed. They attended scans and the birth and Carole stayed with them for a week afterwards. But six weeks later the furious father phoned the surrogacy agency to tell them a DNA test showed the baby was not his. A second test confirmed it. Carole says: “It was just a terrible situation for everyone. I remember repeatedly saying to the surrogacy agency, ‘Do they want him ’ “As a surrogate you are having a baby for someone  – you don’t bond, you haven’t prepared for a child, in fact for nine months you are mentally distancing yourself from the baby. “But we also had to make a decision – what were we going to dothey did hand him back  And what were we going to do now we had the knowledge he was biologically ours ” Paul, now , is Carole’s second husband and they had no children together, although both had children from previous relationships. Carole, , from Colchester, Essex, who has two daughters of her own, says: “We had an honest and open discussion about whether we would keep him or put him up for adoption. “In the end, Paul made the decision. He said, ‘If they don’t want him, we will bring him up’. We decidedthey still loved him and wanted to keep him, we would let him stay with them. “The decision was immense, as this little boy was dferent because he was my partner’s too – and we hadn’t had a child together. While it was an agonising decision, I still think it was the right one for him and his parents. “I’d spent nine months believing this child was theirs and psychologically distancing myself from him.“I didn’t emotionally invest in the pregnancy, as it would break your heart every time you handed a child over.“He’d been with them for six weeks – and I’d already begun thinking of the next couple I was going to help. “They’d loved him from the moment of his conception and nurtured him – I’d just provided the womb. I was able to carry a baby without emotionally connecting with them. “It was only when I nurtured my two daughters after their birth that I bonded and loved them as a mother should.” After the boy was adopted by the couple, Carole says they kept in contact by post for a few years. But “relations were completely broken down” and the letters stopped. She says: “I am in contact with almost all of my surrogate babies – but not him. As the years pass we think about him all the time. Paul has developed a heart condition and it would break my hearthe never met him.” Carole admits she looked for her son on social media and found a picture of him, aged six or seven, on his mum’s Facebook profile.She says: “It is a natural curiosityyou have created a human being to know about them. “I’ve never seen his creation as a mistake. It was a blip… but a blip that created a wonderful human being. So I can honestly say I don’t regret it. But what I do deeply regret is not having any contact at all.” She is now looking to June when he turns . Carole says: “When babies are adopted you can register an interest and leave a letter so that once they turn  they can find out who you are andyou want contact. “So I’ve written a letter and hopefully,he knows about his background, he’ll want to get to know us. “I have thought more about this surrogate child than any of the others. I can honestly say I’d be heartbrokenhe didn’t want to know us.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesLovePregnancyWorld recordsAdoptionSurrogacyDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He continued: The other day Alice tells me she and her friend are going to a shelter and she’s planning to pick out a cat. I told her I wouldn’t want her to get one and she said she’s always wanted a cat and has planned to get one since before she met me. I told her it was so inconsiderate of her to get the cat because I am allergic and whatwe decide to move in together one day  I said I don’t see this working outshe plans to keep the cat. She told me I’m overreacting and we just started dating so I shouldn’t try to aposcontrolapos her and that I told her it’s fine so now she already has the cat. I insisted she take it back and she said she was not going to, so I said fine it’s the cat or me. The argument ended with her telling him that she needed space. I talked to a female friend about this who said I’m being [the a**hole] andAlice can apostake birth control every dayapos for me then I can apostake a Benadryl and chill,apos he continued. But when he confided in a male friend, he told him Alice is inconsiderate. Reddit users were quick to put him in his place, with many people saying that they hope she picks the cat over him.

Only two weeks later, I got a job offer, which I accepted. I didn’t say anything about my pregnancy as it’s so early, she explained on Redditaposs AITA forum.I’ve also heard of employers discriminating against pregnant workers by not hiring them, and I wanted to avoid that.  Things were going well for the mum-to-be, until last week when she decided to tell a few family members about both the new job and the pregnancy. One of them asked meI told the boss about being pregnant. When I said no, he got disapproving and said I shouldn’t have lied about it, she continued. I didn’t say anything, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong. My goal is to protect myself and the baby’s wellbeing, and having a job with maternity leave and a guarantee of work when Iwill help me. The mum then turned to Reddit to question whether others agreed with her decision not to reveal her pregnancy to her new employer. You gotta look out for you. Youaposre under no legal obligation to disclose and they arenapost even allowed to ask either, one Reddit user commented. Another added: You didnapost lie about being pregnant. You simply didnapost volunteer it, and the employer didnapost violate the law by asking. You didnapost need to disclose, plusyou are before  weeks along, it is still REALLY early. However, another disagreed: I think youaposre in the wrong unless youaposre really stellar and donapost count on keeping that job. You gotta do whataposs best for you so itaposs justied but itaposs gonna suck for your coworkersthey have to pick up your slack especiallyyou were supposed to come in to ease up the workload. It also sucks for the employerthey are smaller as they would much rather have hired someone  but it shouldnapost really matterthey are a larger company. And this will probably have negative repercussions because whoever did the hiring may be more reluctant to hire younger women because this situation may remain with them.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

After being misdiagnosed, she found her le getting much smaller as her vision gradually declined. She had no idea how her adult daughter looked, and last saw her eldest grandchild when they were just three weeks old. Doctors told her that she was suffering from detached retinas or glaucoma. But the diagnosis was incorrect – she actually had cataracts, which could be removed easily and restore her sight. After having the surgery, the mum now has   vision in both eyes after being left blind for  YEARS. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Emotional Connie has spoken about how it felt when surgery finally restored her vision last year, after an ophthalmologist diagnosed cataracts, one of the most common adult vision issues. Connie, from Aurora, Colorado, USA, said: “People need to get rechecked because I was blind for  years probably for no reason. Theyaposve been doing cataract surgeries for years.” She added: “The day the retina specialist told me he saw no diseased retinas, my husband and I instantly got upset.  “I had a little resentiment towards the doctors that couldn’t find anything wrong or told me all these things were wrong, but the God’s honest truth is the day they took the patch off my eye, and I could see, it took all that anger away.” Connie first began noticing halos and prisms on car lights while driving in  and went to a doctor who told her she had glaucoma. “Three weeks later, I had lost even more sight and peripheral vision,” she said.  The mum was told that her loss of vision was sadly inoperable and she would become blind. “I didnapost believe it until I started hurting myself,” she said.“I was getting lost, falling down stairs, falling up stairs and setting myself and my house on fire. I had lost over % of my sight in five and a half months.”In a drastic move to reclaim her independence, she relocated from Montana to Denver, Colorado in , to attend blind school.  Determined not to let her blindness stop her, she continued doing outdoorsy things she had always loved, such as ice skating, kayaking, camping and attending sporting events and concerts. “I was so happy to be in the nosebleeds screaming my lungs out and not seeing anything,” she said. I just lived le as much as I possibly could the way I did before I lost my sight.” But there were some major things that were dficult to adjust to - and she lost some of her independence. “I wasnapost really sure to how to use a cane and I would keep walking into bushes,” she said.  “I had to have somebody with me when I cooked to make sure the food looked okay. I couldn’t vacuum and had to sweep in a pattern.” In , Connie was referred to the UCHealth Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center and the ophthalmologist told her she was suffering not from a detached retina, but very dense cataracts and suggested surgery. “On November th, the doctor did my right eye. When they took my patch off the next day the first thing I saw was the nurse’s eyebrow, eyelashes and pupil and I started crying,” Connie said. “She had me read an eye chart and the first line I read was  .  “I think the doctor was as surprised as me because he had made it perfectly clear he wasn’t promising me measurable vision. “I had the second eye done and right after Thanksgiving, I was seeing   out of both eyes. Now, Connie has retired her guide dog Talulah Mae to a regular dog and has a job as a unit clerk with UCHealth. She has been able to see her eldest grandchild for the first time since she was an infant, and her other eight grandkids for the first time ever.  “The eldest doesnapost look anything like she looked when she was three weeks old,” Connie joked. She also enjoys watching things that most people take for granted. “I got to watch all the flowers bud and the trees grow leaves,” she said. “People think itaposs tedious to watch grass grow, but when you havenapost seen a blade of grass in years, you watch the grass grow.” She added that it was painful to see herself ageing. “The hardest thing was looking in the mirror, because I never thought about myself aging,” she said. “I had no idea who that was looking back at me.” She was, however, happy to see her husband Robert again. “He’s still the most handsome man ever and Iaposm still completely in love with him,” she said. Now, she’s excited to retake the vacations the couple had been on when she was blind. “He took me to the Oregon coast, Yellowstone and all through the Rockies. Now I just want to go see it again,” she said. “Well, I want to go see it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DisabilityViralVision Care\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I showed her a picture of how I wanted them and when she was done she said apostheyaposre a bit more full than you wantedapos so straight away that was a big red flag, Jasmine, who is originally from North Wales, recalled.  She showed me them in the mirror and I wanted to cry because I really didnapost like them. She had managed to glue the top lashes with some of my bottom lashes so one of my eyes was a bit glued together and I couldnapost open it properly. I was sat in the car after trying to detach my bottom lashes and I had to yank some fake lashes out which pulled some of my natural eyelashes out as well. After that they were okay for about a week but then they got really painful - my eyes felt really hot and itchy. They stung so much and kept watering. However, things went from bad to worse when the teen woke up the next morning and couldnapost open her eyes at all, sending her into a panic. I couldnapost see anything and I didnapost know what was wrong. I felt my eyes and they were glued together with that gooey stuff eyes get, she said. I got hot salty water to try and wash it off but it was so solid I had to start picking it off and it was pulling more eyelashes out.  Jasmine visited her doctor when she woke up the following day with her eyes crusted shut again and was prescribed creams, eye drops and tablets to tackle the allergic reaction. After removing the problematic eyelash extensions herself she has now been left with aposgappyapos natural eyelashes and continued inflammation of her eyes and eyelids. Jasmine said: When I got them done I never knew anything like that couldaposve happened. I just thought the worst that could happen is theyaposd get a bit itchy but they were so painful and swollen, it was awful. I had eyelash remover serum so I rubbed that along the lashline and used Vaseline as well and combed through my lashes. I didnapost manage to get them all off for about a month. The irritation hasnapost fully gone away, they still get swollen now. Immediately after the lashes were off and I was still having eye issues I had barely any lashes, my eyes were basically bald. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The student had a smoother experience of getting her eyelashes done a year earlier with another beautician who applied a patch test behind her ear.She found the new lash technician on Instagram after a friendaposs recommendation and opted for full volume, Russian-style lashes that were on offer for £ at the time.Jasmine claims the new beautician never mentioned a patch test, leaving her thinking it wasnapost a necessity. But after her horror allergic reaction and being left with an almost aposbaldapos lash line, she is now urging all eyelash extension customers to request a patch test. Jasmine said: The lady who previously did my eyelashes did a patch test behind my ear but I didnapost really think much of it. When this girl didnapost do it I just thought maybe thataposs something the other girl just does but then I found out afterwards that theyaposre all supposed to. My eyelashes are just starting to grow back now so I can put mascara on again. If theyaposve healed enough one day, which I imagine could take years, then I would get them done again but definitely make sure to get a patch test. Everyone should make sure they get a patch test and know the ingredients of the gluethey can because clearly Iaposm allergic to whatever was in that glue.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Then he remembered a conversation heaposd had with a coworker, Jen, and how she was a little surprised when he said he no longer went to church. He then approached Jen and she admitted that she had got his name in the secret Santa ring, and had chosen not to buy him anything as he was aposprofiting offapos the religious holiday. Do you think Christmas is just for Christians  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: A few days before Christmas we all were supposed to exchange our gts. I gave the person I picked their gt and then I was waiting to receive mine, I didnapost know who picked me of course but eventually it seemed like everyone had gotten their gts except me. Then Jen came over and said she was the one who picked my name, but since I didnapost believe in Christmas there was no reason for her to get me a gt in celebration of it. I was honestly shocked but she left before I could say anything. It did bother me a bit but I decided to let it go because I didnapost want any drama.  A friend, named Amy, learned of what happened to the man and she encouraged him to report it, but he insisted he didnapost want any trouble so left it at that. But when he ed from his Christmas break he was called into his bossaposs office who wanted to know the whole story, and they then said they would be having a chat with Jen. He continued: Yesterday I noticed Jenaposs desk was cleared out, I asked Amy about it and she said Jen had been fired.  I feel bad because I didnapost care about getting a present that much and I donapost think itaposs something that warrants getting someone fired. After sharing his story online, the man was inundated with advice from strangers who said it was a good thing the boss got involved. One said: She didnapost get fired for not getting you a present, she got fired for the things she said and did. She did this to herself, not you. While a second added: Her behaviour got her fired, not you being honest when asked a question by your supervisor. And a third wrote: Your coworker got herself fired for trying to stick her personal beliefs where they donapost belong and showing blatant prejudice towards other people in the office. Telling the truth about what happened landed your work environment and coworkers in a less toxic place.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Sometimes items arrive looking exactly as described but others... itaposs a little disappointing.Sadly, one Amazon knows this all too well after ordering a cute little black dress from TikTok, only for it to arrive and barely protect her modesty. The TikTok user, who goes by the name Girlfriend online, bought a fullblack dress with a plunging neckline and extremely high slits up the front, which leave very little to the imagination. Posting from her handle @girlfriendxoxoxo, she explained: So I bought a new dress off Amazon. It looked really really cute online, but on me... I’m just dying. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. This is the dress. I’m laughing because I just can’t decide what to do. There’s not enough fabric here and there’s definitely not enough fabric here, continued, while laughing her head off. I’m giggling, sorry, because it’s funny to me - I have a very cute body but I’ve been duped by Amazon, dammit! Despite her giggles, many of her followers were quick to comment saying just how good she looks in the dress. That is absolutely gorgeous on you, one wrote, while another added: I love the way it looks! A third wrote: Itaposs such a cute dress though, is there any chance youaposd be able to tailor it ! Fortunately, the creative woman was able to find a work around to make the dress work, and ended up styling it with a gorgeous black corset on top and it looks amazing.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Houssainatou, , began suffering with pain in her mouth when she was just a toddler and her family were shocked to see the lump grow over the years. With the facial tumour eventually protruding from the little girlaposs face and forcing her to quit school at just eight years old, her father Souleymane feared his daughter would struggle and die young. Incredibly, doctors managed to save the young girlaposs le with surgery onboard a hospital ship.The facial tumour was removed and the ten-year-old girl is now living a normal le at home with her grateful family.Maize farmer Souleymane, who lives in a town in the highlands of Guinea with his we, daughter Houssainatou and her four siblings, said: I cannot believe it. She is so beautul! I am so happy and so excited to bring her home to see the family.  I can only get enough food to feed my family, but not extra. Iaposd never have the means to take care of surgery for my daughter. We kept praying, and worrying, and looking for help. My heart is free now. The fear is gone. I used to spend every day afraid she would die young, but now I will spend my time helping her have a future. The proud father added: I want her to become a doctor so she can help people the way she herself has been helped. The le-saving surgery came thanks to Mercy Ships - a charity which delivers free le-saving surgery in west and central Africa. Houssainatou underwent several rounds of patient selection screenings before she was accepted for free surgery onboard hospital ship, the aposAfrica Mercyapos. After just one day and a four hour surgery, Houssainatou was able to see herself in the mirror, tumour-free, for the first time in her young le and is now living le to the fullest.

The rock, dubbed Asteroid  YD by NASA, is set to come within .million miles of our planet today as it whizzes through space.The asteroid measures a massive -metres wide making it wider than famous Westminster landmark Big Ben is tall. Despite its impressive size, it is slightly too small to be considered a potentially hazardous object - a name given to space junk discovered by the space agency that could prove a threat.While confirmed for today, NASA did not give an exact time this asteroid would be visiting. Another asteroid - which is far larger than YD and roughly two and a half times the size of the Empire State Building - is set to swing by Earth on January  at .pm Eastern time . Asteroid PC - which is .km in diameter- will be hurtling through space .million miles away from Earth.It will be our closest encounter with this particular asteroid for at least the next  years, according to inverse.And itaposs so close that amateur astronomers may be able to catch a glimpse from their gardens, according to the publication.  Relating to todayaposs rock, the .million-mile gap may seem massive, but is actually rather modest in space terms. In fact NASA classies anything that passes within million miles of Earth as a Near-Earth Object . Due to the distances they fly in from, tiny changes in their trajectories could be of concern for Earth scientists. Scientists track thousands of these to observe how close they are coming to Earth. And  YD is not the only asteroid set to become a Near-Earth Object in the coming weeks. There are three more that are set to pass by the globe before it does so. The  YK, which measures m wide, will fly within ,miles of the planet this Sunday. And then  YE, which is a measly m wide, will pass by on January , getting within .million miles of Earth. The third and final asteroid is  AP, the smallest at only m across, and passing on January , at .million miles from us.

Prince Giacomo Bonanno di Linguaglossa, , is believed to have met -year-old Tanya Yashenko, from Belarus, at a dinner party in . It is said the couple enjoyed a whirlwind romance, holidaying in destinations such as Monte Carlo, Dubai and the Males. The Times reported he also gave her a Mercedes worth €,, a €, share in a Rome bed and breakfast, expensive jewellery and €, to help her to rent a flat in the centre of Rome. According to Italian media, Yashenko filed a legal complaint against the prince last year, alleging that he was stalking her and hired a psychiatrist to assist with her case.However, newspaper Il Messaggero reports that the expert has now switched sides and accuses Yashenko of taking advantage of the psychological fragility of Linguaglossa.The Italian press also reportedly obtained text messages exchanged between the pair, where she criticised the prince for not being generous enough.

It is claimed the prince was left traumatised after the break-up of his earlier marriage. Yashenko has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that the prince withdraw his accusations. At the weekend, the Italian prince took to his Facebook page, where he said he wanted to “publicly apologise to my partner Tanya Yashenko for my  statements.

He has certainly not withdrawn his accusations and will not do so.“He is still very fragile and the love affair has clouded his judgment.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le. But nothing compares to a visit to the village to view the locations and feel the presence of all this history, with brilliantly illustrated information and interpretative  by the society to guide your imagination.What has been achieved by Aberlady Conservation and History Society was summed up by Ruth Parsons, chief executive of Historic Environment Scotland, who has said: “The incredible work done by Aberlady Conservation and History Society has brought previously unknown history to light.

BMW iXBMWs new flagship electric car – the iX – scored a full five stars in recent Euro NCAP safety tests. It scored particularly well for adult occupant protection, ing a % score for this, while its child occupant safety score of % was also good.It was also praised for its numerous safety assist systems, including an active bonnet that can cushion the blow for a pedestrian in the instance of a collision and its comprehensive automatic emergency braking system.. Mercedes-Benz EQSIt wasnt just BMWs flagship EV that did well in recent safety tests. Mercedes-Benzs range-topping EQS also scored a full five stars under examination recently. The luxury saloon ed an adult occupant safety rating of %, while child occupant safety was also excellent with a score of %.A full suite of assistance systems helped it gain an % score for safety assist, while its protection against vulnerable road users was rated at %.. Skoda FabiaIt wasnt just high-end electric cars that scored well recently. Skoda has a good reputation for safety and its latest Fabia only extended this further, with its five-star rating. Marks of % and % were recorded for adult occupant and child occupant protection respectively, showing this compact car could easily compete with the bigger cars here.It also scored an impressive % for vulnerable road user protection. It missed out on the safety assist top marks, as it lacks active bonnet technology or emergency braking when in reverse.. Genesis GGenesis might be a relative newcomer to the UK, but it is already making great strides through its steady stream of new models, which, according to recent tests, are very safe too. The new G scored a full five stars too – impressive given its not based on a brand-new .Euro NCAP awarded it % for adult occupant protection, as well as % for child occupant protection. It did particularly well in terms of safety assistance technology too, receiving a score of %.. Volkswagen CaddyThe award of five stars to Volkswagens Caddy shows its not just conventionally shaped cars that can do well in terms of safety.

Tests also revealed the Caddy offered good protection to children sitting in a iety of dferent car seats across all three rows of seats.. Ford Mustang Mach-eFords Mustang Mach-e was yet another large EV toa full five stars in recent tests.

Toyota Yaris CrossToyotas quirky Yaris Cross did impressively well in recent tests. Its particularly note-worthy because of the cars compact size and relatively diminutive footprint on the road: this didnt stop it from scoring % for adult occupant safety and % for child occupant safety.It also scored full points for rescue and extrication thanks to its multi-collision brake system and eCall technology, which can automatically inform the emergency servicesthe vehicle is involved in an incident."},{"url":null,"title":"change-bbcs-andrew-marr-show---better","story":"So it was that Sophie Raworth found herself yesterday making the news instead of presenting it, as the host of what was The Andrew Marr Show and is now the plainly titled Sunday Morning.That is another downside to a January launch: there is so little  happening, newspapers run stories about your debut asit was a new play or film. How, then, did it go for Raworth Before we could find out, politics show watchers began the day, as is traditional, with Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Having started his run last May as a maternity cover for Sophy Ridge, Phillips was the future once . Now he is the longest serving presenter in post.His first interview of  was with Nadhim Zahawi, former Vaccines Minister now Education Secretary for England and, for this day only, Minister for the Sunday shows.Mr Zahawi had already set the direction of the day with a Sunday Times interview in which he said it would be “helpful”the quarantine period could be cut from seven days to five.He also, according to the report, said free lateral flow tests were on the way out. In front of the cameras, though, he said that was not the case. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards. The signing of Piers Morgan to talkTV shows which way Rupert Murdoch sees the wind blowing.Alternatively, having had a taste of news and views mixing to a greater extent than before, UK audiences could be ready toto the more traditional fare offered by the main channels.Despite the dull title, Sunday Morning might prove to be a lively arrival after all."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scotland-without-covid-funding-london","story":"“Our public health response is curtailed by lack of finance” she said last month, after the UK government added another £m of new money for Covid response. It doesn’t matter how much Westminster gives Holyrood – it will never be enough.What the Covid crisis shows is how much better Scotland is as part of the Union rather than separated from the world’s fth largest economy, with no central bank, no currency, no national grid, and with a government that wants to shut down North Sea gas and oil.From the rapid and unique development of the Astra Zeneca vaccine, free from the constraints of the European Medical Agency, through the support of the British Army, the roll-out of millions of free lateral flow tests , to the sharing and pooling of medical science across the four nations, the case for the Union speaks for itself.William Loneskie, Lauder.TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE SNPNICOLA Sturgeon’s stance on lateral flow test kits being freely available betrays the core problem with SNP policies: great on the surface, huge problems underneath. Health minister Humza Yousaf is in the same boat .Lateral flow kits are expensive and, like all “free items” on the NHS, prone to abuse. Add in John Swinney’s exhortation to basically use one every time you go out, and not only does the bill rise alarmingly, so does the mountain of plastic waste.Mr Yousaf is not taking into account the damage to commerce nor staff availability nor even the mental health of many Scots.Ms Sturgeon effectively cancelled the holiday period for many and did huge collateral damage to the economy. The SNP is one-dimensional, focussing only on theof time until indyref, but there are three “normal” dimensions plus time and space.The government isn’t coping with the breadth or height of the problems it is facing, and time is running out for the SNP as is space for the endless excuses as to why little is working properly in Scotland today.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE TEST KITS WHILE fully supporting the ongoing current pandemic injection campaign and the regime for frequent use of lateral flow tests, I cannot help but feel a gnawing and growing unease about the veritable mountain of many millions of single-use pieces of plastic we are creating, destined for landfill, this being anathema to the Greens among us.I also wonderany attempt is being made to reclaim and recycle the tonnes of, presumably high-grade stainless steel, from the teeming multitude of used syringe needles David J O’Hara, Scotstoun, Glasgow.THE UK MEDIA’S HARMFUL VIEW OF THE EUDAVID Leask’s article on “Scotland’s skin-deep relationship with the EU”highlights some crucial issues, not least the Scots’ affection but lack of detailed knowledge about the signicance of EU membership.That “we are not remotely interested in its detail” is in part true. That Scots “…do not keep up with what is happening in the EU or in its member states…and neither do our politicians” has been deeply concerning, but no surprise.Why might this be  During our tenure as members of the EU, the UK media largely ignored the wide-ranging signicance of our membership, unless an ‘EU bad’ headline was lazily accessible.I was always struck through my involvement with other member states how their national and, more importantly, regional press regularly featured balanced pieces on a new piece of legislation, new consultation, speeches or visits by Commissioners or delegations.By contrast, it was evident that large sections of the UK press indulged in clear campaigns of misinformation which at times verged on the ludicrous. The EU would fairly regularly send measured rebuttals to editors across the UK, but I cannot recall ever seeing these being published.Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter and sometimes it does. Our collective poor record in informing the public did however play a large part in the dreadful and internationally embarrassing decision to withdraw from the EU, the consequences of which we have not even started to realise, as David Leask observes. Our attachment to Europe is perhaps more at an emotional level and sometimes that is more than enough.Tony Fitzpatrick, Dumfries.A RISK INHERENT IN THE ASSISTED DYING BILLEILEEN McCartinmakes an excellent point about the dangers of the ‘slippery slope’ associated with legalising assisted suicide or euthanasia, as evidenced from the experiences of other countries where laws have been extended to include disabled people, children and those with mental illnesses.She states that many Liberal Democrats oppose Liam McArthur’s proposals but she is incorrect in claiming that “the current Assisted Dying Bill … in no way reflects Lib Dem policy”. Sadly, the Scottish Liberal Democrats did adopt just such a policy in , which was reaffirmed in  by the UK Liberal Democrats in a motion which made specic reference to Mr McArthur’s proposed Bill.Of course, like all previous attempts to legalise assisted suicide, Mr McArthur has failed to address the concerns that exist about how to safeguard those who are vulnerable to pressure being exerted by others with questionable motives, such as access to a potential inheritance or the desire to free up beds in hospitals or care homes.For example, most of those gaining assistance from doctors to commit suicide in Oregon now regularly cite the “fear of being a burden on family, friends or caregivers” as their reason for seeking death.The bill would provide a cheap solution for policy-makers or NHS managers, enabling them to sidestep their obligations to address the unmet need for palliative care. It would make the situation worse.The experience of those countries which have gone down the assisted suicide or euthanasia route shows that the development of palliative care is impeded when such legislation is in place.Faced with shortages of NHS resources, an overstretched workforce due to the pandemic and the prospect of huge savings to be made by enabling patients to end their lives prematurely, can we really trust politicians to come up with a law containing adequate safeguards which will prevent abuses from occurring Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO, Care Not Killing, Glasgow.THE ABORTION CONUNDRUMI HAVE never understood why abortion has not been brought in to the discussion about assisted dying.It is perfectly legal to end a le that has not been lived , whereas people who have lived what they describe as a happy and full le and now wish to end it, either because of, or ahead of, intolerable, unmanageable pain, are unable to make this decision for themselves.Why is it permissible to end one unlived le but not another fully lived le Kathleen Gorrie, Helensburgh.NOT ALL SUFFERING CAN BE RELIEVEDI AM a retired doctor, and a Catholic opposed to assisted dying legislation.Like Lilian McDade , I have watched my -year-old son die. I have witnessed the suffering of patients, of their family and friends, and also within my own family. I don’t believe we can relieve all suffering, either physical or mental.However, I dfer from your previous correspondents. As a doctor, I felt my role was to relieve suffering where I could and to acknowledge and respect the patient and her family when I was unable to provide relief. As a doctor and a person, it was not my role to end her le, only to be present.Some of us have charmed lives and happy deaths, but some have dficult lives and dficult deaths.I believe a caring society acknowledges this and acts to help. Offering death, however, is not acceptable to doctors, nurses or human beings.We ought to oppose assisted dying legislation.Miriam Deeny McKernan, Rutherglen. "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-82-outlasted-two-hunterston-power-stations-meant-much","story":"Between  and  I was employed by Simon Carves as a mechanical fitter. Although I was only aged  to  at that time, I served as the lead shop steward for several hundred employees. In those far-off days, before the Labour Government under Harold Wilson introduced the Employment Protection Act of  , shop stewards were hunted down like mad dogs. As I used to say, when you are hunted down like a mad dog you become a mad dog.In due course I was paid off in mid-, way out of turn. I tried to get a position as a mechanical fitter with at the new nuclear power station, but despite my previous excellent apprenticeship practical training at the former Ardrossan Dockyard and with Simon Carves, to say nothing of very good technical qualications, I was not accepted.At my interview I was heavily questioned on my shop steward experience with Simon Carves.After further work experience between  and  at Sizewell and Dungeness A power stations, where I also served as a shop steward, I formed my own company, William McCrindle and Son Ltd, on April , , with a capital of £.Fast forward to : my company was selected to carry out the repair of one of the advanced cooled reactors at Hunterston B, following an ingress of , litres of sea water.

The reactor was ed to power in February  and operated successfully thereafter ever since.Because of my previous training as a shop steward and my excellent relationship with the local Clydeside full-time trade union organisers, the SSEB inserted a clause in my sea-water ingress contract that I could not leave the country for any more than two weeks without their permission.Changed days from  when I was not suitable to them as a mere mechanical fitter. Of course, I accepted the clause as it appealed to my ego. At , I am still in business as a property developer, so I have outlasted the working le of the two power stations at Hunterston which meant so much to me and my career .WR McCrindle MBE, Chairman, McCrindle Group Ltd, West Kilbride.  AN EYE-OPENING ENCOUNTER AT THE KELVIN HALLREADING Susan Swarbrick’s article on Saturday, then Gordon Fisher’s reminiscencesbrought to mind my own Kelvin Hall experiences.In , as an apprentice painter and decorator, I was working on preparation for the Ideal Homes Show and my boss Mr Harrison, of Samuel Craig  Co, put me to wallpapering a showhouse.This caused great upset amongst all tradesmen in the hall, who thought it inappropriate for a first-year apprentice to be wallpapering and therefore, in their opinion, “taking a job away from a tradesman”.A union meeting was held and Mr Harrison defended his position by stating that this was a legitimate part of my training. Common sense prevailed, a vote was taken, and it was back to the paste table for me.Coincidentally, at the same event one of our tradesmen, Matt Byrne, decided to make use of the bathroom in a showhouse since he lived in a single end and had no bath or shower.So it was something of a shock to the two police officers who were completing a search of the house, prior to it being visited by Princess Margaret, to find Matt towelling himself down with a clean dust sheet!Brendan J Keenan, Glasgow.  THE HERALDS TIE-UP WITH THE NEW YORK TIMESIT is absolutely fantastic to see the Herald’s partnership with the New York Times.Something that Scottish newspapers have cut back on in recent years, andsuffered from, is a lack of international news coverage and opinion.The one standout has been the Herald’s David Pratt, but he has often seemed like a lone voice, and cannot realistically be expected to provide first-hand accounts from dferent parts of the world at the same time.The partnership with the New York Times enables a much wider depth and breadth of international opinion and coverage. Indeed, as well as subscribing to the Herald, I subscribe to the New York Time’s online site to obtain international news, and it is great to now see a partnership between my two favourite newspapers.Reading Saturday’s edition of the Herald was a wonderful experience, with thoughtful coverage from around the world, as well as excellent coverage from across Scotland. Long may your partnership with the New York Times continue.Peter Clark, Tornagrain, Inverness. A NATIONAL CONVENTION  NOT SO FASTIN setting out her grand design for the people of Scotland, Maggie Chetty letters, January  seems to have forgotten a few things.The first is that the agreement of both of Scotland’s parliaments of a Section  Order In Council to transfer the powers to hold a referendum on independence is not a “doomed idea” but a legal requirement.It was put into legislation with the full support of Scottish MPs and was not contested either before the  referendum or by the Smith Commission, which was happily endorsed by all of the Holyrood parties.But most of all she seems to have forgotten that the majority of us don’t want independence. Indeed, Ms Chetty is like one of the former communist dictators of the Warsaw Pact in ignoring the will of the people while purporting to be their tribune.She has clearly lost confidence in the Scottish people: to paraphrase Bertolt Brecht in , maybe she is seeking to dissolve it and hoping to find another one.Peter A Russell, Jordanhill, Glasgow.I THOUGHT Ms Chetty’s idealistic plan had some things to commend it, but does anyone think for one moment that our politicians and their more outspoken followers would be able to put aside their lelong mutual antipathies and work together for the common good Sooner or later, most coalitions break up amidst acrimony or, at the very least, frustration and inertia.M.

The rest of the six were Starling, HSBC and the The Co-Operative Bank.The research found that TSB, Bank of Scotland owners Lloyds, , Nationwide, Santander and The Co-operative Bank also all still use SMS texts to very a log in, leaving messages \"at risk of being hijacked by cybercriminals\". Santander and The Co-operative Bank said they are looking to move away from SMS.They also found that TSB, Virgin Money and Nationwide were failing to use software that ensures spoof messages sent by potential scammers are blocked or quarantined by your email provider. TSB has said it has since introduced this protection, Virgin Money said it was in the works and Nationwide said it operates ‘a range of email security controls’ to protect members.HSBC came out on top for securitiy, with a score of  per cent. It was the only bank to score five stars for both website encryption and account management. It was rated A+ for cipher strength because it supports the latest encryption standards.In a test of each provider’s banking app Virgin Money and TSB again were were amongst the lowest ranked.Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, and TSB dropped points because online and mobile banking require the same login credentials - with the consumer organisation saying it would prefer banks to ask for app-specic passcodes.Which said: \"While online banking is a largely safe way to manage money, scammers are upping their game and the industry needs to keep pace.\"That is why we are calling for banks to work much harder to upgrade online security so they are providing high levels of protection for customers.\"If a fraudster does breach a bank’s defences and you lost money as a result, you have a legal right to a refund from your bank – unless it can demonstrate that you were ‘grossly negligent’ – in other words, unusually careless with your security details.\"Last year TSB was reported to the finance regulator for failing to comply with the rules over online banking security .Concerns were raised with the Financial Conduct Authorityabout Edinburgh-based TSBs online banking login process as it joined Edinburgh-based Tesco Bank as the worst in the UK in a probe into flaws in online banking security that could help criminals to scam customers.Jenny Ross, Which money editor said: “Banks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed worrying flaws when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.“Our research reinforces the need for banks to up their game on tackling fraud by using the latest protections for their websites and not allowing customers to set insecure passwords. We also want banks to stop sending sensitive data to customers via SMS texts as this could leave the door open to fraudsters.”A TSB spokesman said: “We continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers and have introduced a number of features recently which aren’t captured in these results. Additionally, TSB tracks well across the industry on fraud with lower than average fraud losses. In contrast to the wider industry, we are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund our customers should they ever fall victim to bank fraud.”A Virgin Money spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our banking services is our top priority and we are continually monitoring, assessing and improving our security controls.”A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: “Keeping our customers’ money and data safe is our priority and we have robust, multi-layered security across online and mobile banking services to protect against cyber security threats. We employ world-class experts in the cyber-security field, who work to deliver the right balance of online security measures, customer experience and accessibility. We continuously evolve and invest in our safeguards and have fully decommissioned the legacy Lloyds Bank sub-domain referenced.”A NatWest Group spokesman added: “Security continues to be a high priority for NatWest Group to keep our customers and the bank safe. We continue to invest in our digital security capabilities, leveraging market leading technologies – for example, multi-factor authentication and our work on biometrics – to deliver simple and secure banking services for our customers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"next-celtic-connections","story":"Roaming Roots, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Dean Owen at CCA, January Geraint Watkins Band and Emma Jane, Drygate Brewery, January Shetland , The Mackintosh Church, January Ceilidh With The Peter Wood Band, National Piping Centre, January The Lonesome Ace Stringband  The Magpies, Mitchell Theatre, January Elephant Sessions th Anniversary Special, Glasgow Barrowland, January  The Conundrum: International Piping Night, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Neal Francis and Unoma Okudo, Drygate Brewery, January An Tobar:  Years, Drygate Brewery, January Megan Henderson with Ainsley Hamill: Not Just Ship Land, Mitchell Theatre, January Frankie Gavin and Màirtìn Ò Connor and Stundom, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Le Vent Du Nord, Old Fruitmarket, January Ian Fraser with Josie Duncan, Mitchell Theatre, January Spiers  Boden, Òran Mór, January Astrid and Ewan Macfarlane, Drygate Brewery, January Lera Lynn and Donovan Woods, CCA, January Allison Russell and Ala de Liona and Emily Scott Robinson, Saint Luke’s, January Breabach with Beòlach, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Jason Wilson’s Ashara, CCA, January Leventime: A Tribute To Jackie Leven, Òran Mór, January Stina Marie Claire, CCA, January Andrew Wasylyk and Twelfth Day, Mitchell Theatre, January Hamish Henderson Night: Ballad Of The Banffies, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Jill Jackson and Lady Nade, Old Fruitmarket, January Annabelle Chvostek and Elaine Lennon, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Kate Rusby, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Rachel Baiman and Cahalen Morrison, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , February Catriona Price, Mitchell Theatre, February Amadou  Mariam, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Darlingside, Saint Luke’s, February Dervish, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Tom Oakes, National Piping Centre, February The Mastersons and Julia Taylor, CCA, February Ryan Young and Chris Amer with Janice Burns and Jon Doran, National Piping Centre, February Roddy Hart And The Lonesome Fire, Saint Luke’s, February "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmRestrictions on indoor hospitality which were introduced on Boxing Day are to remain in place until at least January , Scotland#s First Minister has confirmed.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Tommy’s was him working to get back to make a try-saving tackle. There was a big dference between the two.“I’ve apologised to the boys for letting them down, I’ve apologised to Steve.“It’s something I can’t promise I won’t do again, but it is one of those, you lose your head in the heat of the moment.“I haven’t got a bad discipline record. I’ve never been red-carded in the professional game. I think I’ve got about four yellows in my professional career, so I guess that answers all your questions around that.“For some reason I’ve got this weird perception that I’ve got bad discipline, I get peppered online about it. It goes in one ear and out the other. I feel like I probably let myself down.“I am usually the one getting the reaction, as opposed to giving a reaction. It’s a learning lesson for me, being on the other side of the coin where I’ve lost my head in a split second. vw,vw,px, px\"Wasps player Francois Hougaard “I’ve seen a lot of people saying I tried gouging him , which is absolutely ridiculous. I would never even dream of doing something like that. It’s disgusting.“I lost my head, I pushed him in the face a little bit, I will learn from it. I’ve said sorry to the boys, I said sorry to Steve, and we move on.”Borthwick appointed Genge to the role of skipper this season and he has played a pivotal role in helping Leicester reach the league campaign’s halfway stage with an eight-point lead at the Premiership summit.Tigers also won their first two Heineken Champions Cup games last month and they appear well on course for a place in the tournament’s knockout phase. vw,vw,px, px\"Leicester head coach Steve Borthwick Borthwick said: “Heis brilliant to be able to connect people – whether you are an -year-old coming out of the academy to someone with -plus caps, he can connect everyone together.“If you’ve got someone who works hard, is brilliant with people and playing really well, he’s an incredibly powerful leader.“From my point of view, the time I have worked with Ellis, he is terric.“He thinks calmly and is able to give clear instructions. He has grown to be a top-class international player.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As our galaxy is getting older, it is getting fatter.”Prof Li and an international team embarked on the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Surveyto measure the properties of stellar streams.As part of the study, they looked at the speeds of stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope , an optical telescope in Australia.Co-author, Professor Daniel Zucker of Macquarie University in Sydney, said that unlike previous studies that have focused on one stream at a time, “S is dedicated to measuring as many streams as possible, which we can do very efficiently with the unique capabilities of the AAT”.The properties of stellar streams helps reveal the presence of the invisible dark matter of the Milky Way.Professor Geraint Lewis, of the University of Sydney, also a co-author, said: “Think of a Christmas tree.“On a dark night, we see the Christmas lights, but not the tree they are wrapped around. But the shape of the lights reveals the shape of the tree.“It is the same with stellar streams – their orbits reveal the dark matter.”As well as measuring speeds, the astronomers can use these observations to work out the chemical compositions of the stars to get clues as to when they were born.The team now plans to produce more measurements on stellar streams in the Milky Way.The study will be published in the American Astronomical Society’s Astrophysical Journal.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641566695558.jpg--covid_19___fri_7th_january_figures.jpg?1641566695000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220107newscovid 19 fri 7th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows no further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

What we are seeing now is patients presenting with a sore or scratchy feeling throat, mild headache, sneezing and a runny nose.“We are not seeing as many people – either adults or children – experiencing high temperatures or fever. For the most case, these symptoms can be managed at home with a mix of paracetamol or ibuprofen, basically over-the-counter medicine you can get from a pharmacist.”Read MoreWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean The transmissibility of Omicron has prompted the government to change testing and isolation guidelines.As of January , people in Northern Ireland who get a positive lateral flow test no longer need a PCR test to confirm that result.In the event of a positive lateral flow test, the public has been advised to assume they have Covid and that you are infectious and report it on the gov.uk website.The earliest a period of self-isolation can end is on day seven - providing lateral flow tests on day six and seven are both negative and the inidual does not have a high temperature.Day six and day seven lateral flow tests should be at least  hours apart. If either is positive, isolation should continue until two negative lateral flow tests taken  hours apart are achieved, or after the inidual has completed  full days of isolation – whichever is earlier.Read MoreNI public advised to self-isolate after positive lateral flow test as confirmatory PCR no longer neededAnyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable and particularly immunocompromised, they should still get a polymerase chain reaction , also known as a laboratory test, even with a positive lateral flow test , to ensure that they are then offered the potential for additional treatment as soon as possible, in order to prevent more serious illness, Dr Stout explained.He continued: “For anyone who doesn’t have an underlying condition, what they need to look out for in terms of getting worse would be shortness of breath, a tight feeling in their chest where they are unable to draw a deep breath in.“Many people have also bought pulse-oximeters which measure the level of oxygen in the blood. They are maybe not as accurate as the ones in hospital butyou do have one and your reading drops below % then it might be time to think about getting further help.“We are still contacted by patients seeking help and reassurance when they test positive for Covid.

I can’t wait.“Usually they have an open pits day, where you can walk around, bring your kids and meet the riders, so I get to do that. I’m looking forward to it.“And, sure, where  could you look for a better place to be than the north coast  It is just gorgeous. We’ve a lot to offer.”Her brother Damian also owns Morelli’s main ice-cream shop, which was established on Portstewart promenade over a century ago.

New research recently published by the Belfastrevealed that householders in Northern Ireland face hikes of up to £ in energy bills this year.That means many people could struggle with the soaring cost of running a home in .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Aodhan O’Donnell, founder of Power to Switch, which provides independent research into Northern Ireland’s energy prices, said consumers should hit the off switch where possible.“The cost of using home appliances can soon add up,” he said.“What might not seem like much over the course of a day can quickly add up over a week, month or year.“So be aware how much energy you use in the home and make sure to turn off appliances when not needed.”To help consumers with expenditure, we’ve taken a look at the running costs of some common household appliances, based on Power NI’s standard rate of .p per kWh.Our calculations found that the oven and rings, costing £. per hour, is most expensive to use.Next up, a kettle has an hourly running cost of p, followed by an iron at p, tumble dryer at p, and then a dishwasher at p.A washing machine will set you back p an hour, with a toaster costing p and a microwave p.Using one cooker ring costs p an hour, while the cost of a fridge freezer is just p – or p a day.Meanwhile, the cost of charging a mobile phone is £.p for two hours, or around £. a year, according to Mr O’Donnell.The Power to Switch director also said small things, like boiling just enough water for one cup, could make a big dference to bills.“Just by filling the kettle correctly could save £ off the annual electricity cost, think of that next time filling up for a cuppa,” he added.A table on the Northern Ireland Consumer Council’s website helps calculate the running costs of appliances using dferent tarf rates.It points out that electrical appliances – such as televisions, computers and cooker clocks – use electricity even when they’re on standby.The approximate annual cost of a TV on standby is £., while a PCwill set you back £..A cooker clock costs £. a year, and a broadband modem comes in at around £..By switching these four appliances off at the wall, householders could save up to £. a year, based on Power NI’s standard rate tarf.Peter McClenaghan of the Northern Ireland Consumer Council said your oven, tumble dryer, dishwasher and kettle “typically use most energy”.“Some households are very good at using these appliances efficiently,” Mr McClenaghan said.“For example, switching off appliances at the wall instead of leaving them on stand-by could save £ per year reducing your washing machine temperature to C can save around £ a year turning down the thermostat by just C could reduce your energy bill by £ per year.”Most ReadRepublican ex-inmates body run by former IRA man applied for NI centenary cashWatch: DUP’s

Anything less than that is unacceptable.”TUV leader Jim Allister said all the main unionist parties in Northern Ireland should not “take any office until there is reversion to the First Minister coming from the biggest community”.“Polls clearly show that there will be more unionists than nationalists in the next Assembly and therefore it would be undemocratic to allow a Sinn Fein First Minister,” Mr Allister added.“I repeat my proposal for a pre-election pan unionist pledge thatfaced with such a possibility no unionist will take any office until there is reversion to the First Minister coming from the biggest community. This was the original situation under the Belfast Agreement.“The symbolism of a Sinn Fein First Minister is seen as important to many, even for those who support the absurd Stormont system.”Responding, a Sinn Fein spokesperson said: “It will be for the people, and only the people, to decide who becomes First Minister in line with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.“What the public need to know is will the DUP respect the ballot box and the democratic will of the people ”The DUP has been approached for a response.Most ReadRepublican ex-inmates body run by former IRA man applied for NI centenary cashWatch: DUP’s Jim Shannon breaks down in tears during Downing Street lockdown party questionDick Strawbridge: buying dream home in France left us pennilessUUP leader slams Jim Allister after Covid query asking what precautions in place to prevent ROI citizens availing of free testing kits from NICrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £mTop VideosPlayJim Shannon breaks down in Commons as he talks about his mother-in-law dying alonePlayAngela Rayner says PM#s #absence speaks volumes# at Commons party questioningPlayVideo: World#s most powerful telescope gets shock testing in Northern IrelandLatest PoliticsWatch: DUP’s Jim Shannon breaks down in tears during Downing Street lockdown party questionPM won’t face probe by watchdog over £k revamp of Downing Street flatDomestic abuse laws sunk by collapse of Stormont would be shameful: Naomi LongDonaldson ‘pauses’ threat to bring down NI Executive to wait and seeLiz Truss acts on ProtocolCouncil chief executive Anne Donaghy takes case against employer alleging sexual, religious and political discriminationLatestRyan Libbey: Hold on tight to the people you loveOver £ an hour...that’s the cost of running some household appliancesPhilippe Coutinho completes Aston Villa loan moveRicky Gervais: We shouldn’t trust the people in chargeIn pictures: Larne and Linfield fans pack out Seaview for County Antrim Shield final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I just think that’s untenable.”Mr Mills added: “I don’t think we need an inquiry to work out whether the Prime Minister was there. He knows whether he was there or not. Just come out and say what happened.“If he was there he better try a hugely fulsome apology and seethe country will buy it but I’m not sure they will.”Earlier the leader of the Scottish Tories Douglas Ross again warned that Mr Johnson could not carry on in No he was found to have misled Parliament.He said the Prime Minister should not wait for Ms Gray’s report to say whether he was at the event on May  in .“It’s definitely going to come up at Prime Minister’s Questions tomorrow, so why not come forward, right now, and tell the public: was he at the party or not ” Mr Ross told the PA news agency.“But I’m in no doubt that any member – whether the Prime Minister or otherwise – who deliberately misleads Parliament cannot continue. They would have to resign.”Sir Charles Walker, the vice chairman of the Conservative backbench  Committee, said there was a lot of anger over what had happened and said the Prime Minister urgently needed to rebuild public trust.“I think the Prime Minister needs to spend the next six months restoring trust in No  and making some good and strong decisions. I think that is the challenge for him,” he told Channel  News.AskedMr Johnson had that long to win back support, Sir Charles said: “That is for him to decide, for the parliamentary party to decide. But I think the Prime Minister is a fighter and he’ll want to prove to his doubters that he is up to the job.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking action on voting rights.— President BidenJanuary , “I’m tired of being quiet,” he said, emphatically pounding the podium. “I will not yield. I will not flinch,” in the effort to protect democracy.Current rules require  votes to advance most legislation — a threshold that Senate Democrats cannot meet alone because they only have a - majority with Vice President Kamala Harris to break ties. Republicans unanimously oppose the voting rights measures.Not all Democrats are on board with changing the filibuster rules. Conservative West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin threw cold water on the idea on Tuesday, saying he believes any changes should be made with substantial Republican buy-in.And evenDemocrats clear the obstacles to passage of the voting rights laws, it could be too late to counter widespread voting restrictions passed in  states following former president Donald Trump’s  loss and his lies – embraced by many in the GOP – that the election was stolen through voter fraud.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Most ReadRepublican ex-inmates body run by former IRA man applied for NI centenary cashWatch: DUP’s Jim Shannon breaks down in tears during Downing Street lockdown party questionDick Strawbridge: buying dream home in France left us pennilessUUP leader slams Jim Allister after Covid query asking what precautions in place to prevent ROI citizens availing of free testing kits from NIJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fundTop VideosPlayJim Shannon breaks down in Commons as he talks about his mother-in-law dying alonePlayAngela Rayner says PM#s #absence speaks volumes# at Commons party questioningPlayVideo: World#s most powerful telescope gets shock testing in Northern IrelandLatest WorldRome church condemns funeral with swastika-draped coffin and fascist saluteTerrorism charge for suspect in South Africa parliament fireSix missing after collapse hits apartment block being built in South KoreaHalf of western Europe could be infected with Covid in next six weeks – reportKazakh leader says Russian-led troops will pull out after quelling unrestLatestSouthampton power past Brentford in front of new ownersPM’s position ‘untenable’he was at ‘bring your own booze’ partyCounty Antrim Shield final: Tomas Cosgrove the hero as Larne edge Linfield to retain trophy in thrilling Seaview deciderGardai seize , euro from vehicle in DublinBusinesses gear up for a bonanza as NW is back,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Jan Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Local councillor, Brian Tierney, has urged Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to make a decision on the long-awaited phase two of the Sub-Regional Stadia Programme. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Tierney, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the project would impact on a number of local clubs in Derry, including both Derry City FC and Institute FC The SDLP man said that Derry City  Strabane District Council and the clubs had been waiting since  for the second phase of the programme to commence and that action to ensure that both Derry City and Institute, along with the community, would see the full benefits. He has written to Minister Hargey to ask her to make a decision on the future of the funding before the end of the current Assembly mandate. Cllr Tierney said: “At my request council officers arranged a meeting between councillors and officials from the Department for Communities to discuss the possible opening of the second phase of this scheme which has been talked about since . “Funding from this scheme would help local clubs prepare for the future and bring their grounds up to a modern standard. “There are a number of stadiums that would be able to commence improvement works as soon as the funding is improved, not least phase two of the Brandywell Stadium redevelopment that was guaranteed by Sinn Feacutein over five years ago. “The council and clubs across our area have been long awaiting an announcement on the scheme and we had hoped to see progress long before this point. “I was disappointed to hear from officials that there is currently no timeframe for it to open. “I understand that a wide consultation has taken place with clubs across the North and that any movement on the scheme requires a Ministerial decision. “My party colleague Mark H Durkan has been raising this issue with Minister Hargey since Stormont was restored two years ago and she has still done nothing to make good on her party’s promise regarding this funding. “The failure to provide proper investment is holding back a number of clubs from across Derry and Strabane who have the ability to play at a higher level, but unfortunately do not have the facilities required to meet the standards for entry in higher isions. “We have seen how successful the first phase of this funding was for Derry City who have seen massive improvements at the Brandywell, but there is still outstanding work to be done. “There is also a need for improvements at Dergview in Castlederg and Institute are still searching for a permanent home after their ground was destroyed by flooding in . “We need to see Minister Hargey deliver on her partys previous commitments so that our football clubs can reach their potential and provide facilities to benefit the entire community.” The Department of Communities has been approached for comment.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Jan Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Local councillor, Brian Tierney, has urged Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to make a decision on the long-awaited phase two of the Sub-Regional Stadia Programme. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Tierney, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the project would impact on a number of local clubs in Derry, including both Derry City FC and Institute FC The SDLP man said that Derry City  Strabane District Council and the clubs had been waiting since  for the second phase of the programme to commence and that action to ensure that both Derry City and Institute, along with the community, would see the full benefits. He has written to Minister Hargey to ask her to make a decision on the future of the funding before the end of the current Assembly mandate. Cllr Tierney said: “At my request council officers arranged a meeting between councillors and officials from the Department for Communities to discuss the possible opening of the second phase of this scheme which has been talked about since . “Funding from this scheme would help local clubs prepare for the future and bring their grounds up to a modern standard. “There are a number of stadiums that would be able to commence improvement works as soon as the funding is improved, not least phase two of the Brandywell Stadium redevelopment that was guaranteed by Sinn Feacutein over five years ago. “The council and clubs across our area have been long awaiting an announcement on the scheme and we had hoped to see progress long before this point. “I was disappointed to hear from officials that there is currently no timeframe for it to open. “I understand that a wide consultation has taken place with clubs across the North and that any movement on the scheme requires a Ministerial decision. “My party colleague Mark H Durkan has been raising this issue with Minister Hargey since Stormont was restored two years ago and she has still done nothing to make good on her party’s promise regarding this funding. “The failure to provide proper investment is holding back a number of clubs from across Derry and Strabane who have the ability to play at a higher level, but unfortunately do not have the facilities required to meet the standards for entry in higher isions. “We have seen how successful the first phase of this funding was for Derry City who have seen massive improvements at the Brandywell, but there is still outstanding work to be done. “There is also a need for improvements at Dergview in Castlederg and Institute are still searching for a permanent home after their ground was destroyed by flooding in . “We need to see Minister Hargey deliver on her partys previous commitments so that our football clubs can reach their potential and provide facilities to benefit the entire community.” The Department of Communities has been approached for comment.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\"

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

He cited the recent success of Derrys GAA clubs as inspiring new Gaels to take up Gaelic Games and insisted that the Council give them every opportunity to one day hit the same heights as todays star players. Mr Delargy said: “The recent success of GAA clubs across the city has inspired a new generation of Gaels in Derry. “The success of Steelstown Brian Oacutegs Senior Mens and Ladies teams, Seaacuten Dolans and Na Magha highlights not only the growth of Gaelic Games in all areas of the city but also the ersity of disciplines. “Now is the time to build on that success. It’s time to make sure that first class facilities are in place right across our city, and to make sure that all our children have the opportunity to play Gaelic Games. “We need to see facilities put in place to allow training throughout the year. At the minute, many clubs are forced into finding indoor or floodlit venues throughout the winter and much underage training can’t take place. “I am confident that the Council and Council officers are committed to make this happen. We look forward to working with them to see the continued growth of Gaelic Games in Derry. “It is important to note that this does not exclude other sports. All pitches should be versatile and allow for a range of sports. GAA provision will enhance existing facilities and boost the physical and mental health of children throughout Derry.”In response, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said the Councils Playing Pitch Strategy highlights any deficits in provision across sporting codes and that the strategy continues to shape Councils future pitch development plan.

He cited the recent success of Derrys GAA clubs as inspiring new Gaels to take up Gaelic Games and insisted that the Council give them every opportunity to one day hit the same heights as todays star players. Mr Delargy said: “The recent success of GAA clubs across the city has inspired a new generation of Gaels in Derry. “The success of Steelstown Brian Oacutegs Senior Mens and Ladies teams, Seaacuten Dolans and Na Magha highlights not only the growth of Gaelic Games in all areas of the city but also the ersity of disciplines. “Now is the time to build on that success. It’s time to make sure that first class facilities are in place right across our city, and to make sure that all our children have the opportunity to play Gaelic Games. “We need to see facilities put in place to allow training throughout the year. At the minute, many clubs are forced into finding indoor or floodlit venues throughout the winter and much underage training can’t take place. “I am confident that the Council and Council officers are committed to make this happen. We look forward to working with them to see the continued growth of Gaelic Games in Derry. “It is important to note that this does not exclude other sports. All pitches should be versatile and allow for a range of sports. GAA provision will enhance existing facilities and boost the physical and mental health of children throughout Derry.”In response, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said the Councils Playing Pitch Strategy highlights any deficits in provision across sporting codes and that the strategy continues to shape Councils future pitch development plan. With regards to Gaelic Games, the spokesperson said it is one of the sports in which Council has begun to address the deficit in provision across the council area.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Visit Invest NI to learn more about the grant and whether you are eligible.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

However, Mr Eastwood stated Ms Truss threat was another in a series of hollow statements from British Government Ministers who the DUP had taken at their word only to be let down on matters Brexit. The Foyle MP said that meetings with senior Tories and threats to trigger Article  are like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on our crumbling health service, the crisis in our schools and the spiraling cost of living. He said: “It really is incredible that with our health service under immense strain, our schools facing a Covid crisis and households across the North facing spiraling energy costs that the DUP has refused to abandon it’s disastrous campaign of threatening the institutions of government over the Northern Ireland Protocol. “Instead of addressing the real priorities that people are concerned about – getting the surgery they need, protecting jobs in their communities, providing a warm home for their family – the DUP is once again chasing influence with Tories at Westminster who will use them when it’s convenient and then dump them just as quickly. “They haven’t learned a thing from their last ugly break up with that party. “It is like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on the urgent priorities facing us. “The only outcome to Jeffrey Donaldson’s foolish crusade is more uncertainty and chaos at a time when we just can’t afford it. “Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities. “Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs.

this year, with the worlds leading road racers reacquainting themselves with the . mile race around the Triangle area of the north coast. It will also be the first international road racing event to take place since the Covid- pandemic saw all activity halted in March . Club Chairperson Sanleigh Murray said the Coleraine and District Motor Club had been working hard behind the scenes. ‘Although the pandemic stopped the race action over the past two seasons, the management team of Coleraine and District Motor Club have been working hard to ensure the structures and support that underpin the North West  have remained in place for the day when we would be able make this announcement, he said. The event has retained the support of its two title sponsors, FonaCAB and Nicholl Oils. We are delighted to once again be title sponsors of the International North West , said FonaCABs William McCausland.

Gary Nicholl, of Nicholl Oils, praised the hard work of the organising team in getting the programme up and running again. The organising team at the NW have worked tirelessly to ensure theof the race and the positive impact that the Race Week festival will have on our local economy, he said. They have overcome hurdles that could have seen the demise of this famous race and they fully deserve the support of us as sponsors, our local council and fans. East Derry MLA Claire Sugden has welcomed theof the event to her constituency, and said it was a fantastic opportunity for the area. Visitors, locals and competitors all greatly missed the event when, due to the pandemic, it was cancelled for the previous two years,” she said. “It is Ireland’s largest outdoor sporting event, so to lose it for two years was a great shame. Now, however, fans and locals can look forward to watching the best road racersto the north coast and I’m sure it will come back bigger and better than ever. “It is an incredible spectacle that we are rightly proud of. It adds another string to the bow of an already excellent tourism package on offer on the north coast and this must be built on in order to keep people coming back. “I will be urging the Executive to provide as much support as possible so that the North West  can be maintained, promoted and ensured for many years to come.  pound, tourism fund finally given green light  A call-in had been taken on the decision after some councillors expressed concern.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

The Council approved a contact for the bridges removal and assessment, with a view to its restoration at a later date. In January , the process remains ongoing. At an Environmental Services Committee meeting in September , the Council committed to providing monthly updates on the assessment process. To date, the Council have employed two separate consultants for the assessment. The first - Dorans - disagreed with the initial assessment of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency s consultants - Mann Williams - that the bridge needed only cosmetic repairs. Mann Williams were later employed by the Council to carry out the assessment, but at a Committee meeting tonight, councillors heard how they had now relieved them of any more involvement in the assessment of the bridge. Translink have suggested they carry out their own assessment of the bridge at a cost of between pound-,, and have requested that the Council make a contribution for half of the required cost. In response to a question from Cllr Richard Holmes, council officials revealed that between pound, and pound, had been paid by the Council to initial consultants Dorans, with a further pound-, paid to Mann Williams. At a previous meeting, Cllr Adrian McQuillan made reference to previous reports showing the Council had spend around pound, on dealing with the bridge.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.   Councillors heard how the Mann Williams most recent assessment had raised concerns over the bridges structural integrity during snow or high winds, as well as potential problemsthere was overcrowding on the bridge. Despite reservations that the Council could potentially spend in the region of pound, for no reason, he proposed that Council provide the required funding to carry out the assessment. Cllr McQuillan said the saga of the bridge had gone on for quite a while, and said Council should liaise with community groups in the Castlerock area to prepare for the possibility the bridge would not be restored. Were this far now, so we have no other option but to go half-ways with Translink, he said. It is our bridge, and I think because of the historical nature of it, it is important to the people of Castlerock. I think we have to spend this money and see what the outcome is. Ive got a funny feeling I know what the outcome is. Maybe officers could open up a conversation with the community association down there. If this bridge cant go back up, and its maybe not a big  at the minute, could we discuss where we could place this bridge as a monument somewhere in Castlerock  We could maybe do a wee planting scheme with some sort of historical information about the bridge. I would rather see it over the railway, but I think we need to start to prepare for the worst. Certainly, it cant sit out and just rot to pieces and fall away, and that seems to be whats happening to it. Cllr McQuillan seconded Cllr Holmes proposal to provide half the funding for the latest assessment and the proposal was passed without objection.  Historic County Derry footbridge could end up in Garvagh museum  Analysis on the bridge will take a further  to  weeks.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

The Council approved a contact for the bridges removal and assessment, with a view to its restoration at a later date. In January , the process remains ongoing. At an Environmental Services Committee meeting in September , the Council committed to providing monthly updates on the assessment process. To date, the Council have employed two separate consultants for the assessment. The first - Dorans - disagreed with the initial assessment of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency s consultants - Mann Williams - that the bridge needed only cosmetic repairs. Mann Williams were later employed by the Council to carry out the assessment, but at a Committee meeting tonight, councillors heard how they had now relieved them of any more involvement in the assessment of the bridge. Translink have suggested they carry out their own assessment of the bridge at a cost of between pound-,, and have requested that the Council make a contribution for half of the required cost. In response to a question from Cllr Richard Holmes, council officials revealed that between pound, and pound, had been paid by the Council to initial consultants Dorans, with a further pound-, paid to Mann Williams. At a previous meeting, Cllr Adrian McQuillan made reference to previous reports showing the Council had spend around pound, on dealing with the bridge.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.   Councillors heard how the Mann Williams most recent assessment had raised concerns over the bridges structural integrity during snow or high winds, as well as potential problemsthere was overcrowding on the bridge. Despite reservations that the Council could potentially spend in the region of pound, for no reason, he proposed that Council provide the required funding to carry out the assessment. Cllr McQuillan said the saga of the bridge had gone on for quite a while, and said Council should liaise with community groups in the Castlerock area to prepare for the possibility the bridge would not be restored. Were this far now, so we have no other option but to go half-ways with Translink, he said. It is our bridge, and I think because of the historical nature of it, it is important to the people of Castlerock. I think we have to spend this money and see what the outcome is. Ive got a funny feeling I know what the outcome is. Maybe officers could open up a conversation with the community association down there. If this bridge cant go back up, and its maybe not a big  at the minute, could we discuss where we could place this bridge as a monument somewhere in Castlerock  We could maybe do a wee planting scheme with some sort of historical information about the bridge. I would rather see it over the railway, but I think we need to start to prepare for the worst. Certainly, it cant sit out and just rot to pieces and fall away, and that seems to be whats happening to it. Cllr McQuillan seconded Cllr Holmes proposal to provide half the funding for the latest assessment and the proposal was passed without objection.  Historic County Derry footbridge could end up in Garvagh museum  Analysis on the bridge will take a further  to  weeks.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view.

WHO advises against blanket travel bansDoes the virus read your passport  - WHO advises against blanket travel bansReporter: Mary McFadden Dec Email: mary.mcfadden@iconicnews.ie  addthis, The World Health Organisationis advising against blanket travel bans to prevent the spread of the newest Covid- iant, Omicron. googletag.cmd.push The Executive Director of WHOs Health Emergences Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said there are many ways to manage the risk of importation or exportation of disease without banning travel. At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

a special teacher and a special friendSpecial tribute to lelong friendTributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKanesince his death on Friday. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made.

a special teacher and a special friendSpecial tribute to lelong friendTributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKanesince his death on Friday. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made.

UPPERLANDS FC googletag.cmd.push The Strollers ed to action on Saturday following the Christmas break and recorded an impressive - home victory over neighbours Upperlands FC despite being - down at half time. The Strollers started brightly and should have had a penalty in the first few minutes when the Upperlands defender handled on the line but the referee waved play on. With  minutes gone Seanny McGroggan found himself through on goal but was wrongly judged to have been offside. A few minutes later Upperlands should have taken the lead but for a good save from Shaun McNamee in the Strollers goal. On the half hour mark Upperlands did take the lead with a great ing header from a cross at the back post giving McNamee no chance. Two minutes before half time, Upperlands should have made it - when their striker rounded the keeper but from a tight angle, he could only find the outside of the post. The referee however awarded a corner kick and Upperlands took full advantage, scoring directly from the corner kick. In the second half the Strollers switched formation and it had the desired effect as Tiarnan Flanagan pulled one back on  minutes when he intercepted the keepers kick out and stroked it into the bottom corner from outside the area. Three minutes later it was - when Flanagan scored a tap in after being set up by Conleth McGuckian who had made a great run from the right wing. Two minutes before the hour mark Tiarnan Flanagan, who was making his second debut for the club after ing from a spell at Tobermore, got his hat-trick after being put through on goal with a great ball from Conall Darragh. On  minutes Conleth McGuckian made it - after he blasted home a rebound after the Upperlands keeper had made a good save from his initial shot. Upperlands pulled a goal back in the th minute to set up a nervy last  minutes however, Marc Hutchinson made sure of the  points when he turned home a Conall Darragh corner with  minutes to go. Two minutes later Flanagan scored his th of the day, and a goal of the season contender, when he intercepted a clearance from the keeper and lobbed him from  yards. In the last few minutes Upperlands had the opportunity to grab a consolation goal when they were awarded a penalty but this was blasted over the bar to leave the final score -.  McGlade wins it in extra time for the Sky Blues  The Magherafelt side are through to the last  of the Irish Junior Cup.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Tom Heaney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Caolan McLaughlin is determined to use his loan spell at Institute to prove to Ruaidhri Higgins that he can be a part of his plans at Derry City. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old made his ‘Stute debut last Saturday and played the full  minutes in the - Irish Cup defeat to Portstewart at the Brandywell. He is likely to feature again in the away game at Ballyclare this weekend, with coach Brian Donaghey promising first team experience in his six-month loan spell. It is a chance that McLaughlin is determined to make the most of. “I think it’s a great opportunity for me to go and play games and show people what I am all about,” he said. “Hopefully then I can come back after the loan spell and see what happens I’ll be knocking on the manager’s door for a place in the team. “Last season there was talk about a loan but nothing came from it, but now I’m just eager to go out and play football and show everyone that I can play. I had a chat with Ruaidhri. We had a good meeting and he knew it was best for me and I knew it was best for me too. It was best for both parties to be honest.” McLaughlin made his Derry City debut last March away to Longford under Declan Devine and went on to make six first team appearances in all throughout the  season. He featured in big games against Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, but didn’t appear in the first team picture at any stage after May. With Higgins’ midfield options only strengthened due to recent arrivals at the club, a loan spell where became the more realistic option.  “That was all good experience for me, coming off the bench and hopefully now, with getting more experience with Institute I can go back and play more part in the games for Derry” he continued. “It was a bit frustrating , but it was a hard season at the start. Since Ruaidhri came in the standard has gone up. It’s all about biding my time at the minute and hopefully I can get the opportunity to play and hopefully I can take it. “I know the standards have gone straight through the roof with players like Patrick McEleney and Mickey Duffy coming in, and I know what Will Patching can do too, so I will be hard to get a place in the team, so hopefully with this opportunity with Institute, I can do it.” Settling in McLaughlin’s ‘Stute debut did not go as planned with an unexpected defeat to an Intermediate League opponent, but he is optimistic that with other new arrivals, things will start to pick up for the club in the coming weeks. “It was a bit of a disappointing result but it was good to get out there,” he agreed. “It was only my first game so it’s about settling into the team. The more games I play the more settled I’ll be. They are a great much of lads so hopefully we can pick up results and climb up that league. “I have known Briansince I was younger because I played in the county team with him. I can’t say a bad word about him, he’s a great manager and a great person. I had a chat on the phone for him for about  minutes and I know his aspirations for the second part of the season. It was a no-brainer to go to them to be honest. “These games that are coming up now will stand me in great stead. Coming back to Derry with that experience under my belt will be good. I need to be playing men’s football at the age I am, that will take me on and develop me as a player.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About at Foreglen Fight Night  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs.

Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

As our galaxy is getting older, it is getting fatter.”Prof Li and an international team embarked on the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Surveyto measure the properties of stellar streams.As part of the study, they looked at the speeds of stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope , an optical telescope in Australia.Co-author, Professor Daniel Zucker of Macquarie University in Sydney, said that unlike previous studies that have focused on one stream at a time, “S is dedicated to measuring as many streams as possible, which we can do very efficiently with the unique capabilities of the AAT”.The properties of stellar streams helps reveal the presence of the invisible dark matter of the Milky Way.Professor Geraint Lewis, of the University of Sydney, also a co-author, said: “Think of a Christmas tree.“On a dark night, we see the Christmas lights, but not the tree they are wrapped around. But the shape of the lights reveals the shape of the tree.“It is the same with stellar streams – their orbits reveal the dark matter.”As well as measuring speeds, the astronomers can use these observations to work out the chemical compositions of the stars to get clues as to when they were born..removeThe team now plans to produce more measurements on stellar streams in the Milky Way.The study will be published in the American Astronomical Society’s Astrophysical Journal..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Astronomers take a closer look at dark matter enveloping Milky Way article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Members were informed the council will be launching an online survey to judge where or , there is enough interest in providing the borough’s citizens with allotment space.The survey will run for a period of eight weeks and once completed, officers will provide councillors who sit on the committee with options on how best to move forward on the matter.Speaking at the meeting, Alliance Party Councillor Eoin Tennyson said he would be delightedthis process resulted in an enhancement of allotment provision in the borough.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“It is great to see the online consultation coming forward to determine what the demand is in the community,” he said.“I know allotment projects have been successful in other parts of Northern Ireland and there are good private providers here so it would be fantastic , out of this process, we could enhance our own provision or even have better partnerships with those providers in the borough.“That would be really positive for those in the borough who want to grow their own food.”Ulster Unionist Party Councillor Julie Flaherty told the chamber she believed there would be strong demand for this service.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“I suspect there will be a huge interest in these allotments,” said Cllr Flaherty.“In the centre of Portadown there is a vegetable group, the group attached to that has  members and some of them are growing at home and learning how to use what they grow.“Recycling, composting, you name it, there are over  members there in the centre of Portadown. That is a good gauge of the level of interest and we are very proud of the guys at sustain who have worked very hard over lockdown too.”Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Tennyson continued to speak highly of the proposal and noted the strong demand for allotment space in other council areas.“Community allotments can have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing, and on the local environment,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We have some fantastic allotment providers in the borough. However, there is clearly huge demand and it would be fantastic to see greater council support for existing providers and potentially even some new council-owned sites.I first raised the issue of allotment provision at committee in September. It’s fantastic to see progress on the matter. The proposed survey will be good news to many local residents who wish to grow their own food but don’t currently have access to appropriate facilities.“Information presented at committee clearly highlighted the popularity of allotments in other areas with both Antrim and Newtownabbey and Mid and East Antrim Council, with some having waiting lists of five years or more.“Once the online survey has been completed, Council will analyse the results to determinethere is demand additional allotment provision and put plans in place to meet that demand.”Craigavon Borough CouncilBanbridgeArmagh CityUlster Unionist Party  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDeal to sign Joe Gorman to Portadown FC collapses after twee...NewsFuneral arrangements for young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Ho...NewsLarne charity founder receives Points of Light award from Pr...NewsPSNI warn of Lisburn road closure...NewsWardens to increase patrols in Lurgan Park amid rise in drug...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"sugden reiterates support for portrush skatepark ","story":"Call to suspend house building at Larne West ‘until link road completed’   Tributes to young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Hoye who died suddenlyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsCouncilSugden reiterates support for Portrush skateparkEast Londonderry MLA Claire Sugden has reiterated her support for a skatepark to be built in Portrush.By Una CulkinTuesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Ms Sugden said it would be an “investment in youth” at a time when youth services were underfunded and under-resourced. A proposal to lease land at pole Park for such a facility will be considered by Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council’s Leisure and Development Committee on Tuesday .“There has been a large community of skateboard, rollerblade, scooter and BMX users in the town for decades,” Ms Sugden said. “Dferent areas around the town have been used by them over the years, but this is not ideal and can create safety issues both for them and other members of the public.“Having a dedicated space for these urban sports would enable them to thrive and create a hub where people of all ages can engage in these sports.“Young people are often scrutinised when they gather in groups in town centres. Providing a relevant focus for young people in the town would demonstrate our commitment to supporting their interests.“Many successful skateparks have been created across Northern Ireland, but not many places have the same tradition and community of urban sports as Portrush does. I have no doubt that such a park would be well used and would get young people involved in sport in a new way.”Claire SugdenPortrushCauseway CoastNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDeal to sign Joe Gorman to Portadown FC collapses after twee...NewsFuneral arrangements for young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Ho...NewsLarne charity founder receives Points of Light award from Pr...NewsPSNI warn of Lisburn road closure...NewsWardens to increase patrols in Lurgan Park amid rise in drug...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641825999968.jpg--covid_19___mon_10th_january_figures.jpg?164182600000","title":"covid  mon th january figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
