We should go into it with political ambition. So, yes, mitigate the risks but we should grasp the opportunities.\u0027One thing I get nervous about, or anxious, is that we don\u0027t cower in a corner so fixated on the risk that we look somehow afraid of our own shadow.

The designer horses are sometimes referred to as \u0027Disney\u0027 horses, because they look like animals from the cartoons (pictured) with their pulled-in noses and popping-out eyes          Miss Fowler examining a horse\u0027s mouth at work in WiganIn October last year an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face.The owners of the nine month old colt was said to resemble cartoon horses in Disney films Sleeping Beauty and Aladdin.Miss Fowler said: \u0027People seem to like these very dainty, pulled-in faces but that gives them breathing difficulties and dental problems. I\u0027m seeing these deformities on a weekly basis.\u0027One problem is there isn\u0027t enough space for their teeth because their mouths are smaller.          In October last year it emerged an Arabian show horse called El Rey Magnum (pictured) was born in the US, and left experts horrified because of its concave face          Example of extreme breeding, more usually seen in cats and dogs, can often be seen in the Arabian horse pedigree like Apalo, pictured, grandfather to El Rey Magnum\u0027As a result the teeth grow everywhere and, in some cases, they\u0027ll make a whole space of their own behind the oral cavity because they can\u0027t fit in their mouths.\u0027The x-ray from a horse I recently treated shows clearly that her teeth can\u0027t fit properly.\u0027One is sitting behind her oral cavity, another has twisted 90 degrees because it wouldn\u0027t fit.\u0027While human teeth are simple to extract, horse teeth can be anything from 8cm to 15cm long depending on the size of the horse. To extract a horse\u0027s tooth requires very big surgery.\u0027One pony I recently treated is not expected to live very long at all now and she\u0027s only six. Selective breeding can certainly decrease life expectancy.\u0027          Pedigree horses bred to have a concave face, pictured, has been described as ‘horrific’ by veterinary experts.Aside from the difficult situation of seeing their horse in pain, owners are often faced with bills reaching into the thousands due to the complexity of surgery.If surgery is needed it can be intense and \u0027massively risky\u0027 if the horse needs anaesthetic.Miss Fowler, who owns three horses herself, said: \u0027If a horse needs an operation the vet bills can be in the thousands. It is a much more serious procedure for horses than humans.\u0027Ethically vets have to decide what is best for the horse because surgery is massively invasive.\u0027Most owners decide they don\u0027t want to put their horses through it.\u0027Horses have a one in 100 chance of death from general anaesthetic, compared with humans who have a one in 100,000 chance.\u0027Any surgery is massively risky. It\u0027s very, very intense.\u0027She claims it is often a horse\u0027s failure to show pain, as it is taught in the wild, that means owners are oblivious to the level of pain or suffering they are going through.As a result, it can already be too late by the time they visit the vet.\u0027Usually the owners don\u0027t know their horses are in pain. Horses are prey animals - they don\u0027t show pain,\u0027 she said.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing how severe the problems can get before the horses show any signs of pain or weight loss.\u0027Pain is weakness in the wild and they would get eaten so often the problems are found when it is much too late to help the animal.\u0027When found early, the owners are very surprised to find their animal is in pain.\u0027The practice owner has now urged breeders to be more responsible, calling on them to consider functionality and what is best for the horse.Miss Fowler added: \u0027I think the focus needs to be on breeders as well as owners or buyers.\u0027The breeders pushing for the extreme features that are causing the health issues are certainly irresponsible.\u0027They breed for profit and create horses wanted for being pretty as opposed to functioning or healthy. That\u0027s the main source of the problem and it\u0027s definitely getting worse.\u0027But while dogs can live on a soft diet without teeth if need be, horses need to eat grass for up to 20 hours a day.\u0027People need to consider functionality and what is best for the horse. This is a massive problem in the horse world.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/11/4D83B75300000578-0-image-m-13_1529661727209.jpg","title":"Patrice Evra likened Carlton Fresh Prince bow tie","story":"    The French star\u0027s bizarre outfit choice was compared to something a fast food worker would wear by this Canadian Liverpool fans\u0027 account          The outfit was likened to this one worn by EastEnder\u0027s character Frank Butcher as he tried to romance partner Pat       \u0027Everyone\u0027s hair is still holding up well\u0027: Girlfriend\u0027s...\u0027What did I just watch?\u0027 Social media lights up after Iran...Share this articleOthers joked that he had \u0027lost a bet\u0027, with some social media users theorising that his mother had dressed him. The 37-year-old\u0027s fashion choices weren\u0027t the only aspect of his appearance to be criticised, as the pundit was slammed for \u0027manspreading\u0027 and slouching.

Kevin Clinesmith, 36, another FBI attorney who worked on the Clinton investigation, was found to have sent similar messages. Clinesmith was identified as \u0027Attorney 2\u0027 in the inspector general report, but his name was released by Rep. Mark Meadows during a congressional hearing this week.At the hearing, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz declined to confirm the identities of Moyer and Clinesmith. But Meadows said he decided to name them because neither works in a counterintelligence capacity.Clinesmith, who attended Georgetown University Law Center, previously worked for the U.S. Department of Energy before joining the FBI.In 2012, he ran for Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Columbia Heights, a northwest neighborhood in Washington, D.C., on a platform of supporting the local arts, installing more public trash bins to the area, and improving a local dog park.Clinesmith, who is orced, told the New Columbia Heights website at the time that he grew up in a \u0027small farming town in rural Michigan\u0027 and moved to the Washington area in 2008.Clinesmith texted several colleagues bemoaning the \u0027destruction of the Republic\u0027 after FBI Director James Comey wrote a letter informing congress that the Clinton email investigation was being reopened days before the election on October 26, 2016.

Both of us are travelling around the world all the time. But trust and understanding are important. He understands and supports me in everything.’But it seems that her trust was betrayed when her husband bedded a student five years her junior in 2011.          Dronsfield\u0027s wife Anna Bondareva in an advertising campaign for Police sunglasses alongside heartthrob George ClooneyNow after a four-year battle in the courts, an employment judge has ruled that the university was right to sack him because he demonstrated ‘immoral, scandalous or disgraceful behaviour incompatible with the office’.The ruling at Watford Employment Tribunal follows a long fight by the academic, who has spent a fortune in legal fees trying to win compensation. The scandal emerged in 2013 when the student’s ex-boyfriend complained to the university that Dr Dronsfield, an associate professor who was teaching art theory, had ‘multiple sexual relationships’ with students and regularly plied them with alcohol.He told the university: ‘He has been having sex with students who he is responsible for tutoring. \u0027I do not know how frequently this happens, but I do know he frequently has students come to his office for late night meetings about their dissertations which usually involve large quantities of alcohol...‘I think someone in a position of trust and authority is abusing their position on a regular basis to have sex with young girls.’ He said of his ex-girlfriend: ‘She was going through a breakdown during the full period of her degree. She was in a vulnerable place and he took advantage. He was marking her work and advising on her academic activity.’          Reading University, where Dronsfield was a professor of fine artThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed she had sex with her lecturer twice and said they often stayed up late at night in his office drinking whisky and port.Dr Dronsfield, from Clapham, South London, admitted they had sex once in a hotel after the pair exchanged links to erotic film Emmanuelle and she turned up to his office with alcohol.He was sacked for having a sexual relationship with a vulnerable student, failing to report the relationship and abuse of power leading to a conflict of interest. No evidence of a ‘predatory intent’ was found and it was concluded the affair had no impact on the student’s dissertation.A series of court hearings followed as Dr Dronsfield fought his case. The latest took place in March.Now Employment Judge Alastair Smail has ruled: ‘The dismissal was not unfair. He had a sexual relationship with a student he taught and assessed and he did not report it, in breach of the rules.‘Further, the claimant’s attitude to the sexual encounter appeared callous. He did it, he had said, to bring the intimate relationship to an end.’Miss Bondareva, who was notably absent throughout the proceedings, declined to comment on the case or her marriage when contacted by the Daily Mail. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/08/4D79276800000578-5868723-image-m-27_1529565461126.jpg","title":"Newcastles Ciaran Clark sports ugly facial scar bottled Magaluf","story":"    Newcastle United star Ciaran Clark (pictured in La Sala, Marbella) with a burst lip after he was attacked in a Magaluf nightclub   Clark (pictured) got caught up in the violence along with a friend after men started flirting with their girlfriends, according to reportsClark was allegedly confronting a group of men who were trying to flirt with his girlfriend. Bar staff told The Sun Online that Clark\u0027s girlfriend was seen shouting at a group of men from Croydon, London, who were harassing her.They say that when the Newcastle defender got involved he was struck in the face with the bottle. The Premier League star is said to have been injured after stepping in to help his friend. Initial reports were that Harrow-born Clark, who played for England up to U20 level before switching to the Republic of Ireland, had been knocked unconscious with a punch to the face.Police confirmed he had suffered a lip injury, but said they could not confirm he had been knocked out and revealed he had gone to hospital himself in a taxi while his friend was taken away by ambulance.

Designer Mrs Hindmarch received a CBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours while sitting on the economy committee.Mr Rittner, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Dance, got a CBE for services to the arts at the same time. He was a member of the arts and media committee. Dame Julia, former director of London’s Serpentine gallery, received her gong in the 2016 Birthday Honours while on the arts and media committee. And Labour MP Dame Rosie, then opposition chief whip, was honoured in the 2016 New Year’s Honours when she was sitting on the parliamentary and political service committee.Several civil servants received gongs despite being involved in the honours process. They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ...

People need it, he believes, and so do nations. Much of his fiction has reflected on the loss of an American sense of purpose, the decay of the dream much of his non-fiction has told the stories of immigrants to the US who have shown the drive and generosity missing from the country as a whole. In person, as in his work, Eggers combines an openness to describing darkness and tragedy with a faith in the essential goodness of “everyday people”. He tells me that “whenever there’s a moment when people are inspired to make the world better, I get interested. I’m super corny that way.”The most recent of Eggers’s many books is The Lifters, a magic realist tale written for eight- to 12-year-olds, in which the “adults have lost hope, lost their way, and it’s the kids who say: ‘Here’s the task, let’s get to it.’” The setting is a town that used to be proudly defined by what it manufactured, but has been gutted by sadness and loss of identity. Carousel is collapsing in on itself, with sinkholes appearing everywhere it is up to children – the “lifters” – to go underground and prop up its foundations, and those of other disconsolate places around the world.The Lifters begins with Gran, a boy new to Carousel and ignored by his classmates he runs into a brick wall just to prove he exists. The only friend he makes is the enigmatic Catalina Catalan, whom he follows into the woods and one night sees disappear into a hillside. “You went into the hill,” he said. “No I didn’t,” she said … “I saw a handle in your hand … I saw a stairway … And a huge room … It was lit up like a church”. “No it wasn’t.” When Gran eventually becomes a lifter himself, the two take a journey to a convention of tunnel-dwellers deep in the Earth’s mantle and confront a force known as “the Hollows”.Catalina was the first character in his mind, the author says. He wanted to capture her knowledge that “she is solely responsible for holding up everything above ground … I am obsessed with giving kids responsibility. We want to protect them, so we give them less and less to do, but they respond to having a task. I mean, I’m not arguing for child labour, but … ” He has talked of children as “heroes in waiting, they just want to be given the opportunity to prove it”.In saying this, Eggers is drawing on his experience with “all the kids I’ve met here”: across the road from where we are talking in San Francisco is 826 Valencia, the young writers’ centre he founded in 2002, which is fronted by a shop selling pirate supplies. He asked students at the centre, and its equivalents across the US, to read The Lifters at proof stage: “They are the purest readers, because they want to be entertained, but they will also point out errors, inconsistencies.” He took all their edits. They are also discerning, he says, grasping “the connection straight away between the Hollows and the mood of the town. Children get it at a bone level they generally know where there is pain in their house, and they speak about it candidly.”It sometimes seems as though Eggers is waging a one-man war against cynicism: both of the magazines with which he is associated, McSweeney’s and the Believer, were begun as responses to a more acerbic literary culture. Certainly, he is drawn to children’s sense of wonder, enthusiasm and fun. His mother (whose original name was McSweeney) was a “pre-school teacher … brilliant at knowing what kids really felt and liked”, and his teenage years were spent as a camp counsellor and running a sports camp: communicating to kids has been central to his life. Toph, the young brother the 21-year-old Eggers looked after following their parents’ deaths – as recounted in his career-making memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius – joined the camp when he was four. Eggers trained as an illustrator, and it has felt natural “circling back” to write the clutch of children’s books that have followed his work on the screenplay of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are. There is, he continues, “no more fun you can have than writing a pure adventure story for the reader that you were at 10”.Eggers has said that, as a child, all he ever wore were grey and brown clothes that his own parents not once went out in the evening that his father drank and, like Gran’s, was sometimes out of work: “I can remember feeling responsible for my mother’s happiness.” Also, at school, there was his “ludicrous” name: I was Ham and Eggers,” he has recalled. “Egghead, Egg Beater. Eggs was the nicest way anyone would put it.” But he draws directly on only two personal experiences in his depiction of Gran: the excruciating time he wet himself at school, wearing khakis, and tried to cover it up at lunch by spilling milk over himself and “the game the boys had in fifth grade when we’d form a circle and take turns to kick each other in the head”.A very early image Eggers had in writing The Lifters was a “sinkhole in the middle of Gran’s school”. The symbolism is obvious: “This country makes no lasting commitment to education funding is woefully inadequate.” In the book, teachers simply work around the yawning hole in their building, as in life they adapt to insufficient money and just “reschedule a few classes … this is how we run our public education system. Spit and glue and ScotchTape, and no leadership from DC.”But before the sinkholes in his imagination were the hills. “I grew up in the flattest part of the country, the midwest,” he says. “And the landscape of my imagination was … stormy, grey, bright green hills.” Walking with his own two children (Eggers is married to the writer Vendela Vida) in just this kind of landscape north of his home in the Bay Area, he used to share a fantasy: “What if you had a handle and you could open up a door that led inside the hillside?” It’s a variation of such classic secret-door children’s fiction as the Narnia books, “The Pied Piper of Hamelin” and Coraline. When a few years ago he spent time in another hilly part of the country, rust-belt Pennsylvania, with its “crooked houses on the slopes, pawn shops and empty storefronts”, the narrative of The Lifters – in which purpose overcomes sadness to restore pride and identity – took shape.Eggers has long written about the decline of US manufacturing, not least in his novel A Hologram for the King (Tom Hanks starred as the dispossessed hero Alan Clay in the film adaptation), and is careful not to situate The Lifters specifically in the age of Trump. Finishing the story during the runup to the presidential election, however, he “couldn’t help” inserting the detail that one potential leader of Carousel campaigns on an imaginary threat from outsiders (in this case, the outsiders are moose). The opposing candidate runs on a platform of more cash for parks and schools.The election of Trump is “just absolutely crushing for anyone with an optimistic view of our citizenry,” Eggers says. This is especially the case as his understanding of American values is closely bound up with immigration. “It wasn’t until I moved to California,” in the early 1990s, “that I was able to appreciate how profoundly enriched I am, and we all are, by every new arrival … Our strength comes from our welcome and our identity as a haven and a blank canvas that anyone is free to paint on. And I’m enraged and offended by anyone who makes this into a fearful place. Maybe that’s a patriotic thing … I always picture Trump hiding under a table, because he’s afraid of everything: he’s afraid of Mexicans, Muslims, he’s afraid of change. He’s a deeply fearful human who has never acted courageously in his life.”“Any time immigrants are villainised, scapegoated or threatened,” he continues, “it’s an outrage. It comes from a cowardly place. You have a privileged 72-year-old white man who is villainising families from war-torn countries who are coming here for a better life – that’s pure ignorance, and it’s irrational and not strong and not American.”The day before we talk, Eggers has been organising an event with Valentino Deng, the Sudanese “Lost Boy” who found his way to the US, and whose traumatic experiences he channelled into What Is the What, a book Barack Obama advised every one of his White House aides to read. His second interview-based book to explore how outsiders remake America, Zeitoun, is the story of a Muslim house-painter from the Syrian town of Jableh, who helped the victims of Hurricane Katrina but was arrested as a terrorist. This year, Eggers published The Monk of Mokha, about the entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali, who narrowly escaped Yemen’s civil war, fleeing in a fishing boat with two cases of coffee. The stories of Abdulrahman Zeitoun and Alkhanshali turned out to be more complicated in real life, but Eggers says he is drawn to people, such as the latter, who are “so driven by an idea, and their ability to realise it, that they attract other humans to their light”.When dwelling on America’s loss of a clear sense of identity, Eggers often refers to the cancellation of the space shuttle programme. He has always been a space enthusiast and attended the final launch in 2011, an experience he tells me he found “very painful”. “Everyone was crying,” he has said: “The shuttle was such a powerful emblem of a sense of optimism and a can-do spirit.” The space programme finds a place in both A Hologram for the King and the less accomplished Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever?“It reminds me,” he says, “of what happened to the tobacco companies, which I covered as a journalist in the 1990s, where after a point nobody believed anything they said. If you smoked, you knew exactly what you were getting into – all the risks. You knew the companies were evil, but you did it because you were addicted. Well, people are addicted to social media. They know the companies are voraciously profit-driven and completely uninterested in privacy or any rights of the inidual. But they carry on using the tools because their friends are using them and there’s nothing better.“Facebook is still Facebook. It went through a little dip how many people deleted their accounts? People have a high tolerance for being surveilled. I think it will have to get even more poisonous and destructive before there’s a real change. Social media separates and isolates us … Any time you’re next to an actual human … you can find common ground. Humans in person are kind and giving and generous. But online, you see an inversion of every good quality … We are at our best in person.”The response of Eggers, who remains an untiring and inspiring literary activist, is to focus on personal stories. He mentions a young Ethiopian-American girl he has just encountered at one of the tutoring centres: “Any time you’re cynical about the world, meet a first-generation kid who writes about what she’s grateful for.” He admits he has found the last couple of years “crushing to a point when I do wake up paralysed sometimes” – and his next novel is “incredibly dark” he has been wading through “terrible footage and files”. But writing children’s stories has helped. Plus his belief in inidual drive and purpose is unwavering. “On this block,” he says, “I could introduce you to nine people whose stories would make interesting books … If you’re listening, the stories are never-ending” •• The Lifters is published by Scholastic.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e994c6b4aced4b04e880aa4bbc6c8686b8a259/0_108_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abfa598e65617fadd7e44a08aab7a6f6","title":"bourbon levis prices rise eu enforces tariffs us","story":"Bourbon whiskey, Levi’s and Harley-Davidson on list as EU measures comes into forceDonald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi’s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Trump’s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by £200m per year in the UK alone.Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US.Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler.The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism.The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods – designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support – were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to €2.8bn (£2.5bn).The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged “unfair” trading practices.The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the “unilateral and unjustified decision of the US”. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers.Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add £200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about £406bn on retail purchases.“Though the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it’s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,” he said.Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them.European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. “If we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it’s because there are alternatives on the market. We don’t want to do anything that would harm consumers,” he said. “What’s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaeccdb42df5a44306ad7452b24d18a1109f105c/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a971f9f94887047da712c39217f5f015","title":"oil output set to rise by 1m barrels a day in opec deal saudi energy minister","story":"Major oil producers have agreed to pump more crude to help reduce prices and prevent a supply shortage, in a significant reversal of Opec’s strategy of curbing output over the past 18 months.After a fraught meeting in Vienna in which Iran was initially at odds with a Saudi-led drive to boost production, ministers settled on a target they said would increase output by around 1m barrels per day (bpd).Donald Trump, who has blamed the cartel for recent oil price highs, appeared to welcome the deal. “Hope Opec will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!” the US president tweeted after the agreement.However, analysts and ministers said the actual amount of extra oil is likely to be around a third lower than the headline 1m figure.The oil cartel also failed to spell out how the extra production would be allocated among members, a key question as several have no capacity to pump more crude.Friday’s deal centres on how closely countries have stuck to production cuts that have been in effect since the start of 2017, driving a recovery in oil prices.Roger Diwan, a veteran Opec observer and analyst at IHS Markit, said: “That’s a fudge for sure.”He said the agreement paved the way for the Saudis to pump more, while the Iranians could sell the deal domestically by saying they had blocked a bigger increase.Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the kingdom was ready to increase production.“Saudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,” he said. However, he said the impact of the increase would not be felt until the end of summer, because crude would take weeks to reach markets.The minister acknowledged that not all of the cartel’s members were in a position to increase output.Crisis-hit Venezuela has suffered a nosee in production, while Iran’s exports are due to be hit by US sanctions, so neither are in a position to increase supplies.Iran failed in its effort to shoehorn a coded criticism of the US into the Opec communique.Suhail al-Mazroui, the UAE energy minister and meeting’s president, suggested the agreement represented a good compromise.After nearly two years of relative unity at Opec as the group cut production to rebalance supply and demand, the talks in Vienna this week found the cartel ided.After arriving on Tuesday, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh threatened to veto any agreement to raise output, though he eventually reached agreement with his Saudi counterpart on Friday. Observers had said earlier in the week that, “the body language has been awful”.The Ecuadorean oil minister, Carlos Pérez, when asked if the talks had been fractious, said: “It’s been a difficult situation.” But he added the cartel hoped to continue its unity despite the disagreements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef466f132d79cc5354f26880d6d458633f8423cf/0_33_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ffe7247290a7c7570e7aea240f577f","title":"airbus brexit britain commonwealth plane wings north wales","story":"Forget Brexiteer fantasies: where in the Commonwealth will Liam Fox find buyers for plane wings made in north Wales? • Airbus plans UK job cuts amid fears of hard BrexitA few days ago, I wrote about how big businesses were no longer just frustrated with Theresa May and her Brexit bumblings. Instead, they were turning hostile. “Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.”Today’s announcement from Airbus is just the first of those body blows to the British economy. The aeroplane-making giant has said in public what it has been telling ministers and officials in private for months: if May’s government crashes out of the EU without a deal, it will be forced to “reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and its dependency on the UK”. Even an “orderly” Brexit, with all ducks in a carefully negotiated row, will cost the multinational billions in red tape and slower operations.At Broughton in north Wales, they’ve been making planes since world war two. Under Airbus, that plant teems with 6,000 staff, in an area that 40 years ago was pretty much stripped of its steel industry. If it loses that giant factory, the local economy will be back on the floor for decades.Some will doubtless point out the irony of the leave voters of north Wales now paying for their votes with their jobs. That is to ignore how many Airbus workers will be commuting into Broughton from around Liverpool. The potential ripples of this will spread far and wide, and they will last.After Margaret Thatcher delivered the mortal blow to British industry in the 1980s, she devastated those communities – and helped sow the seeds of the Brexit vote of 2016. We are once again back at the stage where decisions made in smart offices by company executives threaten economic and social collapse in areas that can still remember their last great economic disaster – and once again the political consequences are likely to remain with us for a long time to come.Of course, the government knows all this, because it produced an analysis of Brexit’s impact on aerospace as one of its 39 secret reports. These were the ones that were only made public after weeks of wrangling and published just days before Christmas.I went back this morning and looked at what clues the report contained for the fallout for Britain’s aviation industry. Aircraft, it solemnly declares, have “nose, fuselage, wings … and tail”. I looked up mention of Airbus. Like Boeing, the report says, Airbus has “the capability to design and manufacture large, civil passenger aircraft”. In other words, the aeroplane-maker makes planes. And so it rambles on for 19 pages. To call it a Wikipedia rip-off would be too kind, since the online encyclopedia costs the taxpayer nothing. Yet it’s what you might expect from a government that has always treated Brexit as more a matter of internal party discipline and less a real-world event with an actual hard deadline.This is not purely a Brexit story. It is also a reflection of the weakness of Britain’s economic model.What the Airbus story reveals again is that our political classes – from Holyrood to Westminster to Cardiff Bay – have made themselves supplicants for foreign investment. The result is that among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK comes second only to Ireland in its reliance on foreign-direct investment. Just like Dublin and its sweetheart deals for the likes of Apple, we have bribed our way into that position.Even while George Osborne was hacking back benefits for the working poor, he also brought down corporation tax to among the lowest in the world. The rationale was that this would make Britain more “competitive” and boost investment. Yet that policy was described this morning by his former adviser Lord Jim O’Neill as a comprehensive failure: “Investment spending has been very weak absolutely and relatively to many other countries. Despite this remarkable drop in ongoing corporation tax and rising profitability … it’s not done the job it’s supposed to do.”Not only that, we have handed billions to companies in order to get them to set up base here. Look at the Corporate Welfare Watch database, set up by Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York, and you can see that the Welsh government handed Airbus nearly £15m in direct grants between 2004 and 2007.Like Mexico, we are effectively a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world: we import components from other countries, then ships off parts to the continent or China or the US for them to be made into whole products. Trade secretary Liam Fox can jaw on about striking new trade deals, but he’ll be waiting a long time to find a buyer in Wellington or Canberra for the plane wings made in Broughton. And Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour can fret over not hurting the feelings of its leave-voting constituents, but it would be better off developing an industrial strategy that privileged local businesses and the everyday economy.Brexit Britain is a precarious business model coupled with throwback fantasies about buccaneering our way around the Commonwealth. It makes us easy prey for the likes of Airbus, which although profitable in this country has been exploring its options in Korea and elsewhere for a long time. Why would a European plane-maker cut jobs in France or Germany when it needs EU support against Donald Trump and Boeing? Far easier to cut back in Britain, with its cabinet at war, its economy drifting away from the European mainland, and its jar of corporate sweeties already heavily raided. In lots of other industries, lots of other companies will soon be arriving at the same conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19846b4f14649195dad49166452f0805fcd081df/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe366e2f2cd9e06bab2d5cfd81e668fa","title":"the guardian view of philip hammond and airbus stand tall for jobs","story":"Two years ago this week, Britain voted to leave the EU. One year ago, the chancellor of the exchequer’s annual Mansion House speech was cancelled because of the fire at Grenfell Tower. On Thursday, Philip Hammond went ahead with this year’s speech to the City. And it was almost as if Mr Hammond had mistakenly brought along the kind of speech he might have given 12 months ago, when the Brexit process was in its infancy. But Brexit is not in its infancy. It is approaching the point of no return.True, Brexit was inescapably central to the chancellor’s prudent case this week. But the content of his speech was of an almost wholly general kind: he wanted a good deal, to protect markets from uncertainty, to uphold low friction borders and open markets, to construct an enduring partnership that recognises that Europe is Britain’s most important trading partner. He could – and would – have said all of this in 2017.But Brexit is only nine months away. Companies need to make decisions that cannot be put off while Brexiter ministers posture. More is needed from the chancellor if the generalities of his soft Brexit case are to be translated into specific and effective agreements around which the government and parliament can unite if EU exit goes ahead next year. Time is very short. It is no longer enough to talk so laconically, as Mr Hammond did, about\u0026nbspmixtures of view and active debates.Brexit is not some civilised and agreeable postgraduate seminar. It is a battle for the livelihoods and life chances of a nation and its people. If the chancellor is right that Brexit is his most immediate priority then he needs to give a lead on it. Even in a ided government like this, a chancellor has to stand tall for the British economy, for British business and for British jobs. Mr Hammond did not do that on Thursday.Then the alarm went off. The sagging disjunction between the chancellor’s speech and the real world was exposed the following morning when Airbus confirmed that it is set to pull investment from Britain after losing patience with the indolent progress in the Brexit talks. If Airbus takes the aircraft wings that it currently constructs in north-east Wales and other UK centres and moves production of them to China, the US or elsewhere in Europe, the effects will be profound. Like several other large UK companies, Airbus has been saying these things in private to government for weeks. But government seems all but paralysed over Brexit and Theresa May is not someone who likes to lead from the front.It was right that Airbus went public. The company employs 14,000 people in Britain and supports a further 100,000 UK jobs in its supply lines. The effect of a relocation on livelihoods, skills, capacity and the national and local economies would be devastating. The jobs would not come back. The effect on wider confidence would be dire. Now it is time for others to go public with their own dilemmas too. It is the only way in which pro-leave ministers, who are shockingly indifferent and reckless about these dangers, can be forced to back a less damaging approach.This is a pivotal moment not just for Britain but for the Conservative party. The party can choose an ideological course or a pragmatic one. The ideological route involves no deal with the EU, a fantasy future in a Trump-dominated Anglosphere, and a low-tax economy marked by growing inequality between a small number of very rich people and a growing mass of the low-paid working and middle class. The pragmatic route involves a soft Brexit (ideally no Brexit at all), cooperation with Europe, the easing of austerity (figures this week showed borrowing at its lowest level compared to GDP since 2001-02) and a growth strategy to support a more progressive tax regime and efficient public services.Everything in this is connected. Only the pragmatic route supports industry, steady jobs and an economy and tax base that can pay for the needs of an ageing society in health and social care. At the start of this week, Mrs May committed to spend an extra £20bn on the NHS. It was the right call. But her decision was condemned as “disgusting” by Margaret Thatcher’s biographer. That says it all. The choice could not be clearer – and it is time the government took it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88adf6c63feb9695ad46c04a9b5066e342f40f0/0_2134_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3794a469e653622bb77747379e88ce","title":"the guardian view on mobile phones schools are better without them","story":"When a minister in this government stumbles on a policy that is both popular and good, it’s newsworthy. Matt Hancock, the digital minister, has suggested that schools ban the use of mobile phones by their pupils. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, agrees. In France, the Macron government has put forward legislation that will ban the use of phones in all primary and middle schools. This removes the matter from the discretion of headteachers. Those who have already purged their playgrounds of screens report few problems. The measure seems entirely straightforward and sensible.The most serious, though, is that the constant interruption and the state of twitchy half-attention promoted by the mobile phone tends to degrade the capacity for sustained attention, which schools need to teach. There is evidence, mentioned by Mr\u0026nbspHancock, that the mere presence of a phone makes it harder to concentrate, even when it is concealed in a bag or container. The expectation of distraction is its own distraction. This isn’t just a matter of listening in lessons. Outside the classroom children are constantly learning – and teaching – important social lessons and they need to do this with their real companions rather than imaginary ones. Real communities are made from people who might not have chosen one another and schools should teach children how to live in them. Paying the tribute of attention to the people around us is part of that.Yet there are practical difficulties with the idea of a national ban on the French model. It would not be reasonable to expect children not to bring their phones to school at all, when so much social life and practical interaction with parents is coordinated with them. If the phones are stored at school that raises security questions about where they are kept. What would be the sanctions for repeat offenders? These are questions for inidual schools and headteachers to decide. If\u0026nbspMr Hancock and Ms Spielman are serious, they should be lobbying for financial support for the schools that must carry out their policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff868f67cb900f75d9f1535994ce721320e64ae1/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=da5976e777275ec2a2632c486b6ab65c 960w","title":"gallianos first couture menswear show for margiela","story":"The designer went big on cowboy boots, tweed blazers and the spirit of Humphrey Bogart for a Paris show that addressed gender stereotypes Paris Fashion Week has become a week of firsts. Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton yesterday, Kim Jones at Dior Homme tomorrow and, in the middle of them, John Galliano’s first couture menswear show for Maison Margiela.Galliano doesn’t call it couture – speaking in a new Margiela podcast, released as the show started, he calls it “artisanal”. “We are trying to define what artisanal means for us,” he said. “It’s rooted in craftsmanship and is the highest form of dressmaking, but for men. Its backbone is in tailoring, but we are trying to further explore the bias cut.”The bias cut has been central to Galliano’s womenswear aesthetic since the mid-1980s and is something he has used in former roles at Givenchy, Christian Dior and his own-name label. It is not, however, often found in menswear. For those who don’t know what a bias cut is, Galliano went on to explain on the podcast. “If you had a napkin at home and you hold it like a square, and you pull the left and right sides simultaneously, that’s what is called straight of grain. Now turn that around to a diamond and pull the opposite corners – when you pull you will see what happens. There’s a natural elasticity in the fabric and that’s when you hit the true bias.”For this springsummer 2019 collection, which was staged at Margiela’s atelier in Paris, Galliano gave himself the task of cutting the bias not from his usual silk-backed crepe, like he would for women, but from English tweeds more in line with Savile Row suiting. They came in sculpted blazers, sweeping coats and satin suits. “It’s a never-ending learning process with the bias, because each fabric reacts differently … a dialogue develops and you have to be attentive because it’s alive,” he said. “It teaches you, you can’t read about it from a book … you are not forcing it to do anything, it tells you what to do.”Embroidered kimono jackets, long red plastic macs, bejewelled corsets and acidic vinyl trousers were noteworthy pieces from the rest of the collection, as was the cowboy boot, which was present in his collections for autumnwinter 2018 too.Galliano also revealed on that podcast that he works with his year-long student placements to put the looks together. “Their view of the world is completely different,” he said. “Of course, one understands it, but you can’t put yourself in those shoes, can you? You can only be alive around these people. As much as they are obsessed with what I do, I am obsessed with what they are thinking, so it’s an ongoing exchange.”Galliano intended to address gender stereotypes with this collection, to show that cutting skills could help “discover a new sensuality, a new sexuality”. He also revealed that he intended to show his womenswear and menswear collections together as of October. The 34 looks shown today were versions of ready-to-wear pieces that will be shown in three months’ time.Combining womenswear and menswear, Galliano explaining himself on the podcast and opening the doors to the brand’s atelier (so attendees could see the in-house designers working away as they entered), it all signalled an evolution for the notoriously anonymous brand and very private designer its deconstructed aesthetic code now infiltrates its processes too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e8cafa383aa426facb4f7a37f40be50053fe0a/2_74_4436_2662/master/4436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b713f8a7ab72bb6e406d46c0c3c91ca4","title":"brazil costa rica philippe coutinho world cup group e match report","story":"Well, that was late and indeed a little ugly at times. On a breezy afternoon by the Gulf of Finland Brazil beat Costa Rica 2-0 at the St\u0026nbspPetersburg Stadium to ease their route towards the knockout stage of Russia 2018.The goals were both scored in injury time, the first by their best player on the day Philippe Coutinho, who came haring through a crowd on to a touch from Gabriel Jesus to poke the ball through the legs of Keylor Navas and send the yellow-shirted stands into a fever.As the clock ticked down Neymar added a second, the Costa Rica defence finally parting after some fine, dogged efforts. Brazil’s captain celebrated like a World Cup winner after stabbing the ball into the net from Douglas Costa’s cross. And it was an eventful day all round for Neymar, who grumbled and moaned and threw himself to the floor, and might have been sent off in the second half for a combination of dissent and ing.At the final whistle the world’s costliest player could be seen weeping dramatically on the pitch, shoulders shuddering, hands shielding his visage from the world. Indeed.Brazil have four points in Group\u0026nbspE. A draw with Serbia will guarantee progress. This game will be remembered for Coutinho’s fine driving efforts in central midfield and for some well-timed substitutions by Tite. But it will also be coloured by Neymar’s preposterous antics, and for a sense of lost focus at various stages.A turning point seemed to have arrived around the hour mark as the referee Björn Kuipers of the Netherlands, finally snapped. As Brazil defended a corner Kuipers could be seen telling Brazil’s captain to be quiet in the way an exasperated father might\u0026nbspspeak to a sullen and spoiled teenager.Seventeen minutes later Kuipers was finally beaten into submission. No doubt it wears you down. As Giancarlo González brushed the Neymar abdomen with his hand Brazil’s captain toppled backwards in ludicrous fashion, a dying sapling swept away by a mudslide. Kuipers gave the penalty. Neymar lay on the floor being nursed by his teammates, as though finally\u0026nbspvictorious in his battle with injustice.Out of his sight Kuipers trotted off, looked at the VAR screen, and reversed the decision. He should also have booked Neymar for cheating. But well-played Mr Kuipers. A penalty would have been reward for superstar strops and generally graceless behaviour. A Brazil World Cup campaign is a notch in the nation’s pop-cultural history. It deserves better than this.This World Cup has been waiting for a statement performance, for one of the more celebrated teams to decide that in fact this tournament is there for the taking if somebody can get the thrusters lined up. This wasn’t it from Brazil, at least not for the opening 85 minutes.Hopes had been high at kick-off. The stadium in St Petersburg is a stunning thing with a roof fanned out around steel girders of dizzying scale, ranged above the pitch like an iron giant cradling his fingers.Brazil did press hard at the start, Coutinho shooting just over after Bryan Ruiz had given him the ball.\u0026nbspAfter which, the congealment. The blue shirts were slow through midfield, a porridge of sideways passing. It was Costa Rica who should have taken the lead on 12 minutes, as Celso Borges shot low and hard but past the left-hand post from a cut-back from\u0026nbspRuiz.Neymar began to intrude, writhing and leaping at every challenge. He is targeted for rough treatment but he invites it too, never once hiding his disgust and his distraction.Again he went down, this time after “putting a hat on” Cristian Gamboa (nicking the ball over his head) a terrible humiliation in Brazilian football. Again there were chunterings to the referee, constant close-ups of that pained Neymar face. This is a different player right now to the sprightly warrior of 2014, transformed into a mardy drama magnet. Life moves pretty fast, Neymar old boy. If you don’t stop rolling around once in awhile, you could miss it.As the teams penetrated the dressing rooms at half-time Neymar approached the referee and prattled on some more. Clearly he has rushed his way back to this tournament. But he doesn’t deal with rustiness well. And he was overshadowed by Coutinho here, who was the hub of the team and who should be given as much leverage as he likes to make the game up in front of him.Tite took off Willian at half-time and put on the more direct Douglas Costa. Suddenly Brazil were surging forward, Gabriel Jesus heading powerfully on to the bar from a Costa cross. The ball bounced out to Coutinho whose shot\u0026nbspwas deflected just wide by Gamboa.Tite twisted again, bringing on Roberto Firmino for Paulinho. Neymar shot wide of the post on the run with space in front of him. And moments late he was finally booked, this time for a pathetic hissy fit after a foul. Two late goals disguised a distracted performance that improved as the tempo rose but Tite will have plenty to ponder from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27944d3b0fe95db4d6fcc8b3f37df90638e71845/0_155_3674_2204/master/3674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a2bffdecc9517e65f4d0202277ccab7","title":"nigeria iceland ahmed musa world cup group d match report","story":"The celebrations erupted in Lagos and it can be safely assumed that they spread to La Plata, too. Nigeria gave themselves a lifeline, punishing wastefulness from Iceland with a second-half performance that pulsated with counterattacking menace, and their deserved victory was almost as significant to Argentina. Had Iceland won then Jorge Sampaoli’s team would have been virtually down and out instead three points against Nigeria in St Petersburg would give them a strong chance of reaching the last 16 and the one certainty is that, however things play out next Tuesday, the denouement to a tantalisingly poised Group D will be difficult to take the eyes off.It is Nigeria who sit confidently in the box seat for second place, though, and they can thank Ahmed Musa for two exhilarating goals. Musa was brought in by Gernot Rohr to provide extra cutting edge and rewarded his manager handsomely, both times finishing rapid breaks with panache and vindicating the decision to overhaul a side that had barely turned up against Croatia. Nigeria’s new-look back three did not have everything their own way and were particularly fortunate not to endure a fraught last 10 minutes when Gylfi Sigurdsson uncharacteristically wafted a VAR-awarded penalty over the bar. But Rohr’s tweaks at both ends eventually paid off and Iceland, whose usual cohesion deserted them after the break, now need a rescue act of their own.The analysis was fair. Iceland hardly overran Nigeria in a frayed opening 45 minutes but did, at least, manufacture some chances. Rohr had wondered whether they would be affected by the Volgograd heat, a smothering 32 degrees despite the early-evening kick-off, but they began with the greater thrust and Gylfi Sigurdsson twice extended Francis Uzoho early on. He might have done better with the second of those efforts, curled into the keeper’s arms when located in space by Alfred Finnbogason, and although Nigeria were clearly operating with more bite than their previous outing the traffic in the opposite direction posed little threat.Then again there was plenty to get used to. As well as making threepersonnel changes and altering the formation, Rohr shifted Victor Moses to right wing-back and Mikel John Obi to a deeper midfield position than the No 10 he usually occupies for the Super Eagles. “It was not easy to convince them but finally they did it well,” he said. That should have gone without saying: those are the players’ club roles and Nigeria certainly looked better balanced as the game went on, asserting near-total control after going ahead.Their grasp would have been far wobblier if Finnbogason, glancing a free-kick wide from in front of goal just before the break, had produced the kind of finishing touch several of Iceland’s deliveries had invited. But they were two goals up before being seriously threatened again and the manner of Musa’s interventions spoke of what a devastating side they can be when given space to stretch out into.The first was particularly galling for Iceland, who fancied their chances of causing some consternation when Aron Gunnarsson launched one of numerous long throws. This one was cleared with little bother and Iceland, most of their men ahead of the ball, were now in trouble. Musa won an important header in midfield to keep Nigeria’s counter alive and then, galloping 50 yards further forward, stretched out a leg to beat a dozing Ragnar Sigurdsson to Moses’ cross. The cushioned touch and blasted finish were sweet to the eye and, however Iceland responded, they risked leaving themselves open to more of the same punishment.That is exactly what transpired, the excellent Wilfred Ndidi coming close and Musa curling against the bar before the issue was finally settled. Musa blazed past Kari Arnason after receiving a ball down the left channel, rounded Hannes Halldrosson and converted confidently Nigeria were home and, perhaps, Leicester City fans were rubbing their eyes.The obligatory VAR incident kept them honest, correctly resolving that Tyronne Ebuehi had, after all, fouled Finnbogason in the area. Sigurdsson fell short of the standard he usually reaches for his country, confirming that Iceland must now prevail against a familiar foe while keeping their fingers crossed for a narrow Argentina win.“We’re like a married couple,” their manager Heimir Hallgrimsson said of likely group winners Croatia, who they have faced in the last three qualifying competitions. “We keep trying to get orced but we keep meeting up again.” Three countries in different corners of the world will buckle up for a tempestuous finale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd1c2bebf51421d15d5d267c559fdde4e34d4dd/1219_138_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20830ff4fef71a9740ee5964bd895a82","title":"serbia switzerland xherdan shaqiri world cup group e match report","story":"Of all the people, it had to be them. Suddenly, in the last minute, Xherdan Shaqiri was racing away, Serbs in pursuit but unable to catch him before he slipped the ball under Vladimir Stojkovic. It was the goal that defeated Serbia and put Switzerland in a strong position to progress to the next round, but it was also much more than that. As he turned and screamed, he took his shirt off, flexed his muscles and performed a double-eagle celebration, a recreation of the Albanian flag. Alongside him, Granit Xhaka did the same – for the second time.Xhaka had scored the equaliser, thumping in from 20 yards, now Shaqiri had the winner. Two Kosovans, two goalscorers, in a stadium where Russian and Serbian fans had come together, supporting a team that Shaqiri and Xhaka do not see as simple opponents. Shaqiri had the Kosovan flag stitched to his boot. Xhaka’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania. Together with Valon Behrami, they had been whistled by a crowd that chanted “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia!” A banner declared the two countries “brothers”.They had enjoyed the first half of this game, in which Serbia looked far superior, but had watched as they were hauled back early in the second, and beaten at the death. There could be few complaints either: in the final, frantic 30 minutes, Switzerland, emboldened by their changes and led by Shaqiri, had gone for them. It had not seemed likely since the moment Dusan Tadic cut back on the right and curled in a lovely cross for Aleksander Mitrovic to head past Yann Sommer from seven yards.The game was only five minutes old when the goal was scored, but it hadn’t been Serbia’s first opportunity – from virtually the same spot, Mitrovic had drawn a sharp save from the goalkeeper a minute before, this time supplied by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic – and it wouldn’t be the last either. The same three men were at the heart of everything Serbia did, Tadic, Mitrovc and Milinkovic-Savic combining superbly at a time when all Switzerland could aspire to was resistance.For the Swiss, every ball in was a drama, and there were many of them early on. Mitrovic controlled one on the chest and sent an overhead kick sailing just past the bar. Slowly, though, this became a game, Shaqiri increasingly involved. Blerim Dzemaili couldn’t quite guide Steven Zuber’s pass then bafflingly chose to cross when he should have shot. At the other end, Tadic, Mitrovic and Milinkovic-Savic threatened still and they might have doubled the lead when Dusko Tosic ed through the air, barely four yards out but failed to reach a corner, and Nemanja Matic couldn’t force it in at the far post. Next, Tadic struck a lovely shot on the bounce that flew just over.Switzerland equalised soon after the break, Shaqiri’s blocked shot running to Xhaka who thumped it first time from 20 yards, bending the ball hard into the net. His hands forming an eagle amidst the noise, and the game turned frantic. Tadic delivered a cross from which Mitrovic, hauled to the floor, appealed for a penalty and then sent the ball fizzing across the six-yard box.The best opportunity, though, came for the substitute Mario Gavranovic at the other end who hit the side-netting having been played through by Shaqiri. And Switzerland accelerated, the changes having an impact, Shaqiri running at the Serbs. Gavranovic got another superb chance when the other substitute, Breel Embolo, leaped superbly to head into his path, leaving him in front of goal 12 yards out.That time, Stojkovic scrambled to save but he could do nothing when Shaqiri ran towards him at the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8fd09d9be0806d89d833259f905ac82042a62a8/0_18_809_485/master/809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024a97fdd16e85dbe9015aad90367bdd","title":"three lions pride shows normal russian rules dont apply during world cup","story":"Di Cunningham, of Three Lions Pride, an LGBT supporters association, says she has no regrets after travelling to RussiaWaving a pride flag in public in Russia is, normally, as sure a way as any to ensure swift police attention and possible arrest. But a small group of LGBT England fans at the World Cup unveiled a “Three Lions Pride” rainbow banner at England’s first game against Tunisia in Volgograd on Monday, and plan to do the same at the second match in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday.Di Cunningham, one of the founders of Three Lions Pride, an LGBT supporters association backed by the FA and set up around two years ago, said it had been a difficult decision to come to Russia but it is not one she regrets.Stadium security held her at the entrance for a short period while they determined whether the flag would be allowed in but in the end gave the green light, and the police have been friendly.It is another sign of how normal Russian rules do not quite apply during World Cup month, down to a combination of gentle pressure from Fifa, a desire to show off an image of a friendly and tolerant Russia to the world, and a genuine desire to welcome the hundreds of thousands of fans who have descended on Russia from abroad.One Russian fan, whom Cunningham assumed was himself gay, came up to her before the Tunisia game to ask if the rainbow scarf was indeed a gay symbol. “He looked fascinated, you could see him processing it, and thinking this is just totally outside his experience. We set him up with some networking information,” she said.There were also fears about the response from sections of the England travelling support. A lot of LGBT people have been “alienated by English nationalism and the hooligan connotations” in the past, she said. At England’s game against Tunisia, one man shouted at her to “get off your soapbox and support the team”, but after Harry Kane had scored the winner, became more friendly.“You do have that worry with football always, that after a few drinks or with the passion of the game people can become monsters. But on the whole everyone has been positive. One man came up to me and said his son is gay, and thanked me for it.”Cunningham is one of a small number of gay England fans who have decided to travel to Russia and not hide their sexuality. Lee Johnson, 25, from Cambridge, planned to arrive in Russia on Friday in time for England’s second game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday. He said the stories of homosexual men being rounded up and tortured in Chechnya had given him pause for thought, but he had decided to come anyway. He plans to wear a Three Lions Pride scarf to the Panama game.“To an extent you have to respect the country you’re going to, so we’re not going to be in everyone’s faces. But at the same time, I’m not going to hide who I am,” he said.Russia made “gay propaganda among minors” illegal in 2013, meaning that waving a rainbow flag or airing pro-LGBT-rights sentiments in public is illegal. Authorities have repeatedly cracked down on attempts to hold protests in support of gay rights, often brutally, while last year the local authorities in Chechnya rounded up men suspected of being gay and tortured them.Chechnya’s capital Grozny is a Fifa-approved World Cup training venue, with the Egypt squad based there, despite criticism from rights groups. The region’s Kremlin-appointed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, posed with Egypt’s Mo Salah for a photo op, and said this week in an interview to the BBC that the anti-gay repressions did not happen because there are no gay men in Chechnya“We don’t have hemo-, hama-, what was the sexuality you said? We don’t know that word. We have a differnet outlook, a different mentality,” said Kadyrov. “We don’t have a single one of them, it’s all made up. Here, a man is a man, a woman is a woman, an animal is an animal, a dog is a dog.”On the opening day of the World Cup, British rights activist Peter Tatchell staged a one-person protest near Red Square, calling on president Vladimir Putin to investigate the torture of gay men in Chechnya. Tatchell was detained by police, with rather more politeness than might have been used if there was not a World Cup on, taken to the nearest police station and released with an administrative charge.“I don’t think human rights abusing countries like Russia should ever have been granted the World Cup in the first place,” said Tatchell in Moscow, the day before his arrest.Some LGBT fans, however, have a different opinion. Cunningham said she would rather England finished second than first in their group, because the first-placed team will play their knockout encounter in Rostov-on-Don, a southern Russian city known for its social conservatism. But she also said the majority of Russians have been “so, so, welcoming” and said she hoped their presence in the country might have an effect, even if a small one.“Things change slowly, and the visibility can help change things in people’s lives. There are lots of reasonable people here. Give it 30 years or hopefully sooner and nobody will be saying that being LGBT is at odds with a Russian lifestyle,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9167c0fb170b9814fd7879f4fc15a2c3040ed73/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b4c39a1e5c9b2a0d4f3e594f82a25a","title":"faces of the world cup fans from around the world show their colours","story":"Whether you support Senegal or Switzerland, the World Cup is a great excuse to get out the face paint or lion mask and display your patriotic pride"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ea6d27ba002988bd1e4b89d9beaed397bcdaab/0_31_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0451d4d026f7e52c4e2df7756ed02f7d","title":"serbia switzerland world cup 2018 live","story":"What you want to do now is cast your ratings for the players, who’ll be checking in later to make sure you’ve been fair. Switzerland have come from behind and taken all three points thanks to Shaqiri’s breakaway goal in the last minute! That didn’t look likely at half-time, when Serbia were leading 1-0 and manifestly superior. Xhaka struck a superb equaliser but Serbia were then denied a clear penalty for a foul on Mitrovic. Chances came and went at both ends. And then Shaqiri showed skill and composure to deliver a dramatic late twist. Serbia will have to beat Brazil in their last match to progress! Switzerland face Costa Rica knowing a draw will be enough for them.90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. And after that, if the score hasn’t change, expect the ref to be surrounded by Serbians pointing out the significance of his non-award of a blatantly penalty when the score was 1-1. 90 min: Akanji cleared a Serbia corner with a fine header. Someone in midfield swept a pass quickly to Shaqiri, who began a clever ran from inside his own half. Tosic tries to catch him offside (momentarily forgetting the rules?) and then realises his mistake and began chasing Shaqiri in a panic. But Shaqiri is too fast and keeps ahead of him as he scurries 40 yards forward .... and then keeps his cool and slides the ball past the advancing keeper and into the net! That’s surely the winner! And Shaqiri doesn’t care about the booking he gets for removing his shirt in ecstasy!89 min: Rodriguez with an outswinging corner for the Swiss. Mitrovic heads it clear without manhandling any opponents. 86 min: Radnjic hurtles down the left with all the vim of a man who has just entered the fray. He wins a corner. It’s curled into the area ... and the ref spots a foul this time. Freekick to Switzerland. A bewildered Mitrovic consults the ref again but is again ordered to scarper.86 min: Rodriguez’s shot from the freekick deflects off the wall and out for a corner. 86 min: Shaqiri embarks on another strong, bustling run. Matic trips him, giving Switzerland a freekick about 23 yards out, a little to the left of the D. Danger here ...84 min: Embolo leaps high to nod a cross down to Gavranovic. The striker is offside but the officials seem unaware of that so Stojkovic has to make a solid save. 83 min: Shaqiri shows laudable ambition but dreadful execution as he launches a 30-yard shot towards Poland. 82 min: Embolo rifles off a shot from 25 yards. It’s hard and true but straight at Stojkovic ... who almost does a Karius! But after an initial fumble he catches it on the second attempt. Serbia substitution: Radonjic on, Milivojevic off. “I simply don’t understand how VAR works,” snorts John Rogers. In that case, John, it’s not working. “Apparently the VAR team keep an eye on everything going on on the pitch and bring the referee’s attention to anything he or she might’ve missed. Likewise the ref can ask to look again at any incident. So in that case how could that not have been a penalty just now for Serbia?” Well they don’t pretend to keep an eye on everything. But they are supposed to alert the ref to any flagrant abuses he’s missed. So yes, that should have been a penalty. It was a clear and obvious foul. I can only assume the non-award of the spotkick is down to human error. Which, of course, VAR was intended to eliminate.76 min: Kolarvoc attack again. Kolarov threads a pass through to Ljajic in the Swiss box. He lets fly! But his rocket is grounded by a Swiss defender. Switzerland suddenly zoom down the other end, Shaqiri ducking and dodging his way into the area. But he’s crowded out before he can unleash a shot. This is hectic!74 min: Switzerland have found a second wind! Suddenly they’ve got Serbia backpedaling. This is intriguingly poised. “My browser is apparently a Switzerland fan and spent a few minutes after the equaliser having a melt down and repeating the goal post again and again until I got bored and hit F5. God help me if they lose. Though maybe I’ll just have to use it as a reason to go home early...Switzerland substitution: Embolo on, Dzemaili off. And Rodriguez is also off the pitch at the moment, getting blood cleaned off his face. His gesticulations suggest the injury was caused by someone’s flailing elbow. 70 min: It’s all Serbia now. Switzerland look like they’d take a point at this stage. That - according to my calculations on the fly - would leave them needing to beat Costa Rica by at least three goals to be sure of going through irrespective of the result of the Serbia-Brazil match. Serbia might have to beat Brazil.68 min: Milkinkovic-Savic slips a cute ball through to Tadic on the left this time. He fires in a vicious low cross. It whizzes across the face of goal, agonisingly beyond the reach of two attackers. Switzerland exhale.65 min: Tadic makes inroads down the right, then cuts on to his left and clips in a good cross. Mitrovic meets it but can’t get a proper contact on it because he is quite obviously being held down by not one but two defenders! He can’t believe the ref doesn’t award a penalty and demands an explanation in the forceful manner. All he gets his wag of the finger and a stern lecture about respecting authority. But it’s hard to respect authority when you’re on the end of decisions like that. 59 min: This is hot stuff now! The tempo has risen and there’s more oomph in the tackles. Switzerland smell blood and Serbia are eager to strike back. This could go either way.57 min: Shaqiri shows tremendous persistence down the left ... and then shows wonderful imagination and technique, curling a shot from a difficult angle beyond the keeper from outside the box. It hits the angle of post and bar and goes wide! What a thunderous strike! A shot by Shaqiri was deflectd into the path of Xhaka, running on to the ball about 25 yards out, to the left. He smacks a superbly controlled shot into the bottom corner! Then he wheels away and jubilates with his tea-mates! 54 min: As Xhaka celebrated that goal, he made a gesture with his hands. I don’t know what it was or what it meant. It looked like a flapping bird. Such as an eagle like the one in the Albanian flag? 50 min: Shaqiri scurries forward, then floats a pass towards Gavranovic, who lays it back to Rodriguez. The full-back has a pop from 25 yards. Then hurries back to whence he came and hopes no one ever mentions his shot again. 48 min: Serbia aren’t going to give up this lead easily. They’ve spent the first few minutes of this half in tight ranks in their own half. Switzerland have the ball but are short if ideas.46 min: Switzerland have made a change: Our man Seferovic has been replaced by Gavranovic. Will that give the Swiss the sharpness they lack? At the moment they’re a few blades short of an army knife.“Your correspondent Shawn Williamson is completely right, I believe,” writes Peter Van. “Haris Seferovic is not a World Cup-level striker (maybe not even a Swiss League-level striker). Switzerland have a lot in common with other teams in this World Cup: Morocco, Costa Rica, Peru... I thought all of them were decent and well organized. They just lacked any bite in front - which is why they’re all eliminated already, scoreless. Switzerland have scored a goal - from a corner - but they seem to suffer from the same problems: well organized, hardworking, technically gifted, useless within 20 yards of the goal.”Serbia are 45 minutes away from the last 16 for the first time in their independent history. Mitrovic gave them an early lead with a stonking header, and Serbia have had chances to score again. Switzerland had a couple, too, and have had a lot of possession without looking as dangerous as Serbia do when they attack. Mitrovic and Tadic have been terrific, especially the former, who is tormenting Schär.45+2 min: Matic booked for clunking into Lichtsteiner near half-way. A bit harsh, that. 45+1 min: A knock-down from Mitrovic to Tadic, who swipes across the bouncing ball beautifully and sends his shot fizzing just over the bar from 20 yards.44 min: Tadic pings over a beauatful corner. Tosic has a free header from five yards! And he completely misses the ball! Matic is too shocked to be able to react quickly enough to turn it into the net, stabbing it wide beyond the back post. 43 min: That’s more like it! Serbia take the fight to the other end. Tadic fires over a testing cross, the Matic does likewise from the left. No Serb managed to get on the end of either one but they made for hairy moments for the Swiss, all the same.42 min: Swtizerland are forcing Serbia back. The men in red have defended well so far, but it’d be a good idea to try to move the play upfield a tad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9025328545f2517439df442431bb45760126594/0_354_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6bf4b54b99a4b47b5bf1b211aea98a9","title":"africa finally uniting now we need good politics paul kagame","story":"With a free trade agreement signed, a new era of prosperity beckons for the African continentIn Africa, our biggest threats are also opportunities. By 2035, 450 million Africans will have joined the working age population, more than the rest of the world combined in that time. They will power our economies forward, as long as there are jobs they have the knowledge to perform.I was delighted to participate, along with other government officials and the private sector, in the second African Transformation Forum this week in Accra, Ghana, where restructuring our economies for the digital age was high on the agenda. The forum took place at a time when conditions for the continent’s transformation agenda have never been better.We are experiencing greatly accelerated progress towards the economic unification of our continent. In this year alone, the African Union has adopted the free movement protocol and inaugurated a single African air transport market, which will reduce not only ticket prices but also the need for stopovers on other continents.Most importantly, in March, 44 countries signed the Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Most other member states indicated their intention to follow suit in due course.Joining up diffuse, fragmented markets would be a leap forward. Doing this across borders will require governments to work closely with each other, and with the private sector.By creating a highly networked, frictionless marketplace, we will encourage the best products, services and ideas to rise to the top. This will boost the economy as a whole and open up opportunities for women, rural populations and other marginalised groups.Ultimately, the goal is to make our economies bigger and more dynamic. No country or company will lose out in the long term. This is why business leaders are called upon to be champions of continental integration, first of all by seizing these new opportunities to grow Africa’s firms.Business leaders now participate actively and meaningfully in African Union summits. This is based on the understanding that the shared prosperity at the core of the union’s Agenda 2063 can only happen when the public and private sectors are working closely together.The business community should also contribute to holding governments accountable for putting what has been agreed into action, and pushing all of us to do more, and better.For example, given the transportation and logistical challenges on our vast continent, much more investment in joint regional infrastructure, including digital networks, is required.Globally, there is no shortage of finance, both public and private. We can attract more of it to Africa, and help close the investment gap, by planning big infrastructure regionally. This generates projects of sufficient size to interest major funds, and enhances the business case. It also makes regional integration tangible and irreversible.We also need to match external capital with African capital. African savings are not being mobilised effectively. This can help reduce risk perceptions, and also ensure we share the upside of profitable deals.Building the capacity of African firms creates badly needed jobs and skills right here on the continent and, as African construction and services firms grow, costs and operational risks will decrease.The Continental Free Trade Area goes against the prevailing trend of moving away from regional integration and the multilateral trading system. This is already making Africa stand out to global markets and investors.Finally, prosperity rests on good politics and a secure environment, because the transformation agenda requires a broad consensus that is sustained across decades. Transformation requires leadership and accountability at every level, beginning at the top, but not stopping there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5f1b0af11753de7a3adc837af96929a753fae6/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a899ed1b7d6f9a6010cd34a36ce968cb","title":"hypothetical thinking pale imitation real life","story":"When you think ahead you rely on your intellect and powers of reasoning. Yet when you get there, it’s another matterYou’re surely aware, by now, of the Trolley Problem, the most famous of the thought experiments philosophers like to construct when they really ought to be working. But, to recap: a runaway train is hurtling down a track towards five railway workers who’ll be killed unless you pull a lever that will ert it to a siding, where there’s only one worker, who’ll be killed instead. Do you pull the lever? This question sorts people into those for whom all that matters are the consequences (how many humans end up dead?) versus those who think it’s wrong to be the active cause of someone’s death. Most people claim to be the former, until you tweak the story so the dilemma is whether to push a fat man off a\u0026nbspbridge to stop the train and save the five workers. Suddenly, barely anyone is willing to say they’d make the active choice, though the death toll remains identical.A third group of people just finds thought experiments annoyingly unrealistic: in reality, that train would still be stuck in a station 20 miles back, “waiting for a crew member”. A\u0026nbspnew study from Ghent University in Belgium is for them. How do people respond to such dilemmas, the researchers wondered, in real life? Due to the rampant spread of health-and-safety culture, they couldn’t use real trains and actually kill people. Instead, they used mice. All participants answered a raft of moral hypotheticals, but some then faced a real-world choice: would they stand by while a\u0026nbspcountdown clock ticked down, whereupon five mice would receive a painful but non-lethal electric shock? Or would they press a button, erting the shock to a cage containing a single mouse? (The setup wasn’t really real, to be clear: no mice were shocked.) People turned out to be much less likely to choose the passive option when it was no longer hypothetical. When real suffering is involved –\u0026nbspeven mouse suffering – more of us are willing to do what it takes to minimise harmful consequences, whatever our abstract principles.There’s a lesson here, I think, that goes beyond improbable train-related emergencies to any contexts in which we’re trying to predict how we’d respond to events: moral dilemmas, but also how we’d cope with a breakup or bereavement, whether we’d flourish or founder if we switched careers, whether we’d be happier moving to another city, and so on. Thinking ahead to any such situation – as when contemplating the Trolley Problem – you’re obliged to rely on your intellect and powers of reasoning. You try to think of all relevant variables, and figure out how they’d interact.Yet when you get there, as when those experimental subjects saw the mice, it’s another matter. You respond not just intellectually but emotionally and bodily your automatic, intuitive brain (“system one”, in Daniel Kahneman’s terminology) kicks in and even on the intellectual\u0026nbsplevel, there may be numerous variables\u0026nbspyou’d failed to think of.Hypothetical thinking, in short, can only ever be a\u0026nbsppale imitation of real life. On balance, that’s good news: a reason to worry less about the future, and trust that, if the situation you’re fretting about occurs, you might surprise yourself by knowing precisely what to do.Would You Kill The Fat Man?, by David Edmonds, is the definitive account of “trolleyology”, and an unnerving way to discover that your moral principles are a lot more fluid than you thought.Read this: In her 2017 book We Need To Talk, the American journalist Celeste Headlee investigates why we’re so remarkably bad at listening to other viewpoints, and offers strikingly useful tips for better conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ebe29c4111d78ac3f0afd7eb22c373c388c569/307_464_7882_4729/master/7882.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2308a9babc7196c9d53c96b625c4fce","title":"thomasina miers recipe for raspberry cardamom and almond cake","story":"A sticky, fruity treat is just the pudding for a summertime picnicHot sun, sweet berries.

Spread half this mixture over the bottom of the tin.Lightly whisk the eggs and beat them into the rest of the cake batter. Stir in the yoghurt, cardamom, baking powder and rosewater, and mix well. Pour into the tin and scatter over the raspberries, allowing them to sink into the batter. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds and caster sugar, and bake for 60-70 minutes until an inserted skewer comes out clean. The mix will still be a little soft, but it will firm up as it cools.Serve at room temperature with creme fraiche or softly whipped cream – all the more delicious if you can find farmhouse cream.Roast any leftover nuts in the oven with a tablespoon of olive oil and a few scrunches of sea salt for a delicious pre-dinner snack. Try making ice-cream with raspberries and rosewater, too – it is a lovely combination made even more delicious with a teaspoon of dark sherry vinegar. Fry leftover flaked almonds in butter, add fresh lemon and pour over grilled fish for a great, very quick dinner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee76f7ea3560fb05690da4b9f0865390e752dc2/97_0_2270_1362/master/2270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a7acfcfdfde991204c0f60e86726df","title":"paul mccartney serves up surprise performance in liverpool pub","story":"Rock star returns to home city for appearance on Carpool Karaoke with James CordenAs homecoming gigs for one of the world’s biggest rock stars go, it was fairly low key: a small band on a slightly bigger stage in a local pub. But for the drinkers who just happened to be in the Philharmonic Dining Rooms in Liverpool, seeing Sir Paul McCartney perform was probably the best gig of their lives.There was amazement, dancing and more than a few tears when one of Liverpool’s most celebrated sons returned for his appearance on The Late Late Show’s Carpool Karaoke with James Corden on Tuesday.McCartney performed a piano rendition of When I’m Sixty-Four as he revisited his childhood home, showing Corden the back room where he wrote songs with fellow Beatle John Lennon. Walking upstairs in the small terrace, he showed off his old “acoustic chamber” – the toilet where he would sit, strum and sing for hours.Describing how he and Lennon had played She Loves You to his father, McCartney recalls him asking if they could change the refrain to “yes, yes, yes” because there were already too many Americanisms in common use. “We did not heed his advice. Had we have done, who knows what could have happened,” he said. Tweeting a link to the episode, Corden wrote: “Ok, so here it is. Quite possibly the best #CarpoolKaraoke we’ve done so far. I hope you like it. I’ll never ever forget it. Take a breath and jump in.”The pair started the show singing the Beatles hit Drive My Car, while cruising through the city, replacing the song’s “beep beeps” with honks of the horn. On Penny Lane, they popped into a barber shop – which had a picture on the wall of a much younger McCartney getting his hair cut – much to the delight of the hairdresser. Corden became emotional as the pair sang Let It Be in the car. “I can remember my granddad, who’s a musician, and my dad sitting me down and saying, ‘We’re going to play you the best song you’ve ever heard’. And I remember them playing me that. If my granddad was here right now, he’d get an absolute kick out of this,” Corden said. “That’s the power of music,” McCartney replied.McCartney harmonised with Corden singing Blackbird and his new single Come On to Me from the album Egypt Station.But the 18-time Grammy award winner saved the best performance until last, when he appeared from behind a curtain in the Liverpool Philharmonic Dining Rooms, or “the Phil”, where he had played and occasionally drunk as a young man.Within seconds, the small crowd was on its feet, and more poured through the door as word spread, as he performed A Hard Day’s Night, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Love Me Do, Back in the USSR and Hey Jude. The star said the journey back to his childhood home had made him reflect on the trajectory of his life. “The distance from here to where we went, and where we are now is phenomenal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f47444656a84109e1640db0a28b46c8170d0e6b/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c4377d723f16e90053a35668fa332a7","title":"the age of patriarchy how an unfashionable idea became a rallying cry for feminism today","story":"A term that was derided and abandoned a decade ago has come roaring back to life. On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his TV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the event was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In the course of a passionate speech, Oprah Winfrey told the audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion, politics and workplace”.Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the scene before him augured the beginning of a revolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s primal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let alone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of person – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or the kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind.Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts it is an unexpected recent addition to the vocabulary of the red-carpet interview it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the #MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are inidual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the term’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable.For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the ideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism.But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it better, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at a party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body.In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a host of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force from the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For it allows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the plight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and the Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction?For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was self-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the poems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible it tries very hard not to draw attention to the means of its endurance.But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who humiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a gender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by a male partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of Angela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so few meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them.The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it to describe patterns derived from the structure of the family to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in the way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people.Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would the world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots of pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a zero-sum game.“Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and out of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary Wollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as “the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a theory of social relations.By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the same time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or London. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain women were rapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims have been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels it deeply interested Sigmund Freud and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a distant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and mother goddesses) held power in the world.For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the “chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote.When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was associated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”.It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone of experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own circumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a serious education or the opportunity to earn a living. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the daughters against the fathers”.Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a social structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as men would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the champions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind.In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of little interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light. Oppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine.“Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for this work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of male dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”.The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of the weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same isions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place.“Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a coherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell hooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in society was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must “let go of sexist thoughts and action”.Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the same way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that for African American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women.Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.”The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperinidualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote.A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City “girl power” pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good.Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to arrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of oppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it is because feminism has returned with renewed vigour because inequality has not been eradicated.In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me.Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.”While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.”But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a bellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment.“Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a satisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it, and it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those who fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed.One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can unravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it.But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle iniduals than structures, signs rather than causes.At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to recognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge.

At the same time, a few hundred metres away, the prime minister took to a makeshift stage in College Gardens to revive her vision of post-Brexit Britain.Theresa May framed her remarks in terms of the crisis shaking the established order of liberal democracy across Europe and the US. If May has one core belief, it is that to fail to deliver on the EU referendum would fan the flames of populism.“Nothing would hurt our democracy more than to give the people the choice, and then not to trust their judgement when they give it,” she told guests at the Policy Exchange thinktank’s summer reception. Plenty of Conservatives would dismiss her sentiment as simplistic. However this appeal to the will of the people has become a monstrous cudgel against more nuanced response. The paradoxical consequence is that, having weaponised this “will”, it is now threatening the political cohesion upon which liberal parliamentary democracy, and the Tory party itself, depends. Leaving the EU is disproportionately a crisis for the Tories. With the second anniversary of the referendum falling on Saturday, the dilemmas remain over how to leave and what the consequences will be. But one other question has arisen: is a post-Brexit Conservative party an oxymoron?This month’s Prospect magazine asks if the Tories can survive Brexit (spoiler alert: no). Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, writes in this week’s New Statesman (£): “We will not know the final nature of Brexit for many months, or even years, but what we do know is what it is doing to our politics.” He warns that his former boss is doomed, like a character in a tragedy, to see the need for change yet be unable to deliver it. “Destiny dictated that she would be the prime minister who delivers Brexit … and few domestic reforms.”As Timothy acknowledges, however, it is not just Brexit. It is what is left of the Conservatives afterwards.The party in the country – a shrinking band of fewer than 100,000, disproportionately old, white males in favour of Brexit – retains its oppressive control over the Conservatives’ future as the electors of any future leader. It is easy to see it as the embodiment of the party’s rediscovered appeal to older, poorer, whiter parts of the UK. Sitting amid the wreckage of Cameron’s failed experiments in modernisation – the NHS reforms that May has pledged to reverse, the arbitrary cruelties of universal credit, the unaccountable education reforms, and the referendum itself – the party is searching for a more appealing reason to exist.One response is a perceptible leaning towards a prelapsarian Toryism, the era before Margaret Thatcher.Neil Carmichael, a former chair of the cross-party education committee, regards Mayism almost as a reversion to the era of Ted Heath and the 1970s. “You listen to the talk of an industrial strategy and the power of the state to intervene, and it is almost as if the Thatcher years never existed.”It has become commonplace – as an example of how new thinking is possible even in the darkest hours – to reference the 1942 Beveridge report. Unlike Beveridge, however, the increase in intellectual headscratching on the fringes of Westminster is not so much at the frontier of new thinking: it is an attempt to find pragmatic solutions to the overwhelming sense that capitalism has failed. In September, the second Big Tent ideas festival is to be held in Cambridge. Partly an attempt to capture the attention of the next generation, it is morphing into something bigger. Its prime mover, the former minister George Freeman, fears the government has failed to comprehend the scale of the challenge ahead. “As the last election showed, simply implementing Brexit without a bold programme of one nation reforms will fail.”  Lined up against Freeman and his small band of radicals is Michael Gove, the environment secretary and self-appointed analyst of disaster. Along with Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, he is the chief hope of reformers seeking more incremental change. This month, Gove made a speech about the economy that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, might have applauded.“Economic power has been concentrated in the hands of a few … crony capitalists have rigged the system in their favour … debt has fuelled growth in an unsustainable fashion… Our politics, culture and regulatory models have worked against innovation ... Many of our fellow citizens have seen less and less value placed on their work and themselves … communities and iniduals have seen so much of what they value which is beyond economics … overlooked or ignored.”As May noted wryly on Wednesday, Gove has become ubiquitous on the thinktank circuit. With Davidson, he is backing the newest one, called Onward. Its name is not a deliberate echo of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche party, just as Gove would deny being a Macronesque-style disrupter. Yet Onward boasts that it is about more than ideas. The spokesman, Nick Faith, says: “Onward is all about outcomes, about what works.” On Monday it publishes its first report, on housing. It is an attempt to combine a “big bang” idea – on the buy-to-let market – with pragmatic interventions. “If you come in with the viewpoint that either the market or the state is best at delivering something, you’re starting from the wrong position. The position should be, what is the best approach to get the best outcome for the inidual. Your ideology can’t cloud what works best in practice.”But there are many Tories for whom the libertarian Ayn Rand is still queen and the market still sacred. These are the people who fear a soft Brexit would really mean Brexit in name only. On Wednesday, one cabinet Brexiter celebrated the passage of the withdrawal bill with a toast to a change in the political weather. But no political meteorologist can forecast what that change might mean, nor if the Tory party has the capacity to respond.

Bercow will resist attempts to topple him by critical Conservative MPs as he believes the Commons needs an experienced parliamentarian in the role to supervise “very complicated and highly technical” legislation. The Speaker, who was elected in 2009, said in the run-up to that election he would stand down within nine years – meaning Friday would be his deadline – as he did not see the post as a job for life.He has faced calls from some MPs to stick to his original promise and resign after a series of allegations about his bullying behaviour towards former Commons staff, all of which he has denied. But a source close to the Speaker’s office said “the clock was reset” at the 2017 general election when Bercow stood for re-election pledging to see the Brexit process through.His election literature from last year, obtained by the , said: “Once the ballot papers have been counted, the country will have a few challenging years as we seek to establish a new relationship with the European Union. “In the House of Commons, for example, this could require as many as 15 different new laws, some of which will be very complicated and highly technical in nature. “During this process, I believe that parliament and the nation would be best served by a very experienced Speaker with an established track record of efficiency, fairness and sensitivity to all sides of the argument. It is on this basis as well as my local record as your MP that I seek re-election.”The source added: “This election material speaks for itself – the clock was reset in 2017 and the Speaker was voted in on the basis that he would see the Brexit process through.”Bercow has gained a reputation as a moderniser who changed the sitting hours of the Commons so they would be more family-friendly and has attempted to make ministers more accountable to parliament. However, he was forced to defend his impartiality after it was reported that he backed remain at the EU referendum and he provoked controversy after vetoing an address to parliament by the US president, Donald Trump, in an unprecedented intervention.This week it emerged that £2.4m of taxpayers’ money had been used for non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to prevent 53 Commons staff from speaking out after they left.Bercow’s office said: “The Speaker was elected by the house in 2017 for the course of the parliament. In the event he has anything to say on his future plans, he will make an announcement to the house first.”Favourites to succeed Bercow include the deputy speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is known for his low-key, no-nonsense approach and who proved himself last month when he stood in for Bercow during PMQs, leaving some MPs shouting “more, more”. Harriet Harman, Britain’s longest-serving female MP who has a reputation for being firm but fair, is said to be interested in the role, which would make her only the second female Speaker in the Commons’ history.The senior Labour backbencher Chris Bryant has also been tipped for the post, along with the Tory Eleanor Laing, who is also a deputy speaker, although convention suggests it is more likely to be a Labour politician next time round.

It is expected to be smaller, with a few thousand people attending. Promoters say it will “focus on freedom from the EU, freedom from terror, freedom of speech, freedom from sharia law and unity of all people irrespective of race or creed”. Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, is expected to be present, but not the former leader Nigel Farage. Police also expect members of the far-right English Defence League and the anti-Islam group Pegida to show up at a march that will conclude a few hundred metres away from where the People’s Vote event will end, and near an Eid celebration in Trafalgar Square.Anti-Brexit campaigners are focused on trying to create popular support for a referendum on whatever deal Theresa May achieves in negotiations with the EU. Polling and focus group work led Open Britain to use the phrase People’s Vote in calling for a final referendum, in which remaining in the EU would be an option on the ballot paper.The People’s Vote campaign is also highlighting the role of ordinary citizens, with Ciaran Donovan, a delivery driver from Romford, east London, expected to appear on stage to sign a petition demanding a referendum on the final deal. The roughly £100,000 cost of the protest was raised over seven days by a crowdfunding campaign.The George Soros-backed group Best for Britain has been separately campaigning for a second referendum, focusing on newspaper and outdoor advertising, and local campaigning in parliamentary seats where they hope to persuade the sitting MP to support an amendment for another vote. It is encouraging supporters to attend the People’s Vote march."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f2be714352f1bab787b0d0923ab65db5e825f7/0_10_3180_1909/master/3180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1340555c37371dcb0efd33c9de7bcab2","title":"alpha centauri coronation stakes royal ascot jessica harrington","story":"• Jessica Harrington’s filly strides home to a six-length success• Eqtidaar wins Commonwealth Cup for Jim Crowley“It’s over quicker, which is great,” Jessica Harrington said after winning the Coronation Stakes with Alpha Centauri here on Friday, when asked about the difference between racing on the Flat and over jumps. On that basis her latest Group One win on the Flat must have been her idea of the perfect race, as it was over almost before it had started in earnest.Alpha Centauri was one of three 1,000 Guineas winners in the field for the feature race on Friday, but she was travelling much better than any of her opponents from the start and was still cruising on the bridle as they lined up for home with just over two furlongs to run.As soon as Colm O’Donoghue, her jockey, asked for an effort, Alpha Centauri accelerated clear and added to her lead all the way to the line, which she crossed six lengths in front of Threading in a track-record time. Billesdon Brook, the 66-1 winner of the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket, was another three-and-a-half lengths behind in fourth, while Teppal, who took the French 1,000 Guineas, trailed home in ninth.Harrington made her name as a National Hunt trainer but her Flat operation has expanded significantly in recent years and she now has as many Flat horses as jumpers in her stable. She is one of only a handful of trainers to have won the Champion Hurdle, Champion Chase and Gold Cup at Cheltenham and has proved equally adept at winning top races on the level, though Alpha Centauri’s win was both her first at the Royal meeting and her first in a British Group One.Harrington said: “It’s 50-50 and it’s grand because I’ve got lots of people to work for me and all the family, both daughters are working for me now and I’m about to get my son-in-law. I don’t quite know what’s going to happen then but I hope we’ll all get on well together.“I’m relieved firstly, because I got quite wound up before the race. I was nervous today because I know she’s very good and it was rather nice when we went to the Irish Guineas because we were a bit under the radar. Today we were favourite and there to be shot at.“Colm was very confident on her and she settled great. I thought he’d got to the front a bit soon but the further she went, the better she went.”Alpha Centauri is clearly the best three-year-old filly of the current crop by some margin, at least when the ground is fast, and she could now take on colts and older horses in the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville in August.Jim Crowley’s build-up to the Royal meeting took an unfortunate turn when he needed stitches in a cut lip following a weighing-room brawl with Raul da Silva, but the former champion jockey was the centre of attention for the right reasons here on Friday as he guided Eqtidaar to victory in the Group One Commonwealth Cup.This was Crowley’s second Group One winner for the owner Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum, who hired him as retained rider at the end of his championship season in 2016, and his first in Britain in the blue-and-white colours.Charlie Appleby already has the Derby winner in his stable thanks to the success of Masar at Epsom earlier this month and he added another earlier on the card when Old Persian took the “Ascot Derby”, as the King Edward VII Stakes is familiarly known.William Buick settled Old Persian close to the pace from the off and he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish a length and three quarters in front of Rostropovich and give Buick his third winner of the meeting.Ryan Moore and Dettori both drew a blank on the fourth day, and Buick is now tied with Moore in second place in the race to be the week’s leading jockey. Dettori with four winners, is still in control, but the tight race will add extra spice to the meeting’s final day on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cd9aca71a0d22612d8e7f477596ddc82bfc1428/27_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31d6b17218364e2c359ce4ed2ef78ea3","title":"england top order bairstow roy hales world cup cricket","story":"England must wish the World Cup was taking place next week rather than next year – at least their batsmen must. All of them are in sparkling form, flogging Australian bowlers to every corner of every ground they\u0026nbspencounter.No one is hitting the ball with greater certainty than Jason Roy, who purred to his sixth ODI hundred at Chester-le-Street while posting another century opening partnership with Jonny Bairstow. Already this union has produced more 100 partnerships in one-day international cricket than any other English pairing and they are barely beyond the honeymoon stage.When asked whether he has ever batted better, Roy uses phrases that would probably not have leapt from the lips of his Surrey predecessors. It is hard to imagine Jack Hobbs or John Edrich or even Alec Stewart responding to such a question with: “Yeah, this is probably the best headspace I’ve been in, knowing my role in the team.” Roy spoke shortly before it was announced that Paul Farbrace will take over as coach for England’s upcoming Twenty20 matches against Australia and India so the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, can spend that time watching the England Lions in action in the Tri-series prior to returning to duties for the one-day series against India, which begins on 12 July.Roy will no doubt be involved in that encounter at Trent Bridge given his excellent form but he is impressively determined not to get too carried away. “Our main aim is just to make sure that these are just stepping stones to the bigger picture, which is the World Cup,” he said.Barring some extraordinary turn of events England already know the identity of the key batsmen in their World Cup squad a year ahead of schedule, while the selectors may be more concerned by how they might strengthen their bowling options.Eoin Morgan has pointed out that selecting the best XI when everyone is fit is not a task that he is looking forward to, but it is a dilemma he welcomes. Oddly enough Alex Hales’s nondescript unbeaten 34 on Thursday must have been as satisfying as any of the other innings with victory all but assured Hales was unusually restrained, determined that there should not be any hiccups similar to those experienced in the first match at the Oval it was an innings of impressive self-denial. Yet Hales is still not guaranteed his place in the best team.This is not Roy’s problem. “It’s a tough call for the management,” he says. “But it has nothing to do with me.” Yet here is one of the oddities of any sporting team. The reality is that team-mates in a cricket side are inevitably rivals, fighting to retain their places, yet they are also obliged to be supportive of their colleagues.England’s one-day side seems as unified as they come. The players genuinely get on well several of them go on holiday together even though they are compelled to spend weeks together when “working”, all of which reflects an unusually positive set-up.Roy reflects upon that in the only way he can when confronted with the Hales conundrum. “You obviously want everyone to do well. There’s no animosity outside the changing room. We are all very good friends. It’s just a case of wanting the best out of your mate.” But all of them naturally want to be in the best\u0026nbspXI as well.For the moment this healthy competition seems to be spurring England’s top three to even greater heights and it may well be that Morgan and Trevor Bayliss are especially adept at exploiting this situation. Hence as the circus heads to Old Trafford for Australia’s final 50-over ordeal one senses England’s top three will not be resting on their laurels they will be trying to outdo one another – in the most comradely manner possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a1adc7518de13f336951a23abcef4fef3486e8/1432_355_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1520d170f775a2a88b0d9e5be1c1f48a","title":"gregor townsend scotland argentina test rugby","story":"Scotland’s players received a rocket after failing to achieve lift-off in Houston last weekend and their head coach, Gregor Townsend, expects atonement against an Argentina side who have forgotten what victory tastes\u0026nbsplike.Townsend has made eight changes for Saturday’s match in Resistencia from the side beaten by the USA, seven at forward. He may have left a number of players at home for a tour that started in Canada but the defeat by a side that had never before beaten a tier-one nation was a considerable setback.“I have learned a lot on this tour about this group,” Townsend said. “We have exposed more players to Test rugby and we believe that will put us in a much better position in the future. It will help us for the season ahead and\u0026nbspbeyond.”The hooker and captain, Stuart McInally, returns from injury while the second-row Tim Swinson is the only survivor at forward with Townsend expecting Argentina to look to dominate up front.However, the Pumas have become neither one thing nor the other after sacrificing their traditional 10-man game based on set-piece dominance for a wider approach.Their series defeat against a largely experimental Wales side last week prompted their head coach, Daniel Hourcade, to announce he would be standing down after the Scotland match. The decision not to consider players who are based abroad means he has only one team from which choose, the Jaguares, limiting competition for places.Townsend said: “We have to impose our game on them we have not done enough of that on this tour. We need to keep hold of the ball and put Argentina under pressure because when we do we look really dangerous.“The breakdown is huge in today’s game and we have to have a greater presence after a tackle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae323422d12b928ded42c49f9846ab1cfd114a3/7_197_4381_2629/master/4381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a19ce3e11c378d794fd1e765632313c1","title":"xx","story":"There will doubtless be no shortage of intensity at the sharp end of the French Grand Prix but away from a tight title fight, for many in France it will be an unashamedly emotional affair. For Jacques Laffite, the race’s return to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year absence and at the Paul Ricard circuit has special resonance. A pleasure amplified by the joie de vivre the former F1 driver derives from Lewis Hamilton’s performances.France hosted the first grand prix in 1906 and had held 86 further meetings by its last race in 2008 at Magny-Cours. Unsurprisingly a decade on there is a celebratory air at Paul Ricard, which hosted the race 14 times between 1971 and 1990. Laffite knows it well, as the charismatic 74-year-old raced at the track in his heyday when driving for Ligier, taking six wins.In the 70s and early 80s, Laffite and France were synonymous. His French team, running in the country’s traditional blue colour, also sported that most Gallic of cigarette sponsors, Gitanes. Laffite retired in 1986 when Alain Prost was in his pomp, having already taken two of his four titles, and the French Grand Prix was a meeting whose future never looked in doubt.Laffite was an F1 commentator for France’s TF1 when the race was last hosted and he believes its resurrection is of real importance. “The people have missed it,” he says. “We have been waiting for 10 years, the French Grand Prix was one of the best in the world for a long time. We love F1 here, its return is good for everybody, especially for France and especially at Paul Ricard.”He took his and Ligier’s first GP win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix and stresses how important it was for him to be racing for a French team. At the next round, his home race in Dijon, he and the team realised they had made their mark.“There were so many people that turned up they did not have enough tickets to sell,” he says. “It is stressful but I love it, to race in my country. It felt like a real home race, especially with Ligier, and Gitanes in a French blue car. It was fun to see all these people supporting us.”He rates one of his best performances at home as his run at Ricard in 1980. He had claimed pole with a superb lap but, although leading for much of the race, could manage only third after his tyres went off. He is still fond of the circuit, which is using its classic configuration this weekend, and pleased it is hosting the return for the French GP.Perhaps most intriguingly he is looking forward to how Hamilton takes to the challenge. “He is my favourite driver,” he says. “Hamilton is more of a fighter than Sebastian Vettel. When you need it he is able to do something incredible with the car. Vettel is really competitive but is not taking as many risks compared to Hamilton. Hamilton is able to just do things better than Vettel.”It is Vettel, however, who leads Hamilton by one point after a 15-point swing in the Ferrari driver’s favour at the previous grand prix in Canada but the world champion topped the timesheets in both practice sessions on Friday.Hamilton was 0.704sec quicker than Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo in second practice, while Vettel was only fifth fastest. The session included a 10-minute red flag period, caused when Sergio Pérez’s Force India lost a wheel at 150mph on the Mistral straight.Mercedes have fitted an upgraded, new specification engine and will expect to match and even better the step forward Ferrari made with their upgrade in Montreal.For McLaren the pressure to perform has proved testing already in France, especially for the racing director, Éric Boullier, who faced stern questions about his future with the team. Hoping to fight for podiums this season, the car has not been the step forward that was expected. Fernando Alonso’s fifth in Australia has been their best result.Boullier had to defend himself after reports of deep unrest in the team and that McLaren had given out 25p chocolate bars as a bonus to staff, one of whom reportedly described the atmosphere as “toxic” and that Boullier and other management figures were seen as “untouchable”.Boullier dismissed the affair as “chocolate-gate”, perpetrated by employees he described as merely “a couple of people who are grumpy”.He also insisted he would not be leaving. “We are all responsible for the car performance. No, I will not resign,” he said. “I’m in my 20th year in racing, I’ve won races and championships with every team I’ve managed before, including Formula One, so this is some record you cannot take away from me.”However while Boullier eventually tired of discussion of the topic he did throw doubt on McLaren’s expectations. The team had switched to Honda engines in 2015 in the belief they needed a works partnership to win. They dropped the manufacturer for Renault after three woeful seasons but Boullier suggested the former relationship was required to challenge at the top.“Red Bull is the proof that you can win races as a customer,” he said. “I think winning a championship is another level, you need to have a works team status.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man.

Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse.

Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e934a6d937f2e5c57a19d831f15803a7d337ae/0_466_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73b1e8f895372e1b53341465ae4aef8b","title":"boris becker insists diplomatic passport is genuine","story":"Former tennis star says he received document from Central African Republic’s ambassadorFormer world No 1 tennis player Boris Becker has insisted he has a genuine diplomatic passport from the Central African Republic after officials dismissed it as a fake.The retired German tennis star, who claims his role as an attache to the EU gives him diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy proceedings in the UK, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I have received this passport from the ambassador. I have spoken to the president on many occasions. It was an official inauguration. I believe the documents they are giving me must be right.”The three-times Wimbledon champion has faced a series of denials from CAR officials about the issue, including from the foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane. The presidential spokesman, Albert Yaloke Mokpeme, said the head of state never appointed Becker to the post.The presidency said: “We are not custodians of the physical and moral integrity of this gentleman.”Asked if he would be willing to go back to the CAR to sort out the controversy, Becker told the BBC: “I am very happy to visit Bangui, the capital, and to speak to the people personally about how we can move forward and resolve this misunderstanding and this confusion.“I have a real passport. It is at the embassy in Brussels the last time I checked.”Becker was appointed attache to the European Union on sporting, cultural and humanitarian affairs by the Central African Republic in April.His lawyers told a court in London last week that the position was covered by the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations and meant he could not be subjected to any legal proceedings without the consent of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and his counterpart in Bangui.He was declared bankrupt in June 2017 by registrar Christine Derrett. The bankruptcy was due to be discharged but Becker’s lawyers told the court he agreed to the suspension of the discharge so the issue of his diplomatic immunity could be investigated further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f34e9912f27a24a1e575bec98464cb235c63c7a0/0_37_4397_2638/master/4397.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d23958be33311547aa7a55736dfa034","title":"church england dabbing deacons jumping bishops ordination petertide","story":"Informal ordination photos may be a sign of holy joy for some, but traditionalists are less than elatedTheir souls are pure, their hearts are turned towards heaven and their future lies in a life of solemn devotion to God. But to the consternation of some of their more senior colleagues, a growing number of freshly ordained ministers of the Church of England are marking their new status by dabbing.As Petertide approaches – the run-up to St Peter’s Day on 29 June, and traditionally the time for Church of England ordinations – the Church Times and social media circles of the devout are braced for the usual avalanche of celebratory photographs of new members of the clergy. But the stern, decorous images that used to mark these occasions are being replaced by a trend for more frivolous action shots – with dabbing deacons showing up alongside priests leaping, baring their knees and even wearing L-plates. Their defenders see the new informality as a sign of holy joy. But hardcore traditionalists, along with casual curmudgeons, are less than elated.Their ire was recently roused by a shot of six readers being licensed at St Alban’s Cathedral, showing clear air under the heels of a jumping bishop of Hertford, the Rt Rev Michael Beasley.“What’s all this jumping for? It seems to have become a paraliturgical act and, as far as I can see, it is just nonsense that makes people look silly,” tweeted the Rev Patrick Gilday, rector of Benson with Ewelme in Oxfordshire.Arun Kataria, the communications officer at the diocese of St Albans, and proud taker of the photograph, disagreed. “Licensings and ordinations are serious occasions, but they are very joyful ones,” he told the . “So, there is a serious moment in the cathedral, where people are making the very big commitment of serving God and serving people, then there is also a tremendous release of joy, and a sense you are launched into a new life”.Capturing this launching, though, can be tricky. “You say: ‘Go!’ and they all jump at different speeds.” Pleased though he is is with his effort, he acknowledged: “I don’t think we are leading the field”.But Gilday, twice ordained “and never asked to jump up and down, of which I’m glad”, said it had become too widespread, an unofficial expectation and almost a ritual, without proper thought about what such images communicated. “I think it’s intended to communicate that we’re not all terribly boring, which we’re not,” he said. But he feared they looked artificial: “It connects with my general fear about the Church of England’s attempts to look really relevant in the modern world.”The Church Times editor, Paul Handley, expects a good crop this year. Last year’s Petertide ordinations yielded 10 “lightning bolt” deacons in Leicester, two hugging deacons in Sheffield and two knee-baring Durham ordinands, Simon Grundy and Danny Driver, leaping in front of the Angel of the North.“We probably encouraged the trend a bit, because in the old days we used to just publish lists of names and we asked the dioceses to send us photographs,” he said. Handley strives for a balance between the formal and the frivolous: “I think there is a bit of a competition to see who gets the cover photo. And the one that goes down best – or worst – is a group of ordinands jumping in the air. They have all been on an ordination retreat. So, it’s a bit like a cork out of the bottle”.A blog on the subject raised the issue that such photographs – and others such as the newly installed bishop of Oxford, Stephen Croft, wearing “L-plates” inside his cope – tended to downplay the solemnity of such occasions. While none of the images are “terrible” , collectively they served to give “an impression that we are uncomfortable with the more serious side of what we are doing”, wrote the author, an ordinand.In Leicester, where the deacons so enthusiastically dabbed, the diocesan mission and communications enabler, the Rev Jon Barrett, insists that there was no such dichotomy. “We always take our faith seriously, but try not to take ourselves too seriously,” he said.But Father Matthew Cashmore, assistant curate at West Hereford, who joined in the Twitter debate, said such images were “all a bit passe”.“Jumping ordinands. It’s probably good exercise, if nothing else,” he said. “Here we have this life-changing moment and you get this twee photographs of people jumping in the air and fists in the air. It’s become as staid and expected and as deeply uncreative as the images of the A-level results.”He agreed that collectively such images tended to downplay the solemnity of the occasion, and certainly did not appeal to the youth. “It’s all: ‘Yay!’ Smiley-facey.”Of dabbing deacons, he said: “I don’t think that connects with young people. As a millennial, I find that I walk round with my cassock, and I talk about mass, and I introduce myself as Father, and that’s far more impactful with millennials than standing there trying to be cool and with the kids. That ‘down with the kids’ stuff is kind of from the 80s anyway.“My generation would far rather somebody stand in front of them with some sort of honesty and integrity about what it is they believe than to be ‘Hey! Buddy Jesus. Big thumbs up.’”He prefered pictures showing the church’s beauty and emotional connection, he said. “So, happy, smiling faces that hold together the beauty of the buildings that these ordinations happen in, the stunning vestments, the incense. All of that stuff is beautiful and grabs people’s attention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06520a4b75ef5a51ea32aebce1b72ac3aaa47254/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5429bee3be81a213d73c66f88964aa8","title":"jogger detained us border cedella roman immigration ordeal","story":"It started as a leisurely jog along a Canadian beach on a cool spring evening. But it turned into a two-week nightmare after Cedella Roman accidentally veered across the US border and was seized by US border patrol agents.The French citizen was visiting her mother and studying English, when the family headed to White Rock, about an hour’s drive from Vancouver in May. As dusk approached, the 19-year-old went for a jog along the beach. She swerved on to a dirt path as the tide came in, stopping briefly to snap a photo of the stunning scenery before turning around to retrace her steps.It was then that she was confronted by two officers from the US border patrol.“An officer stopped me and started telling me I had crossed the border illegally,” Roman told Radio-Canada. “I told him I hadn’t done it on purpose, and that I didn’t understand what was happening.” She hadn’t seen any signs marking the border, she said. “I said to myself, well I may have crossed the border but they’ll probably only give me a fine, or they’ll tell me to go back to Canada or they’ll give me a warning.”Complicating matters was the fact that she didn’t have any government-issued ID or travel permits on her at the time. Noting that her steps had been captured on security cameras monitoring the area, the officers detained the teenager and accused her of crossing illegally into Blaine, Washington. She was transferred to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Centre, run by the Department of HomelandSecurity, more than 200km (125 miles) south of where she had been apprehended. Already the largest and most funded federal law enforcement agency in its own right, the border patrol is part of the umbrella agency US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP’s approximately 60,000 employees are split in four major isions: officers who inspect imports an air and marine ision agents who staff ports of entry – international airports, seaports and land crossings and the approximately 20,000 agents of the border patrol, who are concentrated in the south-west, but stationed nationwide.The border patrol enjoys extraordinary police powers. Agents operate checkpoints where they stop motorists everyday without suspicion, and in the interior of the country up to 100 miles, they can board planes, trains and buses. There is no geographic limit to which agents can otherwise conduct stops amid roving patrols, though they are technically required to have reasonable suspicion to do so. Extending from not only land borders but also the Pacific, Atlantic, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts, the 100-mile zone encompasses two out of every three Americans, 12 states in their whole or near entirety and nine of the 10 biggest cities in the nation.“They put me in the caged vehicles and brought me into their facility,” said Roman. “They asked me to remove all my personal belongings with my jewelry. They searched me everywhere.” The gravity of the situation began to sink in. “I understood it was getting very serious and I started to cry a bit.”Roman was able to contact her mother from the centre. Christiane Ferne rushed to the facility in a panic, bringing with her Roman’s passport and study permits. It wasn’t enough staff at the centre said the documents would have to be validated by immigration authorities in Canada before they could release Roman, according to Ferne. Two weeks passed before immigration officials in Canada and the US were able to confirm that Roman was eligible to return to Canada. Throughout it all, Ferne visited her daughter regularly at the centre. “It was just unfair that there was nothing, no sign at the border,” said Ferne. “It’s like a trap … anybody can be caught at the border like this.” Documents issued by the US government and shared with Radio-Canada confirmed that Roman was discharged on 6 June. The family said they were not sure if Roman will be allowed back in the US.  Immigration officials on both sides of the nearly 9,000km border refused to comment on Roman’s case, pointing to concerns over privacy. In a statement, US Customs and Border Protection noted that anyone who enters the US outside an official port of entry is considered to have crossed the border illegally. “This applies regardless of whether or not the inidual claims to have inadvertently crossed the border,” the department added.

In what is now turning into a battle of words between the US government and international observers, Alston hit back at criticisms that had been leveled at him the previous day by Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN.Haley complained that it was “patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America”. She accused the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights of political bias and wasting UN money by carrying out a six-month investigation into poverty and inequality in America, saying he should have focused instead on countries like Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Addressing delegations from 46 countries gathered in the chamber of the human rights council, Alston fired back that “when one of the world’s wealthiest countries does very little about the fact that 40 million of its citizens live in poverty, it is entirely appropriate for the reasons to be scrutinized”. He said that the “massive tax cuts” promoted by Trump would “overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy” while other policies pursued by the US government would stigmatize and punish millions of low-income Americans.In his most caustic comment, Alston threw back at Haley a term that she herself had used to deride the UN human rights council as a “cesspool of political bias”. Alston said that same council that he had seen with his own eyes real cesspools ­– in Alabama, during his tour of poverty hotspots in America.“I witnessed raw sewage poured into the gardens of people who could never afford to pay $30,000 for their own septic systems.” He added poignantly: “Cesspools need to be cleaned up, and governments need to act.”Such criticism of the world’s most powerful nation was all the more striking given the absence in the room. That morning, the chair normally occupied by the US delegation to the human rights council in Geneva was removed from the chamber following the decision of the Trump administration on Tuesday to withdraw from membership.The departure of the US makes it the only country to have pulled out of the world entity since the council was founded in 2006.Haley said the decision to depart was motivated by anger over the council’s perceived anti-Israeli bias, and about the continued membership within the body of human rights abusers such as Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But there was also growing speculation over whether the timing of the withdrawal had anything to do with Alston’s deeply critical report on poverty in America.Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, asked in a tweet: “Is it just a coincidence that the US withdraws from the UN Human Rights Council two days before it examines the Trump administration’s neglect of poverty in the United States?”Had the US delegation been present in the council for the hearing, they might have been forgiven for wincing at Alston’s presentation. He accused Haley of wanting to exempt the US from precisely the kind of international accountability over human rights that the Trump administration demanded for other countries.Turning to the findings of his tour of the US, he noted that maternal mortality rates among African Americans were now almost double those in Thailand. He cited new World Health Organisation data that shows that babies born in China today will live longer healthy lives than babies born in America.While accepting that the US economy was enjoying a period of growth, Alston said: “But the question is, who is benefiting. The benefits of economic growth are going overwhelmingly to the wealthy.”Most ominously, the UN monitor warned that the persistence of extreme poverty in the US would have a knock-on on the health of its democracy. He said such enduring problems “create ideal conditions for small elites to trample on the human rights of minorities, and sometimes even of majorities”.The warning was echoed by the ACLU, which told the human rights council that under Trump the US was suffering “the erosion of political participation. People living in poverty in the United States are being systematically deprived of their right to vote.”The ACLU’s Jennifer Turner referred to the more than 6 million Americans who have been disenfranchised as a result of felony convictions. One out of four African Americans in Kentucky, for instance, have been stripped of their votes as a result of felony disenfranchisement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540681.1529695841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish ferries yet to rearrange more than 800 bookings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  The delivery of the €147m LÉ ‘WB Yeats’ to Ireland had been delayed by German shipbuilder FSG.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireRyanair is cancelling flights this weekend because of a strike by French air traffic control (ATC) workers. In a statement the Irish airline said it expected “up to 100 flights” will have to be cancelled on Saturday and Sunday. So far the only Irish flight that has been confirmed as cancelled is the Dublin-Nice return flight on Sunday. The air traffic controller strike is also expected to cause “significant” delays to other flights both between and over France this weekend, due to what Ryanair described as “unjustified strike action.” A spokesman for Ryanair said: “All affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options: a full refund, rebooking on to the next available flight or transferring to an alternative flight.” The airline advised passengers flying with them over the weekend to check the status of their flights on Ryanair.Aer Lingus has also placed a warning on its website to advise passengers of “flight disruptions this weekend” due to the industrial action. The airline advised passengers flying this weekend to check the status of their flight online before heading to the airport.The airline said 16 of its 52 flights to and from France this week were at risk of disruption. It said Nice, Marseilles and Lyons were the affected airports. A total of 2,500 guests are currently booked to travel on these flights and could potentially be adversely impacted. Aer Lingus said in a statement: “Last weekend alone, eight Aer Lingus flights involving 1,115 guests were affected. Since April almost 3,500 guests have had their travel arrangements disrupted by air traffic control strikes in France and Italy. We pride ourselves on offering our guests a high quality, four star service, but that is extremely difficult to deliver in the face of such disruption.”It said if flights were cancelled, affected guests could opt to be accommodated on the next available flight, rebook their flight free of charge, or cancel and apply for a refund. In its statement, Ryanair called on the European Commission to take action to “prevent more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting the travel plans of Europe’s consumers this summer”.On Friday morning, staff shortages among French and German air traffic controllers caused delays to 42 Ryanair flights.

unique agricultural books sold auction","story":"digitalservices@telegraphRothamsted Manor, in the grounds of Rothamsted Research, near HarpendenA historic agricultural college is to sell off a unique collection of more than 3,000 ancient manuscripts amid fears they will be lost to the nation.The Rothamsted Collection was assembled between the two wars in the 1920s and 1930s by Sir John Russell and contains rare books relating to farming, livestock, landscape gardening and wine.Sir John had intended Rothamsted, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, to become a world-leading agricultural research centre but the concept never really took off and the books “became a bit of an anomaly,” one member of staff said.They have been sitting in the Lawes Agricultural Library gathering dust for decades, viewed only once or twice a year and are expensive to insure and maintain, with many tomes requiring controlled conditions, kept under lock and key.Peter Oxley, executive director of the Lawes Agricultural Trust, which is home to Rothamsted Research, said: “It has not been seen as something which is of use to us so the sale is a case of utilising an asset.”Concerns have been expressed that the collection should be maintained for the nation and that once sold to private collectors they will disappear forever from public view.Crescentiis (Petrus de) Ruralia commoda, a first edition of the first printed book on agricultureMr Oxley said the issue had been considered several times in recent years but that it had been decided that the Trust had its own objectives to fulfill which should be prioritised.The proceeds will be used to support its charitable activities, which include the provision of accommodation, land and buildings to Rothamsted Research.The institute is behind trials growing gene-edited super-crops in Britain,which aim to super-charge the plants to produce Omega 3 oils similar to those derived from fish.Rupert Powell, deputy chairman and head of books at Forum Auctions, said The Rothamsted Collection sale, which takes place over two days next month, had generated a lot of worldwide interest.“A collection like this does not come to the market too often,” he said. “It contains real curiosities and rarities. Our remit is to make as much money as possible for the vendor.”The sale contains books featuring the first published illustration of the tobacco plant, the first book devoted exclusively to potatoes, the first agricultural bibliography, the first gardening book for Scottish gardeners, the first bibliography on hunting and the first detailed description in English of wine-making in the Champagne region.Lot 4, the Augsburg-printed 1471 edition of Crescentiis’ Ruralia Commoda , which is the first printed book on agriculture, is expected to fetch up to £80,000.Exclusive: Defence minister reveals  his army veteran uncle killed himself, and calls for better mental health support for soldiersWhat caused the UK\u0026#39s carbon dioxide shortage?CO2 crisis will force shops to cut food sell-by dates amid panic-buying fearsEvicting criminals\u0026#39 families from council homes will help cut offending, says ministerPrince William\u0026#39s Middle East tour causes controversy as Palestinians claim it is \u0026#39indirect apology\u0026#39Princess Anne\u0026#39s love life to be explored in new series of the Crown French priest suspended after video of him slapping baby goes viralDame Vera Lynn breaks link with D-Day concert organisers after backlashEnergy firms failing to tell customers their smart meters will go \u0026#39dumb\u0026#39 when they switchWhite House accuses Democrats of exploiting toddler photo as Time magazine corrects storyComment: Greece has a lesson for Brexit Britain: If you\u0026#39re going to surrender to the EU, do it fastTeenager who Emmanuel Macron publicly reprimanded for calling him \u0026#39Manu\u0026#39 is \u0026#39upset and in hiding\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron doesn\u0026#39t understand the poor, says France\u0026#39s third richest man Space Force: Donald Trump\u0026#39s announcement of sixth branch of the armed forces \u0026#39surprised the Pentagon\u0026#39Perilous Khyber Pass to become four-lane express way to boost trade between Pakistan and Central Asia\u0026#39Special needs\u0026#39 farm takes on animals unwanted by other sanctuariesBen Nevis rescue team refuses to pick up climber who complained he had been caught in a downpourTrader who made £10m profit while \u0026#34practicing\u0026#34 sues a British firm for keeping the moneyWoman who helped peer compile the Animal Welfare Act admits string of cruelty charges involving horses, tropical birds and rabbitsVictory for Britain over Russia as inspectors could get power to blame states for chemical attacks We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/16/trans-religion-2.jpg","title":"trans rights christianity envangelicals lgbt religion prayer","story":"Created with Sketch.For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame\u0026nbspLGBT+\u0026nbsppeopleClick to followThe Independent OnlineEvangelicals assumed I was broken because of my gender identityOn Sunday afternoon I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown Washington, sipping coffee under a sliver of roof on a wet day, minding my own business, when three people who were clearly tourists walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The ancient grave also contained the skeletons of leopards, lynx,\u0026nbspbears, cranes and domestic animals.The creatures interred in the\u0026nbsptomb are thought to\u0026nbsphave belonged to Lady Xia, grandmother of the nation’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.Naming their find Junzi imperialis, the scientists said the discovery is particularly noteworthy given the total lack of gibbons in the region today.Dr Samuel Turvey, a conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London who made the discovery, told Science magazine that accounts of gibbons in central China are confined to the history books.“It is very, very far from any gibbon populations today,” he said.Dr Turvey came across the gibbon remains, which were first unearthed in 2004, while visiting the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology in Xi’an.British mammals’ fight for survivalThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years. The results reveal winners and losers, and highlight some of the key threat’s facing the country’s wildlife such as habitat loss, invasive species and the spread of diseases.Only one of these flying mammals has been recorded in the whole country, in a railway tunnel in West SussexThough not generally considered threatened animals, black rats number have collapsed in recent years due largely to pest control measures. However their far more common cousins, the brown rats, are thriving.Though it is difficult to measure changes in squirrel numbers,  their range has shrunk considerably due largely to the spread of squirrel pox virus by invasive grey squirrelThere has been a marked decline in wildcat populations, with only around 200 left in ScotlandThe banning of persistent organic pesticides has had a positive population effect on ottersThe 2018 review estimates a population size of fallow deer almost three times the size of that estimated in the 1995 review – a positive trend that is seen in other deer species.These aquatic mammals were nearly extinct in Europe at the start of the 20th century, but their reintroduction to the UK have been largely successfulThe Mammal Society’s assessment of Britain’s mammal populations is the first such review in over 20 years.

Its discovery was documented in the journal Science.Dr Thomas Geissmann, a gibbon expert at the University of Zurich, said the skull is a “fantastic find”, and could be the first evidence of many more gibbon species that used to inhabit this part of China.“I don’t doubt for a second that it’s a new species, and probably a new genus,” he said.Historical accounts and artwork from ancient China are full of references to gibbons, and could help scientists understand what the ape looked like when it was alive.Despite the reverence the ancient Chinese gave to these primates, it is likely that human expansion into the region’s expansive forests during this period spelled the end for its gibbon inhabitants.As forests are felled and agriculture expands, the gibbons’ habitat was probably whittled away, and the onset of a cooler, drier climate in central China at this time could have added to the pressure on its apes.Similar pressures still face gibbons today. In China, two species of these primates have disappeared recently, and the surviving representatives of the group are critically endangered.Scientists have warned that around 60 per cent of all primate species globally are threatened with extinction, including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.The Hainan gibbon, which inhabits the Chinese island it takes its name from, may be the rarest mammal in the world – with only around 26 iniduals remaining. The pressures facing these apes are similar to those that seemingly faced their ancient central Chinese cousins – human activity and habitat destruction.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Scientists claim to have just discovered the TRUTHSince the dawn of mankind, people have claimed to have been visited by ghosts, spirits and demons.Coincidentally, the majority of people will say that their paranormal experience had occurred in the dead of night.But scientists believe they have a more rational explanation for this now, and theorise that paranormal experiences are nothing to do with ghosts, but to do with one\u0026rsquos sleep patterns.Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths University, Alice Gregory, believes there are several ways in which sleep disruption can be confused with ghouls.                WATCH: Students \u0026lsquoPOSSESSED\u0026rsquo in Peruvian school                Spirit of 3,000 year old ancient Egyptian priest \u0026lsquocaught on camera\u0027One of the ways is through sleep paralysis \u0026ndash when you reach the deep sleep state, or REM state, where you become paralysed as to not act out your dreams.However, around eight percent of people retain some form of consciousness when they are in an REM state so it seems as if their dreams are transferred into real life and it could be misinterpreted as seeing people and things which are not actually there.Another possible explanation is something called exploding head syndrome where a loud bang is heard while you are drifting off, but there is no explanation for it.Prof Gregory says in an article for The Conversation: \u0026ldquoWhen we fall asleep, the reticular formation of the brainstem (a part of our brain involved in consciousness) typically starts to inhibit our ability to move, see and hear things.Sleep paralysis could be a reason for paranormal activity\u0026ldquoWhen we experience a \u0026lsquobang\u0026rsquo in our sleep this might be because of a delay in this process. Instead of the reticular formation shutting down the auditory neurons, they might fire at once.\u0026ldquoResearching my book, I spoke to Mrs Sinclair, who is 70, and lives alone.\u0026ldquoShe told me about what she had thought was a ghost living in her house, an imp throttling her during the night and other things that had left her petrified.\u0026ldquoHaving scientific explanations provided her with immense comfort and she no longer believes in paranormal explanations for the things that she experienced.Don\u0027t believe in ghosts? These pictures will be sure to change your mind.1 of 44\u0026ldquoOur hope is that scientific explanations of paranormal experiences might help others by lowering anxiety.\u0026ldquoDecreasing anxiety has also been hypothesised as a potential method by which to reduce sleep paralysis."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/590x/Lamb-978298.jpg","title":"face belgium mystic lamb revealed six hundred years","story":"AFPA close-up of the restored original of the \u0027Adoration of the Mystic Lamb\u0027 altarpieceAn ancient artwork, The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb is also one of the world\u0027s oldest oil paintings, created in 1432 by Jan and Hubert Van Eyck during the Flemish Primitives period.The large 15x10 panel piece, which features hinged panels depicting biblical scenes amongst daily life, is on display at St Bavo\u0027s Cathedral in Ghent.But for the past 600 years, tourists to the world-famous Norman cathedral have actually been ruminating over a completely different lamb\u0027s face to the original.The original was painted over to depict an impassive rather than neutral figure.Jacob Rees-Mogg scolds BBC host for \u0027straying into religious bigotry\u0027Summer Solstice IN PICTURES: Revellers gather at StonehengeRestoration project leader Helene Dubois told Flanders Today: The head is very different from what we\u0027ve known since the 16th century.

whole country.\u0026ldquoHigh pressure is extending across Britain bringing an easterly flow of warm air in from the Continent.\u0026ldquoIt is a very clean high meaning we are not expecting any air pollution or thundery outbreaks during this period.\u0026ldquoIt will continue to get warmer through next week with highs of 30C (86F) now expected on Tuesday and Wednesday.\u0026ldquoWith this we

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky. Sent in by Connor David, via email.Picture research: Alfie Snelling.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I love salad.”Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I’m totally neutral when it comes to politics.” (Dyed-in-the-wool BBC left-of-centre about everything).And Love Island, Alex on Megan revealing she’s a stripper: “I think that showed such character and strength.

We have also offered to meet with them.A team of more than 25 officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit have spent the past three years meticulously investigating Rikki’s murder.Assistant Chief Constable Paul Fullwood, who leads the three force Joint Protective Services, said: “It is disappointing that following our three year investigation we have not been able to identify the person or persons responsible for Rikki’s murder.“However, although at this stage we have no further active lines of enquiry we remain committed to finding his killer.  It is frustrating that despite three years of detailed investigations we are not able to tell Rikki’s family what happened on the day of his murder but we will not give up hope to do so one day.“Whether it be new evidence or advances in forensic science, we will utilise every opportunity to investigate this murder and bring an offender to justice.“We strongly believe someone out there knows the truth and remain hopeful that one day will come to light.The young boys mum, Ruth, was tried and acquitted of his murder in 1996 - she received a seven year jail sentence after pleading guilty to child neglect offences.The case was re-opened as a cold case in June 2015 by officers of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415114014.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may britain defence power","story":"It emerged that the PM has clashed with her Defence Secretary by questioning the need for the UK to continue to be a ‘Tier One’ power.The term means having a full spectrum of capabilities, from nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers to submarines and special forces.Pressed by The Sun to reassure worried generals, the PM refused to repeat the all-important Tier One term.Instead, she would only say: “The reports that you have read are not correct.“We will continue to be a leading defence nation.“The United Kingdom is a leading member of the NATO alliance.“We are the second biggest defence budget in NATO. We are the biggest defence budget in Europe.”Mrs May also insisted Britain will “continue to spend 2% of our GDP on defence” – the standing NATO cash target - while MPs have implored here to hike the MoD’s money to 3%.The Premier’s evasion rang immediate alarm bells among furious Tory MPs and only intensified fears of a bitter new round of defence cuts.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is locked in a struggle with Chancellor Philip Hammond for more money to fill a £20bn blackhole in the defence budget.Former Army-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer said: “If the PM thinks that we are no longer going to be a Tier One military nation, then she will have a serious disagreement with me and a number of other Conservative backbenchers.“It is unthinkable that she would want Britain’s role in the world to diminish.“I will be pressing the PM for clarification of what this would mean for an already heavily pressurised defence budget.”The Sun can also reveal that Downing Street has demanded military chiefs bury a report on the spiralling security threats to Britain in a bid to keep a lid on calls for more defence cash.Mrs May and Mr Hammond have ordered Mr Williamson not to publish findings of an MoD funding review that highlight the new danger Russia poses until at least December.That is a month after fresh money is handed out to other departments such as health in the Budget in November.Mr Stoltenberg said: “Some question the bond between Europe and the US.But we’ve had differences before. The lesson of history is we overcome those differences.”The Defence Secretary had pledged to unveil the work in time for NATO’s annual summit next month.A senior defence source said: “No10 and No11 just want this to all go away, because they’ve spent any money we could have had on the NHS.Mrs May spoke as she met NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in No10 for talks to halt Donald Trump from walking out on the transatlantic alliance.Fears are also mounting that the US President will use its annual get-together to announce a devastating American withdrawal of military support until the other 28 members start stumping up more cash for their defence budgets.Pleading for military spending to increase across Europe, Mr Stoltenberg said: ““What makes NATO unique is the bond between Europe and America.

He spent his last days at St Christophers Hospice, where he died in 1995.Saunders died of cancer at the age of 87 in 2005 at the hospice she had founded.In 1998, the search engine founders Larry and Sergey drew a stick figure behind the second o of Google as a message to that they were out of office at the Burning Man festival and with that, Google Doodles were born.The company decided that they should decorate the logo to mark cultural moments and it soon became clear that users really enjoyed the change to the Google homepage.In that same year, a turkey was added to Thanksgiving and two pumpkins appeared as the os for Halloween the following year.Now, there is a full team of doodlers, illustrators, graphic designers, animators and classically trained artists who help create what you see on those days.Among the Doodles published in past months were designs commemorating German scientist Robert Koch, Jan Ingenhousz (who discovered photosynthesis) and the 50th anniversary of kids coding languages being introduced.And the search giant celebrated the 2017 Autumn Equinox , which marked the official ending of summer and the coming of autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"eu citizens are our friends family and colleagues and are welcome post brexit minister promises","story":"Revealing the Home Offices plan to register EU nationals after we leave the EU, Caroline Nokes insisted yesterday that the new system would be easy and straightforward for anyone to use.She told MPs in the House of Commons that up to four million EU citizens would be welcome to stay after Brexit, and would be able to bring over their spouse, family or even a girlfriend or boyfriend if they had been together more than two years.Ms Nokes said: EU citizens make a huge contribution to our economy and our way of life, they are our friends, family and colleagues and we want them to stay.Ministers insisted that they are working hard on delivering the system on mobile devices, so citizens can simply scan and upload documents to their phone and snap a selfie to prove who they are. It is hoped it will be ready in just a few months, so they can have years to prepare everyone for our EU exit.They will have to pay £65 in order to register and stay here - which is cheaper than the price of a British passport.He told a Lords committee today that minister want to make it as simple as possible and might not involve any paperwork having to be sent in to them.Mr Javid said. You have an app, you can put your passport next to your phone, and it will download your information.Then you can take a selfie - Im sure youve done that many times - you download it too, and match the information downloaded with the chip and confirm it electronically.Other details like National Insurance numbers would be taken through the app and cross referenced with existing information.But he also had to admit that there was an issue at the moment with whether it would work on iPhones, because of problems with Apples technology.However, ministers are working on the issue with Apple, and hope to get it resolved in time for the apps launch in the autumn.Mr Javid said he wanted trials to start in July with a full roll out following a few months later.And for those less tech savvy EU citizens, Mr Javid said they would be setting up shop in libraries and local council buildings to help register people in person too.Theresa May has already agreed that the millions of EU nationals living in the UK can remain for life – if they apply for settled status.Ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd in April said the residency application system would be “as easy” as setting up an online account at luxury brand LK Bennett.Yesterday Sajid Javid said he would be looking for reasons “to grant, not refuse” a right to remain.The scheme offers more “generous” rights than first planned- and better terms to those awarded to British nationals with foreign partners.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said answers will be checked and decisions given “very quickly”. There would have to be “a very good reason” for refusal.But critics accused ministers of giving in too much to the EU.Alp Mehmet, of the Migration Watch think tank said: “The government seem to have conceded almost every point demanded by the EU.“Meanwhile there is very little evidence that EU member states have done anything to speak of for British residents in their countries.”A row over criminal checks threatened to block the entire withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU last year. The Home Office yesterday insisted background checks would only be carried out where they had concerns.Tory backbencher Philip Davies called for more clarity from the Home Office. He said: “It seems to me the presumption is the wrong way round. My view is that if anyone commits a crime they should be booted out.“Being in this country is a privilege.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415246547.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roma travellers claim hull like holiday","story":"The Roma gypsies arrived on Wednesday from Appleby in Cumbria and are made up of five families with over a dozen children in six caravans.They have set up their camp on grassland close to residential properties and have even strung their washing up between trees.One member of the group - Colleen Price, 30, said: “We like Hull.

Shes a remarkable woman. Were moving forward and hopefully going to get married next year. The children are really happy.The dad-of-two heard everything as wife Nicola was tragically stabbed to death by a schizophrenic home invader as she protected their kids Stanley, six, and Isabella, three.Mr Cross, an IT specialist, was working away from home at the time and 200 miles away in Hull when, during a phone call with Nicola, he heard her desperate fight for life.He appeared on the latest series of Channel 4s SAS: Who Dares Wins, in which ex-Special Forces soldiers put recruits through a gruelling recreation of the SAS selection process.The 40-year-old had ex-Special Forces hardmen Jason Fox and Ant Middleton in tearful silence as he revealed the harrowing details of that night.Marcin Porczynski, then 27 and a schizophrenic, broke into the familys home late at night intending to kidnap their two young children while Mr Cross was working in Hull.Reliving the night of his wifes death, he said today: Nikki just called me late in the evening and said she was worried about somebody outside the house and the police had been earlier.The children were in bed at the time, Stanley was six and Isabella was three. So we were discussing options on the phone, what to do. But before she could do anything, the guy broke in through the back doors and killed her.I heard it all down the phone. Its complete shock, you dont know whats going on. I felt utterly heartless. I was on the phone to the police on the other line, trying to relay information.I didnt know what had happened to the children till I heard them crying on the phone and then I thought they were OK.Mr Cross said after the killing he and his two kids moved in with his parents but he returned to his former home occasionally so he could let out his emotions in private.He underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flash backs within the first month after Nicola died.I felt like I couldnt breathe, I was back in that moment and then I realised if Im going to be a good dad to the kids and make sure theyre confident, happy adults then I need to get help, he said.In January this year Mr Cross revealed he was doing really well and had found love again with 27-year-old Alex.Discussing his new relationship he said: She came in and sort of let everything wash over her. Its a brave decision to get involved with a family thats had something like that happen to them.Shes been perfect with the children. [In her job] she specialises in under fives but she can do things with the kids, techniques and things, that I dont know anything about.Its been amazing, quite freaky really, to have someone come in whos so perfect.Porczynski pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court in December 2016 to Nikkis manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack and had been hearing voices for up to two years before the killing.Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun or call us direct on 02077824220.We pay for videos too.

they arrived at the event earlier this week.The newlyweds arrived in a horse-drawn carriage alongside the Count and Countess of Wessex.They were followed swiftly by the Queen, wearing a bright yellow jacket and matching hat, who was accompanied by her daughter, Princess Anne.Meghan, wearing a elegant white dress and Harry in top and tails, waved to excited crowds who had packed out the race course in Berkshire.Their appearance at the eagerly anticipated race event came hours after Kensington Palace announced that their first official foreign trip as a couple would be to Dublin, in July. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were also spotted arriving at Royal Ascot with Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice travelling in another carriage, after.Missing from the royal party was Zara Phillips

booze-fuelled antics, with video footage emerging of a mass brawl between men at Ascot in May.The incident took place a week after another man was filmed being kicked in the head during a fight at Goodwood races in Sussex.Goodwood chiefs are so sick of the bad behaviour that they have limited punters to buying fours drinks one time.However, it is not thought that Ascot has taken similar measures. Meghan has appeared comfortable in filling her new role as a royal, having taken on her first event without Prince Harry.The American visited Cheshire with The Queen earlier this month,

Mississippi.Capt. Ray Boggs of the Stone County Sheriff’s Department recounted what was said at a preliminary hearing on Wednesday .According to the Sun Herald, he said: “(Johnson) told me that he beat her up real bad.“He said it got out of hand.”Using a butter knife, Johnson allegedly sliced his mother’s throat and then used his teeth and bare hands to remove her head, claimed Boggs.Johnson also claimed he choked her unconscious first during a fight over credit cards.When cops arrived at the Johnson home June 6 — to conduct a welfare check on Sherry at the request of her two brothers and sister, who hadn’t heard from the 51-year-old since June 3 — they found her mutilated body in the garden.Her head had been tossed over a fence.Johnson — an Army vet who was expelled by the Department of Veterans Affairs after a prior arrest — allegedly confessed to everything, though it’s unclear when his mother’s murder took place.A grand jury must now decide whether he should be formally charged.Johnson’s lawyer, Jim Davis, told reporters that he is currently weighing the possibility of an insanity defence.He said: “(Johnson) does have a substantial history and you all heard details of the case.“That’s not a normal homicide … (but) we’ve got to wait until we get the records and probably have him properly evaluated.“Then, we’ll kind of know where we’re headed.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415382034.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"st pauls girls school hammersmith london austerity day baked potato lunch","story":"St Pauls Girls School in Hammersmith, West London, was accused by a former pupil of showing utter contempt with the exercise that resulted in money going to local charities.The prestigious school, which counts Susanna Reid and Rachel Weisz as former pupils, usually serves the likes of seared cod, slow-cooked Moroccan lamb and duck leg confit, appeared to delete a post on Twitter about the austerity lunch.The post, which was screen-grabbed and shared, said: Today was the final Austerity Day of the year.Students and staff had baked potatoes, with beans and coleslaw, for lunch, with fruit for dessert.The money saved will be donated to the schools charities.The post included pictures of the food described, as well as an image of what appears to be the arm of a butler or waiter lifting a lid from a platter containing just three peas.Henna Shah, 24, a former bursary student at the school, said: I am incredibly grateful to have gone to a school that has given me opportunities someone like me would never have had otherwise.Yet I recognise that few people like me get the chance to have an education like this on a bursary scheme like I did.I am highlighting this now because this is not about pulling the ladder up behind me - I joined the Labour party and work in politics now precisely because everyone deserves the best quality education.It is upsetting to see that on a day that is meant to be about compassion, the way it was presented showed utter contempt.Austerity is not about eating jacket potatoes once a term, it is about not being able to afford anything else.A menu on the school website, for a week in May, gave a flavour of what is usually on offer for lunch at the school.Pupils tucked into delights such as Malaysian snapper Curry with okra and tomato, warm chicken and asparagus Caesar Salad, and plum and blackcurrant sponge.According to the schools website, the fee per term for the academic year 2017-2018 is £7,978, and for new entrants to the senior school (Year 12) the fee per term is £8,577.The school fee includes lunch, the website said.Susanna Reid - TV presenterA food section on the website says: Everyone knows teenage girls can be picky eaters, so we try to give them lots of choice.We regard the enjoyment of good and healthy food as a priority and lunch at St Pauls is a real highlight of the day.In a statement, the school said: For many years, along with many schools and places of worship in the country, St Pauls has arranged regular lunches when simple food is served and the money saved given to local charities.The aim is also to raise the awareness of our students to those less fortunate than themselves.We take our commitment to the wider community very seriously.The choice of the word austerity is to draw attention to the fact that others around them are facing significant economic difficulties.A Twitter account called @everydayhunger wrote: Can they really be unaware that for families living in poverty today, this austerity meal is completely out of reach?Maybe they should visit their local food bank to see what genuine poverty rations look like.Twitter user Georgia OBrien wrote: One of the countrys leading independent schools holding an Austerity Day where students eat what is basically amounts to a standard state school dinner."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415261128.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince andrew royal navy initiation pictures","story":"The young officer was made to take part in a Crossing the Line ceremony to mark the first time he passed the equator as a seaman in 1982.The ritual involved a crew member of HMS Invincible dressing up as Neptune -

Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith is expected to back Trident, call for more money for the military and attack Theresa May for starving defence of cash when she addresses the Royal United Services Institute think tank on Monday. A source said: “In government the Tories have slashed defence spending, cut the size of the Army and are giving a raw deal to our servicemen and women. “Labour wants to see proper investment in defence and a decent pay rise for our men and women who have had to endure seven years of real terms pay cuts since 2010, despite rising rents in service accommodation and cuts to tax credits.”  The Prime Minister is under mounting pressure after she threw into doubt Britain’s status as a tier one military power. It is widely taken to mean a country which has a full spectrum of military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, special forces, a navy, army and air force capable of being deployed anywhere in the globe. She pointedly refuse to use the phrase when challenged this week, despite standing next to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in No 10. With the Army about 5,000 below its manpower target and repeated warnings about expensive equipment such as new stealth fighter jets and armoured vehicles widening the black hole in the defence budget, Labour believes the Tories are vulnerable over defence. This year’s Armed Forces Continuous Attitudes Survey, slipped out last month(MAY, revealed 35% of personnel are dissatisfied with Service life amid plunging morale.  Just 31% of troops are satisfied with their pay, a drop of 52% compared with when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Ms Griffith’s speech to RUSI comes in the week of Armed Forces Day and ahead of next month’s(JULY) crunch NATO summit in Brussels where Donald Trump is expected to rap allies for failing to pump enough cash into their military. She was appointed to the tricky Shadow Defence Secretary post in October 2016 amid renewed scrutiny of Labour’s policies for the Armed Forces.

A Tory Brexit is dangerously bad for British jobs.       One of our foremost manufacturers, Airbus, has warned that without frictionless access to our European Union markets, it cannot see a future in the UK.       From the home of Concorde in Bristol, to Portsmouth and Newport, to Stevenage and Scotland, Airbus sustains 100,000 manufacturing and related jobs.      While the impact of any Airbus exit will fall heaviest on 6000 Broughton workers in North Wales, thousands more in the supply chain hang in the balance. There is not a part of the country that won’t suffer.         Yet the fate of these workers now lie in the hands of a squabbling Tory party.       It has been two years since the Brexit vote - but we are no further forward today in understanding where this government is taking us in March 2019 than we were in June 2016.       At this rate, hemmed in by the Tories’ destructive red lines, all the signs are that we will crash out without a deal.       So when the government breezily says that it is confident that it will get a deal that will meet the need of Airbus and manufacturers like them, who are they trying to kid?      People are not fools.  Yes, there was a vote to leave the EU – and that must be respected - but it was not a vote to lose our jobs.

The Office funnyman was called out in a parliamentary debate and accused of stigmatising the disease. MP Steve Brine criticised Gervais for an old gag where he allegedly described ME as “the one where...‘I don’t feel like going to work today’. The Minister for Primary Care said: We recognise that people with ME have encountered significant stigma, in part due to the unfavourable media representations of the condition that not only go back to the 1980s but have continued in recent times Mr Brine used the the offensive joke as an example, telling MPs : I have to say that Ricky Gervais is a very talented comic but given that he’s quite active on Twitter, maybe he could just be asked to retract that and apologise to the ME community for that comment today on Twitter.”  The minister was speaking during a three-hour parliamentary debate on the lack of funding for medical research into ME. Politicians called for controversial psychotherapy and exercise therapies recommended by the NHS after a \u0027flawed\u0027 medical trial must stop because it is making patients worse.  They called for an end to stigma and myths surrounding ME. Westminster Hall was told how people with ME are more than six times likely to commit suicide. ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) affects 250,000 people in the UK, with tens of thousands left bedbound, housebound and unable to work. Sufferers have had to face barbs of laziness and hysteria after the illness was dubbed ‘Yuppie Flu’ in the 1980s. Carol Monaghan (SNP, Glasgow North West) told the debate how ME costs the UK \u0026pound3.3bn per year. She said: “Despite the number of people affected, and the devastating affect this disease has on suffers and indeed, their families, it is very much a hidden illness. “Characterised as ‘yuppie flu’, and misunderstood by doctors and politicians alike, it receives little funding, and treatment is often damaging.” "},{"url":null,"title":"11 best spots uk watch","story":"Advertorial11 best spots in the UK to watch an amazing sunset this summerThis week marks the summer solstice – and is also the official start of summer.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting.  1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland   A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer.  Bike need replacing?       If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90).  And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear.  Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:   Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables   2. The Eden Project, Cornwall      Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.   Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination.   Camping out?      Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch.  Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail.   Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends.   For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.      3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales   The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm.  Why not try..       The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.         4. White Nancy, Cheshire      Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week.  Need to drive?     Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first.  A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips.

With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.   5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland   There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm.  6. Hampstead Heath, London   The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.        7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight      The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.   Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier.   If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green !  The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.     8. Ness Point, Lowestoft          Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down.  Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.     9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire      With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.     10. Cotswolds, England   Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm     Find your way by car - and beat the traffic       If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).         11.

Auzair Hussain reduced his girlfriend to a shadow of herself during a campaign to control her while they were both students at Cardiff politan University. From January to March last year, 24-year-old Hussain assaulted the French national on numerous occasions and whipped her with a belt and coat hanger. He controlled a number of aspects of his girlfriend’s life including the clothes and make-up she wore, what she ate, when she could shower, and who she was allowed to speak to while he also prevented her from speaking in her mother tongue and from contacting friends and family. He also hated her laughing and made her be quiet when she was in his presence.  A sentencing hearing at Newport Crown Court on Friday heard Hussain first attacked his victim after he saw her smoking a cigarette and she declined to hold his hand in public. It was at this stage he used the belt and hanger to whip his girlfriend, including her chest and private areas. On another occasion, after she looked at a LinkedIn account of a former boyfriend, Hussain threw her about, punched and kicked her, and strangled her before trashing her room. He told his terrified victim – who feared for her life and was so scared she wet herself – he would not hit her in the head because the head is for slapping. After another argument was started by the defendant, he punched and kicked his girlfriend and forced her to strip naked.  Straight after the assault Hussain went to the gym but complained his bench pressing had been affected by hand injuries sustained during the beating. She was later forced to massage his hands to soothe his injuries. Hussain, of Birmingham, was later convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour and assault occasioning ABH and he pleaded guilty to a count of assault occasioning ABH. In a statement read out to the court by prosecutor Sarah Waters, his victim said she felt destroyed as a person as a result of the relationship in which she felt trapped. She described the defendant as being extreme in everything he did and of pushing her beyond her boundaries. She said: I think it’s difficult for anyone who has not been in a controlling relationship to understand why I stayed with him but retrospectively I hate myself for being a coward and not running away. What should have been one of the best years of my life studying abroad turned into a nightmare.

Keith Ballard, 31, fled to Poland with a new girlfriend during his trial at Warwick Crown Court. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison in his absence for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his young son Jake, and cruelty by failing to get him emergency medical aid, Birmingham Live reports.  His then-partner, baby Jake’s mother Sharon Herbert was convicted of cruelty by neglecting him in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering by failing to get prompt treatment for him. When Ballard, of Coventry, failed to turn up, Judge Sally Hancox, issued a warrant for his arrest.  She was told a European arrest warrant would be applied for once he was convicted – but in fact, that application was not finalised until more than a week after the guilty verdicts. In the meantime, it emerged at Birmingham Crown Court, where Judge Hancox is now sitting, that the police had contacted Ballard’s new partner to tell her of the situation – and when she confronted him, he had got into his car and drove off. Concluding that there was no prospect that he will be found soon, Judge Hancox jailed him in his absence for 16 years for causing Jake’s injuries, with a consecutive two-year term for failing to get prompt medical attention. She ordered that when he is finally caught, he should be brought before her to be told of the sentence, and to be sentenced for absconding. Herbert, 33, of Coventry, was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years, with a 30-day rehabilitation activity.  Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said Jake, born in August 2015, was a normal healthy baby, with no sign of abnormality, after which routine screening showed him developing normally. He said: At midnight on the 9th of September, while at home in the sole care of his father Keith Ballard, Jake collapsed into a state of encephalopathy, damage to the brain affecting the function of the brain. Mr Ballard woke his partner Sharon Herbert, the child’s mother, who at the time was asleep in bed, and took Jake to her. She later said she knew immediately something was seriously wrong with Jake, whose condition she described as scary. There is consensus among medical experts that he would have been frighteningly unwell, and would have been frighteningly unwell at the point he sustained the injuries. Yet neither defendant called for an ambulance. Mr Hankin said after a delay of at least 10 minutes, Ballard called 111, the NHS non-emergency helpline, but even then he deliberately concealed the fact that Jake had collapsed. He merely described the 27-day-old baby as being a bit floppy when he got up to feed him – and Mr Hankin said Herbert had been a party to that misdescription.

Charles Howeson, 68, used his qualities, advantages and power to act as a sexual predator towards young men while in three separate roles between 1985 and 1994. He was convicted of 10 indecent assaults against eight young men during that period, following a trial at Bristol Crown Court last year. The court heard he was the effective captain of HMS Cleopatra in 1985 and groped a junior member of crew on an unlit deck. A Royal Navy inquiry was launched after the victim, and a second man who reported Howeson for touching his stomach and tugging at his shirt, complained. Judge Mark Horton said senior officers associated with Howeson effectively closed ranks and put his interests, and the reputation of the Navy, above those whom it should have been protecting. Howeson was given a formal warning by the Royal Navy and never commanded a ship of the fleet again - though was promoted - and retired in 1990.  He then worked as a chief executive at a charity in Plymouth, where he indecently assaulted six volunteers in dark tunnels on Drake\u0027s Island and dark rooms. Complaints were made but the allegations were not reported to police to save the reputation of the trust, the judge said, and Howeson was allowed to resign. Following his resignation, Howeson saw a further opportunity to manipulate and assault another young man. The judge ordered Howeson, of Craigie Drive, Plymouth, to pay prosecution costs of \u0026pound50,000 and sign the sex offenders register indefinitely. This case has revealed that to the outside world you displayed the finest qualities of diplomacy, charisma, endeavour, organisation and charm which you demonstrated during your period in the Navy and in your extensive and successful career and involvement at the very highest level with public bodies, authorities, businesses including a bank but also in your public and charitable works mainly associated with the community of Plymouth, the judge told Howeson. The hidden and dark truth is these same qualities were the very qualities which enabled you to mask and conceal a dark secret only revealed for the world to see some 30 years later in this trial. That secret was your uncontrolled and predatory sexual behaviour particularly towards young or at least vulnerable men under your control. Between 1985 and 1994, in three separate roles in your professional life, you used all of your qualities, advantages and power to use and abuse your position to enable you to act as a sexual predator. In most cases you effectively trapped them like prey in order to abuse them.

War hero Bill Speakman was just 24 when he fought off a sustained attack from 6,000 Chinese and North Korean solders for more than four hours in 1951, despite receiving a shrapnel wound in his leg. The 6ft 6in soldier, known as ‘Big Bill’, pelted enemy soldiers with grenades until they ran out. He then hurled rocks, tins and even empty beer bottles at them. He was given a hero’s welcome by thousands of people on the streets of his hometown of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, when he returned a year later. Speakman became the first man to receive a Victoria Cross from Queen Elizabeth II for outstanding bravery, and was one of only a handful of living holders of the award.  Despite his great height and courage, he was known as a modest and quiet man who struggled to adjust to civilian life and the celebrity which followed his great investiture. Born on September 21, 1927, Bill was raised by a single mum and started his military career when he was 17, serving in Germany, Italy and Hong Kong with the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland. He transferred to the King’s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) as a private when British troops mobilised for Korean service in 1950.  His regiment was bombarded with shell and mortar fire in the early hours of November 4, 1951 as they defended a position on Maryang San in Korea, but Speakman fought back with grenades and beer bottles sent to the line for consumption by the platoon, breaking up several enemy attacks. His charge against the enemy allowed his overrun troops enough time to evacuate their wounded. Talking of the life-or-death seige, he said: “It was hand-to-hand. There was no time to pull back the bolt of the rifle. “It was November, the ground was hard, so grenades bounced and did damage.”  Recalling the moment he was handed the award, he said: “When I got it The King [George VI] was alive but he was very ill. “He awarded me the VC and then he died. So The Queen – I was her first VC. It was a wonderful moment. I think she was nervous and I was very nervous.” The announcement of the Victoria Cross award said: “Private Speakman’s heroism under intense fire throughout the operation and when painfully wounded was beyond praise and is deserving of supreme recognition.” "},{"url":null,"title":"miracle baby due christmas day","story":"NewsMiracle baby due on Christmas Day will share birthday with tragic big brother they will never meetArlene Smith was stunned to find the due date for her IVF baby is the \u0027most special day of the year\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmanda KeenanBradley Jolly17:33, 22 JUN 2018Updated17:49, 22 JUN 2018NewsArlene Smith\u0027s son Jack died suddenly from a rare virus (Image: Daily Record WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A miracle baby due on Christmas Day will share a birthday with the tragic big brother they will never get to meet.

They found the number of people underestimating their size has grown alongside the body-positivity movement. Analysis showed 58% of overweight men thought in 2015 they were slimmer than they really were, up from 48% in 1997. The same applied to 31% of women, compared with 25% in 2015.  People underestimating their size were 85% less likely to try to slim down. Prof Dr Raya Muttarak, University of East Anglia, said: “Seeing the potential of the fuller-sized market, retailers may have contributed to normalisation of being overweight and obese. “While [the] body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.

Former pupils of St Paul\u0027s Girls\u0027 School in Hammersmith, west London, said it showed utter contempt for describing jacket potatoes with beans and coleslaw as an austerity meal today. The exercise, which saw money go to charities, has also led to widespread criticism on social media. The prestigious school usually serves its 700 students the likes of seared cod, slow-cooked Moroccan lamb and duck leg confit for lunch. But it altered its lavish menu for the day and donated the money saved to charity.  In a tweet which appears to have been deleted, the school said: Today was the final Austerity Day of the year. Students and staff had baked potatoes, with beans and coleslaw, for lunch, with fruit for dessert. The money saved will be donated to the school\u0027s charities.   But Henna Shah, 24, a former St Paul\u0027s student, said: I am incredibly grateful to have gone to a school that has given me opportunities someone like me would never have had otherwise. Yet I recognise that few people like me get the chance to have an education like this on a bursary scheme like I did. I am highlighting this now because this is not about pulling the ladder up behind me — I joined the Labour party and work in politics now precisely because everyone deserves the best quality education.         Henna, of Hounslow, west London, added: It is upsetting to see that on a day that is meant to be about compassion, the way it was presented showed utter contempt. Austerity is not about eating jacket potatoes once a term, it is about not being able to afford anything else. And a Twitter account called @everydayhunger wrote: Can they really be unaware that for families living in poverty today, this \u0027austerity\u0027 meal is completely out of reach? Maybe they should visit their local food bank to see what genuine poverty rations look like. Twitter user Georgia O\u0027Brien wrote: One of the country\u0027s leading independent schools holding an \u0027Austerity Day\u0027 where students eat what is basically amounts to a standard state school dinner. Pupils at the school usually tuck into delights such as Malaysian snapper Curry with okra and tomato and warm chicken and asparagus Caesar Salad.  According to the school\u0027s website, the fee per term for the academic year 2017-2018 is \u0026pound7,978, and for new entrants to the senior school (Year 12) the fee per term is \u0026pound8,577. The school fee includes lunch, the website said. A food section on the website says: Everyone knows teenage girls can be picky eaters, so we try to give them lots of choice.

The children are really happy, he told BBC Three Counties Radio .  Nikki, 37, was brutally killed in September 2015 as she tried to protect her two children Stanley, six, and Isabella, three, from 25-year-old Marcin Porczynski who had broken into their home in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.  Dan, 40, was at work 200 miles away in Hull when he heard Nicola\u0027s screams down the phone as she pleaded for her life before she was stabbed 10 times.

We had discussed what would happen if one of us died young. Nikki said \u0027I want you to be happy. I want you to find someone else, someone that can look after the kids\u0027. I was the clown and would say \u0027If I die young, I want you to wear black for the rest of your life and never meet anyone else\u0027. We had the conversation so every day from the day Nikki died decision making was always based around what would Nikki do, what would Nikki want and we still do that today.  Nikki wanted me to be happy. She wanted the children to be happy. She was that type of person and that gives me confidence knowing I\u0027m doing the right thing. I honestly believed for a long time that I would never meet anybody else and then gradually things changed and I began to realise that I didn\u0027t want to be on my own for the rest of my life and I knew what Nikki wanted for me.

We have to keep moving forward as well as holding onto that nice bit of the past. We do, obviously, have our daily issues that we need to address around the event of what happened to Nikki and that will continue, but in general we are a positive family and we\u0027ll keep being so.

Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Dan explained how counselling has helped him and his children to deal with the trauma.  He said: Stanley was six and Isabella was three at the time, I was telling her to leave and go to my mum and dad\u0027s but before she could leave he broke through the back doors and killed her. I didn\u0027t know what happened to the children until I heard them crying on the phone, and knew they were okay. Dan and his children moved in with his parents after the horrific night, but he returns to his former home sometimes so he can let out his emotions in private and feel closer to Nikki.  Dan underwent trauma counselling afterwards and said he experienced flashbacks within the first month after Nicola died.

Nigel Ingram, 57, and John Blight, 58, were found guilty of failing to disclose more than 100 items of unreported wreck from the HMS Hermes in the English Channel - including a torpedo hatch, launch panels and chinaware. The two men were found at the location of the HMS Hermes by French maritime officers on Tuesday September 30 2014. Ingram was still in the water at the time, having dived from Blight’s boat called De Bounty. Although no offences were identified at the time officers were suspicious of the lifting equipment on the boat, resulting in an underwater exploration of the Hermes three days later.  HMS Hermes was a protected cruiser built in the late 19th century and converted into an aircraft ferry and depot ship ready for the start of the First World War. It was sunk by a German submarine in the Dover Strait in October 1914, causing the loss of 44 British lives. After the exploration a criminal investigation was launched by the French authorities and later referred to Kent Police, resulting in the arrests of Ingram and Blight on Monday October 19, 2015. More than 100 items of unreported wreck were recovered at Ingram’s home along with approximately \u0026pound16,000 cash.  A number of photographs were also located on his computer, one of which showed the condenser of the Hermes on the back of De Bounty approximately four hours after it had been boarded by the French surveillance officers. Police established through subsequent enquiries that Ingram had cashed a cheque from a scrap merchant for \u0026pound5,029 the day after, on Wednesday, October 1 2014. Also seized from Ingram’s home was a notebook entitled ‘De Bounty, Diver Recovery’ that contained details of what dives were undertaken and the items recovered, including the condenser. The total value of the wreck collected was estimated at being more than \u0026pound150,000.  None of the items listed were reported to the Receiver of Wreck as they should have been. Ian Hope, prosecuting, said the pair hauled huge pieces of wrecks from the seabed using winching equipment on Mr Blight\u0027s boat. They deliberately and dishonestly failed to declare them to the authorities, as they were legally obligated to do, On Friday June 22 2018 both men were found guilty of fraud relating to their failure to disclose recovered items in order to make a financial gain, following a two-week trial at Canterbury Crown Court. Ingram, from Teynham, Kent was subsequently jailed for four years and Blight from Winchelsea, East Sussex for three-and-a-half years. Investigating officer PC Anne Aylett, of Kent Police, said: The HMS Hermes and other shipwrecks of its kind are legally protected for a reason, and that is because they form an important part of the history of this country.  Nigel Ingram and John Blight have demonstrated a complete disregard for the law by helping themselves to artefacts that should have remained beneath the sea instead of being brought to the surface and sold for scrap metal. We are proud of our close working relationship with our partner agencies, which in this case included the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Marine Management Organisation, the Receiver of Wreck, Sussex Police, Historic England, Crown Prosecution Service and the French authorities, and take a robust approach to ensuring important historical items do not end up in the hands of people who are not entitled to them. We will continue to investigate anyone suspected of stealing items from sunken wrecks and seek to prosecute them when appropriate. Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime and policing advice for Historic England, said: All archaeological sites underwater comprise a finite, irreplaceable and fragile resource, vulnerable to damage and destruction through human activity.

Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, travelled more than 35 miles to ram his blue Toyota Prius at a marked police van on August 25, 2017. A court heard today he was sprayed with CS gas and arrested after he reached for the blade and scuffled with two officers. The two officers had to be rushed to hospital.  Counter-terrorist police recovered evidence of extremist internet searches and WhatsApp messages saying he supported Isis from his handset. The taxi driver told the Old Bailey: I felt lonely and depressed. I told my sister I didn\u0027t want to live anymore. My intention was only to show the sword to a soldier or the police and so get them to shoot me. If I was going to do any acts of terrorism, I could have got out the car with my sword when Mr Gavin was approaching. I had so many chances. I reject the allegations of terrorism.  Chowdhury, from Luton, Beds., said he had felt guilty being a citizen of the United Kingdom while Muslims in Yemen were being killed by weapons that the government sold to Saudi Arabia. He continued: I came across articles criticising the UK government for selling weapons to Saudi Arabia who were killing these people. Since I realised we were giving aid to them and at the same time providing the weapons for them to be killed, I thought this was a massive contradiction. I felt depressed and guilty. I felt I was also responsible for the decisions taken by my government while my family were dying.  I had to shun these people, and show my disapproval. At the time I did not know not to do it. There was nothing I could do. I just wanted to disassociate myself from my governments decision. But Timothy Cray, prosecuting, claimed Chowdhury had always intended to scare people in Westminster, less than six months after a horrific terrorist attack there killed five innocent citizens . Mr Cray said: Your intention at the very least was to make sure you would do as much as you could possibly do to get lethal force with the firing of a weapon in a public place, right in the centre of London. Think about it now, there were people there. Anybody seeing the discharging of lethal force on the street would be scared.

Hillary Harris, 31, was stunned to find the person sharing her driveway was the sibling she\u0027d never met, and the pair hit it off immediately. Describing how she felt when she realised, she said: “I began to shake. It was such an intense moment. Hillary knew her sibling was called Dawn Johnson and noticed that name on an item of post in her building. Stunned, she plucked up courage to speak to Dawn, 50, and they discovered that they had the same father, Wayne Clouse. Hillary and her biological brother Tyler Hardy, 33, were adopted in 1987 by Lee Hardy, 65, and his late wife Rochelle.  The childcare worker began the search for her biological family when she became pregnant with her daughter Stella, now seven, in 2011. Her adoption agency revealed the names of her birth parents but she was heartbroken to discover her father Wayne Clouse had died in 2002. When going through her file, Hillary discovered her late father’s obituary which mentioned his daughters Dawn Johnson and Renee Diericks, 49,  Hillary, of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, had searched for Wayne\u0027s daughters on Facebook but had been unsuccessful in tracking them down.  Then in June 2017, a woman named Dawn and her partner Kurt Casperson, 53, moved in next door. Hillary thought nothing of it at first, but in August she saw Dawn’s last name on a package being delivered.  She struck up the courage to ask her new neighbor who her father was via text and Dawn, a lab processor, confirmed her suspicions. Stunned Hillary said: “For me this is 100 per cent fate. I was so sad when I discovered my biological father had passed away. But by meeting Dawn I feel like I have all the answers I will ever need. She’s the missing puzzle piece I have been looking for for so many years. “For me something first clicked in June when I found out her name was Dawn and she was from Greenwood. My husband and I joked for a few weeks that she was my sister but we didn’t know her last name. “One day she got a delivery of shingles for her roof and it was addressed to Dawn Johnson, the same name in Wayne’s obituary. “I began to shake. It was such an intense moment.  “It was late at night, but I finally got the courage to text her and ask her who her dad was. She confirmed it was Wayne. I told her we had a lot to talk about and she said, \u0027We have the same dad don’t we?\u0027 Hillary said that since then they have grown very close. She said when she met her birth mum she thought she would have an immediate bond but she didn\u0027t. Yet with Dawn, there was a connection straight away. Dawn, who did not grow up with her father but formed a relationship with him later in life, added: “It’s such a weird coincidence. “Of all the hundreds of thousands of homes we bought a house that shares a driveway with my sister. “I was ecstatic and so was my sister Renee. She couldn’t believe it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl six lured away family","story":"NewsGirl, six, is raped, murdered and mutilated by stranger who \u0027lured her from wedding with promise of ice cream\u0027WARNING: DISTRESSING AND GRAPHIC CONTENT Chilling CCTV footage has been released showing the small child following a man into the street in India\u0026nbspShareByKelly-Ann Mills11:39, 22 JUN 2018Updated17:29, 22 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA six-year-old girl was raped, murdered and mutilated after being lured away from a family wedding with the promise of ice cream Haunting CCTV shows the small child, in a floor-length white dress, following a man into the street in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, in India, on Wednesday evening. She was last seen holding the man\u0027s hand disappearing into darkness at around 11.30pm. The man is later seen returning alone three hours later at around 2.30am. Police began a desperate hunt for the little girl after her parents realised she was missing and her body was found on a hillock 500 metre from the venue in the early hours of Thursday morning.  She had been raped then strangled. Police said a stone had been used to disfigure her face \u0027beyond recognition\u0027. A man, believed to be a member of the wedding catering team, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Dharmraj Meena, the Senior Superintendent of Police of Gwalior, said: “Our team reached the spot along with the forensic experts, after seeing the crime scene it is quite clear that the child had undergone a brutal sexual assault. The criminal had used a big stone to smash her face and kill her.  We have started an investigation and the culprit will be nabbed soon, right now we have zeroed in on one person who is a part of the catering team, we are questioning him for further leads.”  The victim had been sleeping with her family at the wedding venue and had got up to get water when she vanished, according to The Free Press Journal. She went to a water point there to quench her thirst. When she did not return, her family launched a search, but failed to find her,\u0027an official said. Police said she had been lured away with the promise of ice cream. A post mortem confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. The case is the latest in a string of horrific rapes and murders which have rocked India over the last few years. In 2012, Jyoti Singh, a young woman who dreamed of being a physiotherapist, was assaulted on a bus.  Her injuries were so severe she later died, sparking mass protests, outrage and a call for change in a society where women face huge discrimination and live in fear of sexual assault. Despite the outcry, there has been little change since Jyoti\u0027s death at the age of 23.

Natalie Fink and first boyfriend Yannick Gwarys, both 22, decided to start dating other people in 2016 - before meeting Michael Flamm, 22. The throuple share a bed most nights and say they are inspired by German artist Max Ernst, who lived in a polyamorous relationship. The men say they are heterosexual and never struggle with feelings of jealousy. Natalie said: “I’ve always known that I had to love and to live in my own way and not how society taught me to.  It was not as if I needed another partner but we were excited about sharing our life with a third party. I grew up in a big family and wanted to keep the feeling of community.” The next step of their relationship is to marry - and have children. “We want children - and it is important to me that both men will be accepted as fathers, independent of biological paternity,” said Natalie. Although we would want to know the biological father because of medical questions.  If it will be helpful for our life, two of us will definitely get married legally. The three of us will decide which couple would be the most economical. Above all, marriage is a spiritual promise. I do not need a lawyer for that. If we want to make a life commitment, nobody can stop us from doing it. Who knows, maybe we will invite our families to their first polyamorous wedding in their lifetime. Natalie and Yannick met at college and were friends for many years before they fell in love in 2014. They had another polyamorous relationship but the first run didn\u0027t really work out - because the \u0027candidate\u0027 recognised himself as monogamous in the end.

The well-preserved mummy, said to be that of an ancient woman, was still dressed in the silk skirt in her grave. She reportedly also had a pouch of pine nuts on her chest ready to take to the afterlife. A significant fall in the water level of a reservoir upstream of the giant 794ft tall Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectricity dam on the River Yenisei in south Russia led to the burial site of the woman - as old as Christ - reappearing on the shoreline.  “In her birch bark make-up box, she had a Chinese mirror,” reported The Siberian Times. “During excavations the mummy of a young woman was found on the shore of the reservoir. “The lower part of the body was especially well preserved, said archeologist Marina Kilunovskaya, from St Petersburg’s Institute of History of Material Culture. She continued: his is not a classic mummy - in this case, the burial was tightly closed with a stone lid, enabling a process of natural mummification.  Remarkably, the mummification partially survived her burial plot being drowned during the Soviet era in the early 1980s. Natalya Solovieva, the Institute of History of Material Culture\u0027s deputy director, said: On the mummy are what we believe to be silk clothes, a beaded belt with a jet buckle, apparently with a pattern… “Near the head was found a round wooden box covered with birch-bark in which lay a Chinese mirror in a felt case.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b28e912c204b-180x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc bob shankly was easily the best boss says ex dee man united and arsenal defender","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor a man who enjoyed a career at the top of the game playing for Arsenal, Manchester United and Scotland, it’s something for Ian Ure to say the best manager he ever worked with was at Dundee.Now 78, Ure joined the Dark Blues in 1958 as an 18-year-old but it wasn’t until Bob Shankly arrived the following year that he began to make an impact in the first team.Dundee had enjoyed a successful period in the early 50s, winning two League Cups, but that team had waned.Shankly came in, shook things up, and created the best team ever seen in dark blue.Within three years they won the league and were in the European Cup semi-final the following year.Ure said: “Bob Shankly was easily the best manager I ever worked with.“He just had the knack of getting the best out of players.“He was a strong character and could swear like a trooper but he could read people.“He was a real down-to-earth kind of guy and you believed in him when you played for him.“You had to work and he instilled that in the team. No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee bus firm to unveil new greener fleet with free wifi and usb charging","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee bus firm has unveiled a £4 million fleet of new vehicles that it hopes will be a breath of fresh air to locals.Xplore Dundee’s 14 low-emission “Emerald” buses, as the firm calls them, are double deckers built by Falkirk manufacturers Alexander Dennis Ltd.As well as packing modern tech such as free wifi, USB charging and “next stop” announcements, the buses come with low-pollutant hybrid engines that emit fewer greenhouse gases.The new vehicles were showcased at Discovery Point by Xplore’s new managing director Christine McGlasson to mark Clean Air Day.Ms McGlasson said the buses would be on the streets by the autumn.“We take our role in recognising and reducing our city’s air quality issues very seriously,” she said.“We are therefore actively embracing clean technology in our fleet because we want to run buses that are green inside and out. This is our message on Clean Air Day 2018 as we look to the future: buses are not part of the problem – they are the solution to pollution.”Dundee is one of several Scottish cities that will introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in the near future.LEZs will prevent older vehicles that do not meet strict emissions standards from entering certain parts of the city, in order to improve air quality and people’s health in the process.Health Secretary and Dundee East MSP Shona Robison and Dundee City Council’s city development convener Lynne Short were also at Discovery Point today.Ms Robison said: “This is a great boost to Dundee’s environmental credentials and will help to make our city greener.”Ms Short added: “Everyone benefits from better air quality but it is also everyone’s responsibility to think about their individual or corporate contribution and having a national Clean Air Day helps to do that in a very specific way.”Xplore plans to deploy most of its new vehicles on the service 22 route, which uses the city’s Seagate – one of Scotland’s pollution hotspots, according to air quality studies.It’s the latest step undertaken in Dundee to reduce vehicle emissions.The council already offers perks to electric vehicle owners, while European funding secured 12 hydrogen buses for city fleets in March.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people octogenarian to graduate at

grandmother said she would feel “incredibly proud” when she receives her diploma in higher education – an achievement that will rank among the most memorable in an exceptional life.It was her battle against endometrial cancer in 2014 that prompted her to return to education, determined to make the most of her “second chance”.She said: “There is no doubt that falling ill made me re-examine my life.“I had a wonderful surgeon at Ninewells who managed to remove my cancer and having that second chance made me think more about what I wanted to do with my life.“That’s when I started to think about studying at university.”Elisabeth soon found herself at the centre of student life and immersing herself in books in the university library.She served as a councillor in Angus from 1988-95, establishing herself as one of the foremost authorities on supporting people with drug and alcohol problems in the region, work for which she received an OBE in 2000.Before entering politics, she worked as a press officer at Glasgow’s Citizens Theatre in the 1960s.Keeping a very busy schedule, Elisabeth continues to work as the chairwoman of Angus Women’s Aid.She will be joined by her husband

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play I think is entertaining to watch.“We have a very good young base to build on and I think if we build on that base it will be very exciting next year.”The 2017/18 campaign ended with a degree of disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed with “just a few more pieces of the puzzle” needed to push Dundee to the top table in Scotland’s top flight.The American added: “Once again he can build on last season and with just a few more pieces of the puzzle we have quite a good picture going forward.“With what we’re doing with players at the moment and getting ready for pre-season, it seems like the season ended a week ago and all of a sudden we’re back.“This is the busiest time of the year for us, we are trying to get players in and do things to bolster the team and really get ready for the upcoming season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29ce2188d-453x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united boss csaba wont rush fyvie back early from serious injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo could wrap key midfielder Fraser Fyvie up in cotton wool for part of Dundee United’s pre-season build-up in a bid to make sure he’s fit for most of next season.Fyvie, who signed a new two-year contract recently, is still battling back from a serious knee injured that forced him to miss the second half of last season.And while the 25-year-old is keen to start full training when the new-look United squad report for work tomorrow after their summer break, Csaba may ease him back.He’s even prepared to see Fyvie miss the opening weeks of the season to make sure he’s 100% ready when he does return.“I hope, of course, he is ready soon but if by the end of September he is on the pitch I will be happy about it,” said Csaba.“He’s made a huge development. He is already OK and he wants to begin but I want him to take it a little bit easier because we want him for the long term, not two weeks.”Another of United’s long-term absentees from last term, James Keatings, will definitely be working with the rest of the squad right from the off tomorrow.The former Hearts and Hibs man has been out since early January because of a groin problem that required surgery.He’s been working over the summer, however, and is on course to be ready for the big kick-off next month.“Keatings is OK. Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7124197d4-839x564.jpg ","title":"hidden costs of school day for hard up dundee families is laid bare","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe hidden costs of the school day for Dundee families have been laid bare in a new report.Dundee City Council recruited the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) charity to carry out a study on what could be done to reduce financial pressures on hard-up families.School uniforms, travel costs and even the hiring of musical instruments, are all proving to be economic barriers for kids.The report is based on work with pupils, staff and family members in schools and nurseries across Dundee.Pupils took part in two sessions which involved a case study featuring characters from low-income households. Kids were then asked to identify school costs which might create a barrier to participating in school.Among the issues addressed were breakfast clubs, uniform, lunches and snacks, school trips, homework and attitudes to poverty.The report found that uniform is one of the most expensive outlays for families, particularly replacing worn and torn clothes — and if families cannot afford to replace them, it can leave pupils embarrassed.Some pupils are also coming into school unfed – and inconsistencies in breakfast clubs across the city means that there aren’t always spaces for children in need.The timing of events, such as at Halloween and Christmas, was also leaving a dent in parents’ pockets, or leaving children excluded because their mums and dads can’t afford, for example, a Halloween costume.The Child Poverty Action Group, which conducted a similar exercise in Glasgow: “There is still some way to go to ensure that all children and young people from low income households are able to access all of the same opportunities as their peers.”One Dundee mum who knows how expensive it can be to send children to school is Sara Hay, 36, from Linlathen.Sara has one child Brandon Davidson in P1 at Rowantree Primary School and her son Findlay will start after the summer. She said: “There’s no doubt sending your kids to school is expensive. By the time you buy uniforms, shoes, bags and even pay for dress-down days, it’s a lot of money.“You often feel guilty because you maybe can’t afford to buy your children what others have, but it comes down to making the right choice.“Rowantree Primary is very good. We have a support group that runs a swap-shop, which is a great help. I also get support from my family.”Children and families service convener Councillor Gregor Murray said the report is a “hard-hitting” piece of research that raises a number of questions.Councillor Murray added said: “We raised the school clothing grant in Dundee to £100 in recognition of the struggles that families were facing.“Significant assistance from the Scottish Government has allowed us to make progress in narrowing the poverty attainment gap.“This report about the cost of the school day gives us many issues to think over and solutions need to be carefully considered.”The report highlights a number of examples of good practice to alleviate the economic barriers facing pupils.One of these is Craigie High School, where new first-year pupils are all given a pencil case filled with stationery so every youngster starts on the same footing.John Dickie, director of CPAG in Scotland, said: “Many Dundee schools and staff working in them are clearly sensitive to the fact that lots of families are struggling financially, and there is fantastic work happening across the city to keep school costs low and to support families where needed.“But cost barriers still remain and are preventing too many children from getting the most out of their education.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b713ac0e65-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals demand action over eyesore at old dundee nursery and play area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “neglected” piece of land next to a disused building in Fintry has been branded an eyesore by angry residents.Grass, bushes and trees next to the former nursery school on Fintry Road have been left to grow for about a year, locals said today.The nursery closed nine years ago, and despite previous applications to convert the building, no plans have come to fruition.The council-owned land also houses play equipment.Elspeth Muir, 66, a domestic worker with NHS Tayside, has lived at Fintry Mills, overlooking the site, for more than 30 years. She said: “It’s a mess. Since the nursery closed it hasn’t really been maintained.“There were ideas for things to use the building but nothing ever happened and it’s just got worse since then.“Even if they just cut the grass it would make it a bit better to look at. The playpark was used occasionally but not any more.”Retired couple Katherine and Brian Perrie, who also live at Fintry Mills, said the extent of the overgrown land meant they no longer opened the windows at the back of their Abertay Housing Association property.They said the land was initially maintained when they moved in six years ago but it had become particularly overgrown in the past two years.Katherine, 67, added: “It’s been like that for a while.“As far as I can remember, the council has cut the grass once in about two years. It’s just a mess. We can’t open our windows now because you get all the insects and pollen from it.“It’s a disgrace to look out on to, just an eyesore. It was a nice view before, when it was maintained.”Brian, 70, said: “It used to be cut regularly but they’ve stopped for some reason.“It’s daft because the council cuts the grass at the front of the houses every fortnight, so it has the equipment and staff. It must just be budget cuts like everything else.“The last time it was cut was after I raised the issue with Abertay Housing Association, who reported it to the council.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “We will arrange for the grass to be cut as soon as possible.”The building served as a nursery for 50 years until it closed in 2009, and has remained empty since.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man admits exposing himself in dundee multi","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 52-year-old man admitted that he committed a sexual act in a public area at Elders Court on December 7 last year, while on bail.Allan May, of Elders Court, also admitted that on October 29, at the same multi-storey building, he walked about in the main communal entrance while having the lower half of his body completely exposed, also while on bail.Sentence was deferred until July 17 and May was granted bail.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/57cfe1c2dde84-409x400.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group hs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first round of World Cup fixtures is almost over with Group H set to get under way today.Colombia might be the dark horses for the tournament and Poland boast one of the world\u0026#8217s top sharpshooters in Robert Lewandowski, Senegal have Liverpool\u0026#8217s Sadio Mane while Japan might have a former United keeper between the sticks.The Tele looks at the final set of countries and how they \u0026#8211 some tenuously \u0026#8211 are linked to both city clubs.GROUP HColombiaAnother nation with a golden generation, much is expected of this Colombia side back home.Four years ago, led by talisman James Rodriguez, they entertained their way to the quarter-final where they lost out to hosts Brazil in controversial fashion.This time around they find themselves in a group of unfancied teams which could give them the platform for another run into the knockout stages.With players like James, Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Tottenham’s Davinson Sanchez, they possess quality throughout the squad.Star player: James Rodriguez.Local link: Colombia were invited to take on Scotland and England in the 1988 Rous Cup and arrived in the UK with stars like Carlos Valderrama, Rene Higuita and the tragic Andres Escobar, who was later murdered after scoring an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.A Dundee United player at the time, Kevin Gallacher played the full 90 minutes at Hampden as the teams played out a 0-0 draw and Scotland finished third out of three.JapanA mainstay of recent World Cups, Japan are looking to repeat their appearances in the knockout rounds in 2002 and 2010 after failing to win a game in 2014.With the experienced Keisuke Honda helped by former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa, Japan have the guile to open teams up for Leicester’s Shinji Okazaki to finish.Star player: Shinji Kagawa.Local link: Dundee United fans won’t have fond memories of him – Dundee fans might – but goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima goes into this World Cup with the No 1 jersey.Signed by Mixu Paatelainen at Tannadice, Kawashima signed to regain his place in the national side but failed to perform as the club suffered relegation.The 35-year-old now plays for French top-flight club Metz.PolandThe Poles sailed to qualification for this one through a tough group that included Denmark, Montenegro and Romania thanks to a record goals haul of 16 by Robert Lewandowski.When they do qualify for World Cups, Poland tend to do well with two third-place finishes to their name.Those came in 1974 and 1982 but they’ve not made it out of the group stage since 1986.With one of the most lethal finishers in the tournament, they could surprise a few.Star player: Robert Lewandowski.Local link: Impressive goalkeepers have been the main export to the city from Poland for United but two outfielders come to mind at Dens.Dariusz Adamczuk and Pietor Czachowski arrived at Dundee in 1993 but couldn’t prevent relegation – Adamczuk would be fondly remembered in his second spell, returning in 1996 before departing for Rangers in 1999.

providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Symptom onset is usually between ages three and five and the disease primarily affects boys, although in rare cases it can affect girls.Sonia, who completed this year\u0027 Loch Ness Etape as part of her training, said: \"Every week, two families in the UK are given the devastating news that their son has DMD, and we believe there are at least two cases in the north.\"The Paris dash is to raise money for research and raise awareness.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds.

An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Borders Book Festival organisers say events going ahead  as normal ","story":"ORGANISERS of the Borders Book Festival have said\u0026nbspall events

that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war.

Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"Open-top tourist bus tours of East Lothian to start this summer","story":"              A NEW bus service that will serve East Lothian\u0027s tourist attractions will be launched at the end of the month.

Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7960619.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Crying girl on Time cover    not separated from mother   ","story":"              A girl pictured on the cover of Time magazine was not separated from her mother despite the poignant image of the child standing alone weeping, US Border Patrol officials said.  Time attached a correction to the story, saying: \u0026ldquoThe original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she (was) taken from the scene.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was not carried away screaming by US Border Patrol agents her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together.  The Time caption says the photo was taken when the girl and her mother were apprehended by Border Patrol officers on June 12 and the mother was being searched \u0026ldquobefore being sent to a processing center for possible separation.  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on Friday that the mother, Sandra Sanchez, is being housed at one of the government\u0026rsquos three existing family detention facilities at the South Texas Family Residential Centre in Dilley, Texas, 230 miles north of McAllen.  ICE would not provide information on the girl citing privacy reasons of juveniles.  Sanchez, 32, was arrested by Border Patrol agents while travelling with the little girl under the zero tolerance policy that criminally charges anyone caught crossing the border illegally.  She was transferred to ICE custody on June 17, and is being housed at the South Texas Family Residential Centre in Dilley, according to a statement from ICE. Her immigration case is ongoing.  The agency said that she had been previously deported to Honduras in 2013, and she had illegally re-entered. ICE did not comment on the girl, citing privacy reasons.  It is not clear what will happen to her daughter, who is almost two years old, but immigration officials have said the goal would be to keep the family together even if they are deported.  In Honduras, the girl\u0026rsquos father, Denis Varela, said he had not heard from his wife or daughter in almost three weeks, and Ms Sanchez took their daughter to the United States without telling him.  He says the Honduran foreign ministry also told him that his daughter is detained with her mother and the two have not been separated.  Mr Varela, a dock worker who lives in Puerto Cortes, Honduras, said that the ministry gave him the girl\u0026rsquos detainee identification number a couple of days ago.  The executive order signed this week by President Donald Trump stopped the separation of children from parents at the border, instead saying they should be detained together as their cases progress.  There have been signs at the border that the zero tolerance policy was slowing, but Justice Department and Homeland Security officials say the policy has not been reversed.  A 1997 landmark settlement known as the Flores agreement, which generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days, remains in place.  Mr Trump is seeking to have the settlement overturned but the Department of Justice said on Wednesday that the 20-day policy essentially stays in effect until Congress or the courts take action to change that."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7800993.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arm\u0027s-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements. We expect to give an update on this over the coming weeks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP government budget underspend almost   500m","story":"              THE Scottish Government underspend was almost half a billion pounds last year, prompting claims of mismanagement and ministers sitting on an unused \u0026ldquoslush fund.  The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.

Derek Mackay must apologise to communities across Scotland that have been damaged by his reckless actions.  Tory Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoDerek Mackay might like to fool us all into thinking this \u0026pound453m underspend figure is an insignificant sum.

The UK Environment Secretary said proposals for a five-year transition period in which farming subsidies would continue after Brexit were \u0026ldquotaking a leaf out of his department\u0026rsquos book.  It comes as Scottish Secretary David Mundell accused the SNP of mining \u0026ldquofake grievance\", despite engaging positively with UK ministers behind the scenes.  Earlier this week, the SNP outlined post-Brexit plans for Scottish farmers that would see subsidies kept in place and Brussels red tape slashed over a five-year transition period.  It said the proposals went further than the UK Government, which has said all subsidies provided by the EU will continue until the end of the current parliamentary term in 2022.  But visiting the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said: \"I think they\u0027re taking a leaf out of our book.  \"They understand that life outside the European Union means you can remove some bureaucracy from the lives of farmers, and that has to be a good thing.\"  He insisted the UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the future of farming had been very well received, adding: \" I think [that] suggests the path that we want to take agriculture south of the border is one that\u0027s got universal support.  \"Here in Scotland we respect the fact there is a devolved administration that will make its own decisions, but it\u0027s encouraging that the direction of travel the Scottish Government wants to take is one that\u0027s following in our footsteps.\"  Mr Gove also pledged that Scottish farmers would always receive \u0026ldquospecial treatment because they face unique challenges.  He was questioned about a long-anticipated review into the distribution of EU farm subsidies between Scotland and the rest of the UK, amid claims Scottish hill farmers are owed \u0026pound160m from the Treasury.  He said: \"We\u0027re going to make sure that Scotland receives the support that it needs in the future.  \"And we\u0027re going to make sure that the unique circumstances of Scotland\u0027s geography and Scotland\u0027s farming sector are reflected in the allocations that we make in the future.\"  Mr Gove said he hoped an Agriculture Bill detailing the UK Government\u0027s plans for farming post-Brexit would be published at the end of July.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the message from the SNP at Westminster was \u0026ldquolets weaponise Brexit as an opportunity to take forward independence.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe complete and utter myth that agricultural powers were going to be seized by the UK government has at least this week been shot down completely."},{"url":null,"title":"Treasury is not the   39 enemy of Brexit   39  insists Hammond","story":"              THE Treasury is not the \"enemy of Brexit\" but will be Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquochampion of prosperity outwith the European Union, Philip Hammond has insisted.  The Chancellor used his annual Mansion House speech to City figures in London to confront attacks from Brexiteer critics, who have condemned the financial department on his watch.  In front of an audience including Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Mr Hammond said the Treasury would be the \"champion of prosperity for the British people\" after Brexit but it would be \"working and trading closely\" with the EU.  His words followed a secret recording of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, who was heard describing the financial heart of the UK Government as \"basically the heart of Remain\".  As well as recognising Britain\u0027s EU membership since 1973 and the importance of trade, the Chancellor said the post-Brexit landscape should reflect the scale of goods travelling between Dover and Calais, continental defence and security co-operation and \"centuries of shared history and culture\".  He explained: \"So as we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decades...that maintains low friction borders and open markets.  \"That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027 rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU but working and trading closely with it.  \"And part of that successful future partnership must be a mechanism that enables UK EU financial services trade to continue delivering the benefits of open markets and deep regulatory co-operation.  \"Of course, we recognise that this will be a new kind of relationship, reflecting a new, and fair, balance of rights and responsibilities.\"  At the start of June, Theresa May said she had full confidence in Mr Johnson after he told a private dinner there was a risk Brexit \"will not be the one we want\" and would keep the UK \"locked in orbit\" around the EU.  At the gathering of the Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite campaign group, he claimed negotiations were approaching a \"moment of truth\" and warned of a Brexit \"meltdown\".  That followed criticism from Priti Patel, the former International Trade Secretary, who accused the Chancellor and the Prime Minister of \"negativity\" and urged a \"better vision for the future\" after Brexit.  Mr Carney used his own speech on Thursday night to say he believed an \"ambitious\" financial services relationship with the EU - founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation - remained \"feasible\".  Echoing the Government\u0027s mantra of a post-Brexit \"global\" Britain, he said: \"Having put in place the pillars of responsible, open financial system, we are ready for deeper global financial partnerships with the emerging economies that will be the most important drivers of global growth in the decades ahead.\"  To this end, the Bank would deepen its supervisory co-operation with major emerging economies and develop infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows, he explained.  Mr Carney said it also wanted to help enable UK households and businesses to transact \"anywhere, anytime with anyone whether around the corner or around the world\".  The Canadian used the speech to say that financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  Responding the Chancellor\u0027s \u0026pound1.2 billion capital injection onto the Bank\u0027s balance sheet, alongside reforms to its framework, the Governor said: \"We now have a balance sheet fit for purpose. One that reflects the Bank\u0027s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential policy and resolution. And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability.\"  The Chancellor also used his speech to announce the creation of a Green Finance Institute based in the capital, jointly funded by government and the City of London.  He also said a Financial Services Skills Taskforce would be set up by TheCityUK, led by former City Minister Mark Hoban, to \"meet the long-term skills needs of the sector over the coming decades and creating opportunities for the next generation\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Salmond does not pull SNP  39 s Westminster strings  Blackford insists","story":"              ALEX Salmond is not pulling the SNP\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, Ian Blackford has insisted, as he made clear he has no regrets over his bitter personal attack against David Mundell over Brexit.  Earlier this week, the Nationalist leader in the Commons intensified the political rhetoric when he denounced the Scottish Secretary as \u0026ldquoyellow for not speaking in a debate and a \u0026ldquodismal failure in his role at the Scotland Office.  He accused Mr Mundell of \u0026ldquostabbing Scotland in the back over the devolved powers controversy, declaring: \u0026ldquoHe fails to stand up for Scotland as a country, fails to stand up for our Parliament, he sees us as subservient. That\u0027s why the Secretary of State needs to go. He is quite simply unfit for the office he holds.\"  Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos remarks came just days after he was ordered from the Commons by the Speaker and led a mass walkout of SNP MPs from the chamber.  Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.  But when the Highland MP was asked if Mr Salmond was pulling the party leadership\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, he responded with a firm \u0026ldquoNo.  Mr Blackford also insisted his angry remarks directed at Mundell were not meant to be personal.  \u0026ldquoI was robust in how I spoke because the Secretary of State has failed to defend Scotland at every turn, he has been a complete failure, he declared.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot wish to be personal about the Secretary of State but on the lack of ability in serving Scotland\u0026rsquos interest, as defined by the Government itself, it is not good enough.  The party leader made clear he had not accused individual MPs of being \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish but, rather, Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government.  A Whitehall insider suggested the SNP leadership was losing the argument on the Brexit Bill, which was why it was resorting to \u0026ldquocheap personal attacks.  Meanwhile, as Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Michael Russell, her Brexit Minister, headed for Guernsey to attend the British-Irish Council, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will also be at the meeting, stressed how, despite the strong disagreements with Edinburgh over the Brexit Bill, the UK Government was committed to improving the depth of its co-operation with the SNP administration.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the inevitable political noise as we unpick the complexities of our membership of the EU, I will ensure that we maintain the depth of our ongoing engagement with the Scottish Government, including this week at the British-Irish Council in Guernsey. I hope that the Scottish Government will maintain their own side of that relationship.  He added: \u0026ldquoBy working together, we will help secure a deal that sees us leave the European Union as a more modern country where all four nations have their voices heard but also as one United Kingdom as the people of Scotland voted for in 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"Younger generation has little chance of becoming wealthy  report claims","story":"              Young people today have less chance of becoming truly wealthy than any previous post-war generations, according to a new report.  Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Poll  UK wants second EU referendum","story":"              ALMOST half of voters want a second referendum on Brexit, according to a new poll released on the eve of the second anniversary of the historic vote to leave the EU.  And the survey for ITV1\u0027s Good Morning Britain suggested that a fresh poll would produce a very different outcome, with the UK voting to remain in the EU by a margin of 53% to 47%.  The projected result effectively reverses the referendum of June 23 2016, when Leave took 53% of votes, compared to 48% support for Leave.  Pollsters Survation found that 48% of those questioned wanted a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, against just 25% who did not. Some 18% said they did not have an opinion and 9% did not know.  Those supporting a new referendum included 35% of Leave voters and 66% of those who back Remain.  The survey found that 43% of voters back a \"soft Brexit\" - in which the UK would stay in both the single market and customs union - while 37% favour a \"hard Brexit\" in which Britain would leave both.  Some 57% of 2017 Labour voters backed a soft Brexit, against 23% who prefer a hard version.  Almost half (47%) of more than 1,000 people questioned thought leaving the EU without a deal would be bad for Britain, compared to 32% who said it would be good for Britain.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: \"This new polling shows just how much momentum is building behind the campaign for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal.  \"This Saturday will see tens of thousands from all over the UK marching for a People\u0027s Vote in London and support is growing across the country.  \"With the negotiations in chaos, with the Government making a total mess of Brexit and with Parliament paralysed, now is the time for people to take back control of the process.\"  Eloise Todd of the Best for Britain campaign said: \"MPs from all parties risk being two years out of date.

Just 17% of those taking part could identify the correct definition of the customs union, while 38% chose the correct description of the single market.  Nearly two-fifths (39%) said they had a \u0027limited\u0027 understanding of the issues around the Irish border, while a further fifth (19%) said that they didn\u0027t know anything about or hadn\u0027t heard of the issue.  Some 40% thought Brexit would make the relationship between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland more distant, compared to 30% who thought it would make no difference and 10% that it would make the relationship closer.  Meanwhile, 42% thought Brexit would make the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and the UK as a whole more distant, against just 8% who said it would benefit the relationship and 32% that it would be unchanged."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4256672.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Edinburgh Trams profits soar","story":"              EDINBURGH Trams racked up five times the expected profits last year.

He added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances\" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.  MPs approved parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill related to devolution after less than 20 minutes of debate last week, despite the Scottish Parliament voting against granting formal consent for the Bill.

The struggling department store chain will close 31 out of its 59 outlets through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which will also allow it to secure rent reductions on its remaining shops.  Closures will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords, for the CVA at a meeting on Friday.  It was voted through despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to stomach a financial hit at the same time as House of Fraser enjoys new investment.  Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake in the firm and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  At the meeting, furious landlords berated House of Fraser\u0027s management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted.  They complained that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal.  Despite their protestations, a representative for two of House of Fraser\u0027s landlords said there had been \"no give\" from the top team.  House of Fraser boss Alex Williamson had warned that the store closures and job losses represented the \"last viable\" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected.  Mr Williamson and chairman Frank Slevin were both in attendance at the creditor vote.  House of Fraser said the shops earmarked for closure, including its Oxford Street store, would remain open until early 2019.  The group also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \"secure House of Fraser\u0027s future\".  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.

The group, which worked closely with the FA and the Foreign Office to prepare travel advice for fans, also cited the long distances, high costs and unlikely holiday feel to many host cities as factors for low numbers.  Many England fans have spent thousands travelling to watch the Three Lions, taking multiple indirect planes or train journeys that last up to 24 hours.  In a blog post, the FSF said there was a \"great\" disparity between the image portrayed in the media and the welcome fans had received in Volgograd.  \"The only sad thing about the whole experience is that the numbers of England fans who have been here to enjoy it have been so low: we reckon it\u0027s been probably the lowest number of England fans at a World Cup game for 30 years,\" the FSF said.  \"We know there are a lot of other reasons why a lot of people have chosen to support the team from back home - there\u0027s the distances, the cost of travel, the inescapable fact that Russia isn\u0027t really a traditional family holiday destination - but it\u0027s nonetheless a shame that some fans have been deterred from coming here because of disproportionate hype about the hooligan threat or political tensions.  \"The big majority of Russian people have been immensely friendly, generous and welcoming.  \"England fans above all should know from bitter experience the price that can be paid for judging everybody on the behaviour of a minority.\"  The FSF added that reports of hiked food and accommodation prices and an overbearing police and security presence had been \"unfounded\", with security forces \"visible but unobtrusive\".  And fans\u0027 presence in Nizhny Novgorod was reportedly low two days before the Three Lions play Panama on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie menswear firm toasts 100k whisky contract","story":"\t\tPernod Ricard, owners of several prestigious spirit brands, has awarded a \u0026#163100k retail contract to menswear outfitters Gibbs Inverurie.\t\t\t\tA contingent of 875 Chinese are heading across the globe for a 4-day whisky extravaganza in July.

Now, however, the cost of electricity to power festive lighting will continue to be covered by the local authority after a new approach was agreed by councillors.                                                    Members of the Infrastructure Services Committee (ISC) gave the go ahead to a new policy aimed at ensuring a reasonable, consistent and safe approach to requests from community groups.        Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.                                                                                                        An engagement meeting was held with groups in April where a number of concerns were raised and consideration of these led to changes to the proposed policy. Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Friday 22 Jun 2018 10:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Temporary reprieve for public toilets welcomed","story":"CLOSURE-threatened public toilets in Caithness and other parts of the Highlands have won a temporary reprieve.Highland Council has decided to put its plan on hold until a review of toilet provision in its area is carried out \u0026ndash but it will not be completed until October.In the meantime, the toilets threatened with closure will remain open.The local authority proposed closing 28 of the 96 public toilets in the Highlands while charging 50p for those that stay open. The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

The closing date for responses will be Friday July 27 2018.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike. Everyone involved in these results is to be congratulated.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
