These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers in recent days, only to be told their policies don’t cover the pandemic.Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told insurers to halt idend payments to allow them to pay claims. It had already told insurers it expects them to treat customers fairly.A group of brokers and loss adjusters havejoined forces and will ask a barrister to examine the policies, with a view to taking legal action.The Hiscox Action Group said the firm’s policies clearly state they will pay up where the interruption to the business was “due to restrictions imposed by a public authority following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease”.Other insurers, including Eaton Gate, have similar terms and expected to face similar legal action in the coming months, the group said.Alan Dexter, who runs four restaurants in Glasgow, including Barsa Tapas, said two of his premises have business interruption cover provided by Hiscox but his claims were last week denied. He has been forced to put his 140 staff on furlough because of the crisis.Dexter said: “Our broker pointed out that the cover states we can claim in the event of a notifiable disease, and, to my untrained eye, the policy appears to cover the exact circumstance I and many other business owners find themselves in. But after taking several days, Hiscox last week came back and said it would not be paying our claim. The company markets itself in its publicity material as the insurer that always pays out, but that has not been my experience.”Roger Topping, who runs TopMark Adjusters, a Glasgow-based firm of loss adjusters and one of those behind the legal challenge, has called on the insurers to pay or for the government to step in.Topping said: “We have heard ministers tell insurers to pay these claims but, to my knowledge, not a single insurer has broken ranks and paid a claim. This is not just a Hiscox issue, several other companies including Eaton Gate, an insurer backed by Royal Sun Alliance, are in a similar position. It seems that the massive losses involved have caused the insurance industry to start searching for reasons not to pay.”He called for the government and insurers to find a solution before “a multitude of legal actions against insurers begin, and massive sums of money are wasted on legal fees. We need something along the lines adopted previously for claims following riots, flooding, or what we saw in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.”Hiscox said: “We understand that these are incredibly difficult times for businesses affected by Covid-19. At Hiscox we strive to pay claims that are covered by the policies fairly and quickly.“However, general business interruption policies across the industry, including Hiscox’s, were not designed to cover these extraordinary circumstances. Like terrorism and flood, which have government-backed insurance schemes, pandemics like coronavirus are simply too large and too systemic for private insurers to cover,” it added.Last month, the Association of British Insurers told parliament’s business committee that few companies would be protected for their losses by their insurance policies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae40c2beaeeb6a2c94d0eae61d34d25955964540/0_202_3553_2131/master/3553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077708223f3d34e6399e9d8d4422f18e","title":"book gertrude stein autobiography alice b toklas","story":"The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas investigates the art and artifice of the genre – and transformed how I thought about itAs lockdown continues,  Opinion is reviving its A book that changed me series, an opportunity for writers to select the very best reading to help get us through these uncertain times, with a new instalment every Monday.I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when Gertrude Stein, the high priestess of early 20th-century modernist art and writer of baffling radical novels, came up with an audacious idea to make some money.The plan was that she would write about her own life in the guise of writing the autobiography of her partner, Alice B Toklas. If Alice were to narrate the book, it meant that she, Gertrude, could use her beloved as an avatar to speak about her own (often mocked) writing and offer a personal view of her friendship with some of the famous artists and writers she had met in Paris between 1903 and 1932.It was not lost on Stein that her relationship with Picasso, who was 24 when she met him, and Matisse, who was 35 (never mind Ernest Hemingway and F Scott Fitzgerald), would be of interest to a wide American audience when the book was published in 1933. This proved to be true and to her shame and delight, The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas – her most conventional book – became her most commercial.This would not be so interesting if Stein herself were not so interesting. It is sometimes forgotten that she trained in medicine rather than literature, beginning her student years in 1893 at Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard University) tightly laced into a corset. She became “irrevocably bored” with her medical studies and 10 years later, escaped to Paris, flung that corset off, began to collect the art that would light up the 20th century and found herself a wife.Any young writer keen to find female literary role models whose lives do not end with suicide would be encouraged by how Stein was unfashionably good at life and happy in love. Her four-year training in psychology with William James, her fascination with visual composition (Cézanne was a major early influence) and her literary interest in the techniques of cubism are evident in all her writing. Yet, oddly, it was when she wrote in the faux voice of Alice B Toklas, that I really began to want to reread her work.It was as if this literary strategy, or trick, somehow freed her own voice, and in so doing, gave me access to her beautiful mind and the impeccable cadence of her sentences. Her fluent, conversational and slightly strange prose is a rollicking read. When I began writing my own “living autobiographies” (Things I Don’t Want to Know, The Cost of Living), so called because they are written in the present tense of life and not in wise retrospect at the end of life, I took note of why I enjoyed spending time with Stein’s voice in this particular book.For a start, her thoughts on anything at all still feel new and uniquely her own. She recalls how the public were so infuriated by Matisse’s painting of his wife La Femme au chapeau when it was first exhibited in Paris, they tried to scratch off the paint. As Stein tells us through Alice: “It was very strange in its color and in its anatomy.” Stein bought it with her brother and became friends with Matisse, who at the time was impoverished.“Matisse had an astonishing virility that always gave one an extraordinary pleasure when one had not seen him for some time. Less the first time of seeing him than later. And one did not lose the pleasure of this virility all the time he was with one. But there was not much feeling of life in this virility. Madame Matisse was very different, there was a very profound feeling of life in her for anyone who knew her.”Stein can conjure the stranger qualities of presence like no one else.In discussing the drawings that Matisse was making to prepare for a larger work, Stein has Toklas offer a critique from the point of view of a cook – she would after all go on to write a famous recipe book.“He used his distorted drawing as a dissonance is used in music or as vinegar or lemons are used in cooking or egg shells in coffee to clarify. I do inevitably take my comparisons from the kitchen because I like food and cooking and know something about it.”Stein wisely reveals her hand in the closing lines of The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas: “About six weeks ago Gertrude Stein said, it does not look to me as if you were ever going to write that autobiography. You know what I am going to do. I am going to write it for you. I am going to write it as simply as Defoe did the autobiography of Robinson Crusoe. And she has and this is it.”Gertrude Stein changed the way I thought about writing autobiography because she so magnificently investigates the art and artifice of the genre.• Deborah Levy’s most recent novel, The Man Who Saw Everything, is published by Penguin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39e9e72f9e11dc72ca5fd4e1997c733ac107bce6/0_233_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25f7d0b06c49b660993c0e186bfbd25","title":"universities brace for huge losses as foreign students drop out","story":"Call for a government bailout worth billions to help sector survive the crisisSome universities are already expecting to lose more than £100m as foreign students cancel their studies, with warnings that the impact of coronavirus will be “like a tsunami hitting the sector”.Universities are already lining up online courses for the start of the next year, but academics are concerned about the impact on first-year students new to university life. Many institutions have recently borrowed heavily to pay for attractive new faculties, often designed to attract overseas students. It comes against a backdrop of declining numbers of university-age students in the UK and the previous uncertainty around Brexit.Andrew Connors, head of higher education at Lloyds Banking Group, said the crisis has felt “less like a perfect storm and more like a tsunami hitting the sector”. Banks have not had urgent requests from universities, as big financial hits are expected later in the year. However, he said that “while the immediate impact we are seeing in the sector is slower, the overall impact of Covid-19 is potentially deeper and longer”.He adds that he expects banks to offer UK universities loans where needed, given their significance in the economy. He warns, however: “I worked through the financial crisis of 200708 and it does not compare in my experience to what we are witnessing now – this crisis has touched everybody in some shape or form and many previously viable businesses are now in a fight for survival.”The Office for Students, the independent regulator of higher education, has already streamlined its rules in the wake of the crisis, calling for universities to sound the alarm if they fear they’ll run short of cash within 30 days.Universities UK, the industry body, has proposed a series of measures to the government to double research funding and offer emergency loans to troubled institutions, as well as placing a cap on the number of undergraduates many institutions can recruit in 2020-21.Nick Hillman, Hepi’s director, warned that universities only had limited options to cut their costs. “There are things they can do to mitigate the impact, such as doing all they can to ensure international students keep coming, pausing the development of their estates, doing less research, looking at their staffing and persuading home final-year students to stay on for postgraduate study. But some were in financial difficulties even before the current crisis.“If international student numbers are down a lot, we have a big problem. The ones with lots of international students could still potentially fill their places with home students (who pay lower fees) but that just leaves a problem lower down the tree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c9ac020f34099ae3db368e73ea0284cf5e683be/0_0_516_685/master/516.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=20735d353613e70c13abc9a98b355ac5 2020w","title":"my favourite film aged 12 you only live twice","story":"The fifth Bond had enough ninjas, piranhas and flamethrowers to blow one boy viewer’s head off – but its casual racism and sexism don’t look so smart post-Austin Powers Now it’s a Wetherspoon, but back in the day it was a temple to the seventh art. They called it Sedgley Clifton. Why? I don’t know, but I like to think they named it after Clifton Webb. It was there, in the heart of the Black Country in 1967, that my dad took me deeper into the black.There were aspidistras in the circle bar. The cinema’s red velour seats smelled of smoke and other ancient emissions. “Please don’t make infantile slurping noises,” said the announcement as I sucked on my Kia-Ora straw-cup. The floor was sticky. Then the lights went down for the last time. Perhaps my dad passed me some Maltesers. It was my first time. Hello darkness, my new friend.I was five and my dad 36 when we went to see You Only Live Twice. In memory, the action took place entirely in a submarine lair painted gunmetal grey. Everything was grey – Bond’s suits, the spacecraft, the polystyrene walls. I was being prepared for the grey adult world. The grey palette spread from the screen across walls and floor towards us, like blood rushing across the hotel corridor in The Shining. I’d never before felt so enveloped by a visual world, nor been asked to sit still for quite so long. The Pye television in the living room wasn’t big, and The Magic Roundabout only lasted 10 minutes.On screen, men were doing manly things – brawling, carrying clipboards, plotting the end of the world, talking about the correct way to serve vodka cocktails, whatever those were. I honoured these patriarchal mysteries in the same way I brought tea to my dad as he worked under the car’s bonnet before rushing indoors to get warm.The men were, I realise now, striving to foil a plot by an off-the-peg sociopath to hold both the USSR and the USA to ransom. Sure, there were women, three paces behind the action, in bikinis and unsuitable footwear. They clearly didn’t matter when the tough got going. The baddie, Donald Pleasence’s Blofeld, with his strange melted face, was notionally a man, but he stroked a white cat which meant a) he hadn’t got the memo about the colour scheme and b) was insufficiently butch, ultimately, to triumph over the good guys all of whom, Bond included, were making their assault on his lair in grey turtlenecks with matching hoods. Unlike the balaclava I wore to school, these hoods probably weren’t knitted by the ninjas’ mothers.In one repeated scene, a spaceship’s nose cone opened to consume a smaller spaceship, typifying how Blofeld could consume even the most advanced weapons with which the superpowers fought the cold war through proxies in space. At the time, I knew nothing of special effects budgets, but even I knew that Val Singleton on Blue Peter could have shown viewers how to recreate this scene with toilet roll tubes and metallic spray paint.Clearly, I understood next to nothing of the substance of the film then, but it made a powerful multimedia impression on me at a pre-verbal level. Not just the cinematography but the music – the sexy guitar gunfire of the theme tune, the sweeping strings and French horn harmonies ingeniously distracted from the manifold fatuities of the title song’s lyrics poor old Nancy Sinatra was obliged to sing.More importantly, seeing a Bond film so young gave me cultural cachet enough to strut the playground like Sean Connery in short trousers. Just as he could tell his Japanese hosts the correct temperature to serve sake (98.4F), so for a few months at Alder Coppice Infants I had peers hanging on my grasp of Bond minutiae – weaponry, clobber, balletic fisticuffs. Everything except the sex stuff, which was then beyond me. Watching the film 53 years later, its lethal cocktail of racism and misogyny leaves me shaken and stirred. Lewis Gilbert’s film was released a year before Wolverhampton MP Enoch Powell’s Rivers of Blood speech at Birmingham town hall. At Alder Coppice, boys and girls would march round that playground chanting: “Enoch, Enoch, Enoch Powell.” We didn’t know what or why we were chanting, but in retrospect the message was clear: the Black Country should be white and the rest of Britain, too.This makes the film’s perspective on race bracing, to put it mildly. At the outset, Bond peels himself off his latest dalliance in a Hong Kong bedroom and asks her: “Why do Chinese girls taste so different from the others?” His love interest (Ling) replies: “You think we better, huh?” Bond: “No, just different. Like Peking duck is different from Russian caviar. But I love them both.” Ling: “Darling, I give you very best duck.” The world, when you think about it in Bond’s eyes, is a buffet of women. And other races, too, are merely exotically consumable commodities. The double entendres passed me by aged five even now, they scarcely make a lick of sense. Incredibly, Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay and, let’s just say, sexist bants were not his forte. In another scene, for instance, Bond is the guest of the head of Japanese secret services and invited to join the latter in some strange domestic approximation of a Center Parcs water feature. “Now you take your first civilised bath,” says his genial host. “Really?” says Connery’s 007, leering at the scantily clad women bathing assistants who press their attentions on him, before adding gamely: “Well, I like the plumbing.” Nope, I haven’t a clue what he’s on about, either.Later, Bond must pass himself off as Japanese to become a ninja. Expert surgeons (more Japanese women in bras and knickers, possibly ironically foreshadowing hospital shortages in gowns, masks and globes during the Covid-19 crisis) operate. They shave his chest, brush his hair forward and install plastic prostheses around his eyes to make the former Edinburgh milkman look sufficiently oriental. What the fudge sundae? It’s a variation on the blackface I got used to while watching The Black and White Minstrel Show.Near the end, Bond and his fourth Asian dalliance of the movie have climbed a volcano to investigate Blofeld’s lair. She’s called Kissy, making her sister in British orientalising ridicule to The Mikado’s Pitti-Sing, Peep-Bo and Yum-Yum. While Bond wears stout shoes for the ascent, Kissy climbs in a bikini and the kind of fast-fashion flats that wouldn’t last five minutes on the pavements of the Shinjuku, much less ascending volcanic rubble. When the pair realise they’re outnumbered by Blofeld’s goons, Bond tells Kissy peremptorily to head back to get assistance. And so she does, descending the mountain in those shoes, swimming back to the mainland while strafed by helicopter gunfire and then returning with the aforementioned turtleneck-wearing ninjas. Say what you like about Bond women, but my God they uncomplainingly served the patriarchy.If there’s anything to take from this film to get us through lockdown, it’s Bond’s sang-froid in the face of apocalypse. He met whatever Johnny Foreigner could throw at him with stiff upper lip and stiffer crease in his trousers, buoyed no doubt by the prospect of a multicultural legover during the final credits. In the epilogue, mutually assured destruction averted, he puts the moves on Kissy in their inflatable raft, though you’d have thought both of them, and her in particular, wouldn’t have been too puffed for nautical how’s your father.I’m still trying to remember what the film was like before the veil descended, and its unspeakable sexual and racial politics turned You Only Live Twice into a no-go zone for me. What I can recall is that as me and my dad walked home down Ettymore Road, dusk was falling. I skipped from streetlight to streetlight, narrating my favourite scenes. And, to be fair, they’re still pretty impressive. The moment the piranhas that strip Helga Brandt’s flesh in five seconds. The helicopter-wielded super-magnet that lifted the baddies’ pursuing car and dropped it in the ocean. Bond chop-sockying incoming stuntmen without getting so much as a wrinkle in his Savile Row suit. That sequence in which 007 totalled choppers with flamethrowers dispatched from M’s latest gizmo, a flimsy self-assembly flying tricycle. What a guy. My dad and I would never measure up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1761df11d7793940f5a7b32ee611e5efcdf7a86b/0_276_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb1c8903ba9e73e042529bb533a7f7e","title":"sport.comment2","story":"The first words Fergie said at half-time were: ‘Get that kit off, you’re getting changed’It was a roasting hot day at The Dell. We didn’t have a great record there anyway, but this game went really badly - we were a goal down pretty quickly, and three behind by half-time. Obviously something had to change.I’m not sure if any of the players mentioned the kit. Personally I felt that we were playing really poorly, and that we couldn’t really blame anything or anyone but ourselves. Having said that, it was a bit tricky to see players. It was all right if you had a bit of time to look up and see what was happening, but you didn’t see much if you only had time to glance. I think the weather had something to do with it too - the fact that it was so bright made our dull grey harder to make out.Anyway, I don’t think anyone had time to complain. The manager just stormed in and said: “Get that kit off, you’re getting changed.” Those were the first words he said at half-time. I don’t think he liked the shirt anyway - our results had been poor whenever we wore it, and we certainly never played in it again.It seems a bit strange that we were ready with a totally different kit to change into, but maybe it’s because someone thought that the grey kit might be confused with Southampton’s - although given that they wear red and white stripes it doesn’t seem very likely. We wore blue and white in the second half, and played a bit better. I’d probably put it down to a mixture of the new kit and the manager’s hairdryer treatment at half-time. We didn’t let any more in and Ryan Giggs scored towards the end.The shirt is probably a collector’s item now, for all the wrong reasons. I think my dad’s got mine. He’s got all my old shirts. I feel sorry for anyone who’d bought the replica, because it was out of date pretty quickly. There was lots of hype about the kit change for a while after the game, because United were always bringing out new kits, but I think it passed us by. I know it was blamed for the defeat but I think we took responsibility for it as a team.Given a choice, I’d say our all-black away kit was my favourite, followed by the all-white one we played in for the Cup-Winners’ Cup final in 1991. Simplicity is important for me, I suppose.Manchester United lost four and drew one of their five (or four and a half) games in the notorious grey kit. It was officially retired two days after this game, and they proceeded to win every remaining fixture to take the title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0700d277bd83affd91d60c6b1e12500477ca113e/0_173_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d3cfc0a31f82a57e01f8e378415077","title":"its a very worrying time sri lankas recovery interrupted by coronavirus","story":"As the anniversary of the bombs that shook the country looms, survivors working to build harmony face multiple challengesA year on from the Easter bombs that killed more than 250 people, Sri Lanka is now under pandemic lockdown and facing rising pressure.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose decision to include iniduals accused of atrocities during the country’s 25-year civil war among his political appointments has been a source of international opprobrium, is now under fire over the country’s repressive, militarised response to Covid-19.With tensions increasing, and parliament and courts suspended, a civil society that had been working hard to rebuild trust and harmony from the ground up is struggling.It was 21 April 2019 when three large bombs targeting Christians and tourists were triggered.Hasaru Jayakody was at mass in Negombo, where 115 people would die, including his mother Priyanthi whom he describes as “the best person I ever met”. Badly injured, he spent his 17th birthday in hospital.A statue of Jesus, spattered with blood, has been preserved in a clear box as a poignant reminder for the people of Negombo, who over the past year have been working to come through the trauma together.The physical environment has been rebuilt. The parish priest, Father Manjula, has supported efforts to repair trust by reminding his congregation that their God tells them to forgive. Jayakody initially found he needed to keep talking about what had happened. It was from his mother’s example, he says, that he learned how to forgive. Jayakody now teaches younger children at Sunday school and hopes to become an engineer in honour of his mother.But the wider environment is challenging. In the immediate aftermath, some Muslim businesses were boycotted by Sinhala or Buddhist customers – until leaders came together through local inter-religious committees, reinforcing messages of harmony and emphasising the right of all to live and work in Negombo.When refugees faced physical attacks after the bombings, human rights activists like Ruki Fernando stepped in to protect them.“In the context of large numbers of dead, injured and the magnitude of the tragedy, refugees didn’t receive much attention and support from the government, media, religious leaders and overall, Sri Lankan society. But some politicians and government officials were sympathetic and mindful of their duties,” he says, remembering how the Negombo police station sheltered a large number of refugees at the height of unrest, despite being overstretched.Harassment of Muslims had happened before, but the problem increased after the attacks. As some landlords and hosts were pressured to evict them, human rights groups worked with communities to support those at risk, opening their doors and providing food and medicine.Now with the current fears and restrictions, Fernando is worried about vulnerable communities such as refugees, prisoners, the poor and minorities.“We are seeing both racism and authoritarianism raising their ugly heads in the middle of the fight against Covid,” he says.Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at Colombo’s Centre for Alternative Policies thinktank, is also concerned.“What we’ve seen is extremely worrying. For nearly a decade in the run-up to last Easter Sunday we didn’t have to worry about security issues at such a scale but, since the bombings, we’ve seen a continuation of the securitisation,” she says.While conceding that this month’s parliamentary elections had to be postponed due to the outbreak, she is worried that there is no check on executive power.“It’s a very, very worrying time in Sri Lanka,” says Fonseka.“This has not happened overnight … but if we continue to postpone parliamentary elections then there are worrying signs over whether we are heading towards autocratic rule. “When we mark one year on from the Easter Sunday attacks, in this current uncertainty, has there really been healing and reckoning of what happened?”Jehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council, runs awareness programmes, educating communities about the origins of the civil war, how to build peace, and the issues involved in transitional justice. Perera acknowledges the support of senior international religious figures to help bring the communities to dialogue.In the immediate aftermath, there were claims that Sri Lanka’s Muslims knew the bombing was planned and had let others down by not warning them.Perera believes in the power of people of different faiths meeting face to face. It’s harder to sustain distorted beliefs when a community is gracious towards you, he says.“When they see each other as iniduals, there’s a lot of goodwill,” says Perera. “It’s when people put ideas into their heads in the abstract, then it’s easy to build anger”Over the years he has seen unfounded accusations that a Muslim surgeon secretly sterilised Sinhalese women, and now claims that certain groups are responsible for the spread of Covid-19. Burial practices of different faiths during the outbreak are controversial.For Perera, the coronavirus outbreak is a call for unity, not more ision. “Covid is infecting anyone without any discrimination,” he says. “We must not think on these isive lines but face the problem together.“Unless we are all secure, none of us will be secure, and that is the message that Covid is bringing us one year after the Easter bombings.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23dfc06e1814930c6e609fa0bef03922598bdc5b/0_126_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e489234bb1281f6984f9c68d1cb85886","title":"paraguay coronavirus hungry social inequalities","story":"Early, aggressive measures seem to be controlling the disease but the pandemic has laid bare the country’s social inequalitiesWhen Covid-19 arrived in South America, Paraguay was one of the first countries to take measures to contain the virus, closing schools and banning public gatherings after just the second confirmed case on 11 March.The nationwide lockdown seems to be controlling the spread of the disease, but it has created another problem: large numbers of Paraguayans are going hungry in their own homes.Paraguay has reported some of the lowest infection rates in South America – currently 129 confirmed cases and six deaths.But the government of President Mario Abdo Benítez has been heavily criticised for failing to support people left without income during the total quarantine – which is now coming to the end of the third week and is set to continue until 19 April.Sixty-five per cent of Paraguay’s workers earn their living in the informal economy and have no access to benefits during the coronavirus crisis.And while the government has been authorised to secure loans of $1.6bn to face the crisis, only a small part of a promised scheme of emergency payments of about $76 and food packs have reached those left in need. A further payment scheme is yet to be implemented.Valentina Osuna, a craftswoman and mother of four from the indigenous Qom village of Rosarino, said she was no longer able to sell her work.“There’s no support, there’s nothing from the state. My children are hungry.”Abdo Benítez has apologised for the situation and called for patience. But when he briefly boarded a public bus last week to greet passengers, he was heckled with demands for the promised support payments.The scale of the crisis has been shown by the recent launch of AyudaPy – an open-source, non-governmental website allowing users to request and offer help. Thousands of messages are being posted daily by people describing dire circumstances and requesting basic items like milk, bread and medicine.Óscar Pereira, member of a residents’ organisation in the deprived Tacumbú neighbourhood of Asunción, the capital, said: “The mutual solidarity on display is outstanding poor people are helping other poor people. We’re all helping and giving what we can: we’re cooking communally so that we can get food to people.”As it has across Latin America, the coronavirus crisis has laid bare social inequalities and the poor state of public infrastructure. Amid widespread outrage, the government has promised a reform of a state that is underfunded and plagued by corruption and highly skewed tax policies.However, for Alicia Amarilla, national coordinator of the Organisation of Rural and Indigenous Women, not even promises of reform can guarantee greater dignity for Paraguay’s many poor families.“We’re going to see many more difficult situations come from this crisis – we’re in a country with far too much inequality. We know that the government won’t take privileges away from those that have them. The people who are most in need are the ones who will continue suffering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac75bb928c6e1abc17bcc59e61b11210d531a22/0_74_5168_3103/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e64ccd9e759f2dca46f41dc28b1d39e7","title":"photographing povertys pandemic its a different beast in south africa","story":"In the first of a series focusing on the work of photographers during the coronavirus crisis, Jerome Delay trains his lens on South AfricaWe’ve become used to the images of western cities around quarantine. In the empty streets of industrial and post-industrial societies tightly connected by globalisation, absence has become one of the most powerful metaphors of the coronavirus.It’s a very different story in countries where inequality and poverty are much more acute where access to a safe and distanced space in which to isolate is limited by poverty, social status and economics, and intimate social connections have a different importance.As part of a series on photographing coronavirus in these places, we have spoken to photographers or asked them to submit their impressions of the images they’re capturing, and the challenges that they face in documenting the pandemic among the world’s impoverished.Jerome Delay, who is based in South Africa for the Associated Press, is a veteran of covering war, social conflicts and outbreaks of disease. Many of his images on the coronavirus outbreak have drilled down into how the disease, and the social disruption it has provoked, has been experienced by some of the country’s poorest citizens.Among Delay’s striking images are several depicting a roundup of homeless and sometimes drug-addicted South Africans, including a group rounded up and taken to the Caledonian sports stadium in Pretoria to be housed in tents.But if documenting outbreaks of disease – including Ebola virus – is familiar to him, more jolting has been the experience of covering a serious epidemic in the place he calls home.“One thing that helps,” he told the  by phone while waiting for permission to photograph inside a hospital, “is that I have three tours of duty doing Ebola.“The social distancing, the handwashing and keeping healthy, none of that’s new. The difference is that this is happening in my own town – to people around me, and to people who I know. So there’s no escaping from it.”In South Africa, like other places, the disease first appears to have arrived in force via those more connected to the international hubs of finance, business and globalisation.“One of the hotspots has been the financial centre, people who had travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore, places like that, and who had come back and gone to parties.”And if, as he notes, life has not changed much in well-to-do places like the suburbs of northern Johannesburg, where “people live indoors behind high walls”, that is not the case for those living in crowded poorer neighbourhoods or on the streets.“In the townships, even up to a few days ago, people would see me, a westerner, and shout: ‘Corona! Corona!’ because they thought it was a disease of rich white people. Now people ask if I know how they can get tested. It’s beginning to sink in.”While South Africa has been quick to introduce tough movement and isolation restrictions to control the spread of the disease, the prism through which that is viewed, in a country with a strong memory of the apartheid era, has been very different.“Some people are being forcibly removed home, to open spaces. Even if it is an informal shack it brings back some bad memories – that, and the police telling people to get indoors.”He describes photographing homeless people rounded up at the Caledonian stadium earlier in the month, at the beginning of the country’s lockdown.“All these homeless people, mainly drug addicts on heroin or whatever they can get their hands on, they were rounded up on the street in Pretoria and taken to the stadium, where there was nothing but a few tents to accommodate them.Among the more striking images from the stadium is Delay’s picture of Henry, who he found sitting in a rubbish bin.“I saw this guy in a trash can. You know, it’s starting to get cold here. When I first noticed him, he was sitting on it. Then his legs went inside. He was protecting himself.”Inevitably, perhaps, the conversation turns to a comparison with his three stints photographing Ebola, and his own personal safety concerns.“With Ebola you have a lot less chances of catching it. Unless you fall head first into a bucket of vomit next to the bed of someone who is dying, the odds of catching it are slim – but the chances of dying if you do are very high. With coronavirus the odds of catching it are very high, and the odds of surviving high.Delay catches himself. “But I’m in a bad age group. I’m 60 in a couple of weeks. I’ve had a heart attack. Basically, I’m in trouble if I catch this thing! So I socially distance from people, I maintain hygiene and I look after my health.”So what precautions has he been taking? “I wear a mask. The only problem is that there’s a shortage of masks and it’s been difficult bringing masks into the country.“So we’ve been looking at ways to reuse the better quality ones we have. The one I’m wearing now, I’ll put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then I’ll hang it up for 72 hours. I wash my hands every five minutes and try to keep my distance.”One issue for the photographers is navigating the warning not to touch one’s face in a profession that involves repeatedly holding a camera up to the face.Delay says he cleans his cameras constantly. “I’ve got gallons of sanitiser I ordered online when the virus first popped up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa3caf980e87656f7c6afb966cc95bb76639ea4/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=356796615c72723d4fb92f5f1980bedd","title":"were taking matters into our own hands bracing for impact in kenya","story":"Homegrown efforts are boosting preparedness, but they need to be strengthened before the pandemic gathers forceWhen Covid-19 hits Africa, will we be ready? This was a distant thought just one month ago. Now, as cases climb, we are braced for impact.As the crisis deepens in the world’s largest economies, taking up most of the media bandwidth, Africa hardly makes the headlines. In international news outlets, the idea of crisis in Africa is met with resignation, not outrage. It is almost as if the media perceives crisis as the status quo in Africa, something expected. Unavoidable.Kenya’s cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, has cautioned: “We are praying and hoping for the best, but clearly we must also prepare for the worst. And mentally we must prepare ourselves to face an insurmountable situation.”To date, only a handful of countries have successfully “flattened the curve”, controlling the outbreak so that it doesn’t overwhelm their healthcare system. We now know this is possible, and what it will take. So we must ask ourselves – what more can be done to strengthen prevention and readiness efforts where coronavirus has yet to take hold? We must do more as a global community to ensure the third wave is not the deadliest and most destructive.Kibera, like all slums, is a transitory place where people come and go between their families’ ancestral village and the promise of economic opportunity in urban centres. Raised in a 10-by-10 shanty room with seven siblings, we had no concept of personal space or time alone. Hygiene was poor, our toilet was shared by more than 50 households.Today, despite all our efforts, thousands of Kibera’s families live in the same circumstances alongside poor sanitation. With up to 250,000 of the world’s poorest people living on 2.5 sq km of land, there is no way to practise “two-metre social distancing”. in Kibera and among the world’s one billion slum dwellers, our best bet is to try to prevent an outbreak we know this is virtually impossible but it’s our only hope and we have to try. In a pandemic such as this, the fate of urban slums will impact the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus on a national scale.The head of the World Health Organization (WHO,) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that Africa must wake up to the coronavirus. Vulnerable communities like mine are heeding this call, working around the clock, scraping together resources to do everything they can to keep the virus out. It is time for international leaders to step in with support that can reinforce community-led efforts. Even modest investments such as cash payments to slum dwellers and improving awareness, testing efforts and food support would go a long way towards containing and slowing the spread. As I write, there have only been 197 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Kenya with eight deaths but where will we be in a month’s time, if the virus spreads the way it has in the developed world?In Kibera and other slums across Kenya, communities are taking matters into their own hands because when a community comes together even in the most fearful times there is hope. Community leaders are mobilising through Shofco, an organisation I founded as a 15-year-old boy who believed in the potential for communities to change their destiny. Together we have set up handwashing stations at every entry point to the slum and are running door-to-door campaigns to raise awareness and distribute bleach, homemade soap and hand sanitiser while combating rumours and misinformation.In partnership with the government, ministry of health and other locally based organisations, we are doing all we can to prevent the outbreak from decimating some of our most vulnerable communities. We know that if and when we face the full force of the virus, our fate is intertwined with one another, our city and our nation as a whole. This is a fact that we will never forget.The fear in my community is palpable. Joan, a resident of Kibera, says: “When I hear of corona I see death has come to Kibera, it’s a disease that spreads quickly and hurts. Because of our living conditions, it will spread fast. Many of our people have underlying conditions like HIV, blood pressure, there are orphans without good nutrition and very poor families. They say corona kills those with poor immunity, so we will all be at risk of a quick, sudden death.” We have seen the alarm bells sounding around the globe. It is my plea that the international community seizes this opportunity to strengthen a successful homegrown effort that can teach valuable lessons in preparedness, rather than waiting to mobilise only after massive devastation has taken place.From Kibera, from communities like mine, i hope the world learns that we are capable of keeping ourselves safe, clean, safe and protected. Community-led efforts must be allowed to start and to lead the way.• Kennedy Odede is CEO and founder of the charity Shining Hope for Communities (Shofco)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb29b927caea05900813706830f7ebfb9a8bb182/0_406_4066_2439/master/4066..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72217b6005bb0bc46ed34389b0f20fb4","title":"brian greene until the end of time book interview","story":"In his new book, Until the End of Time, Brian Greene proposes there is an inner peace to be found by zooming out beyond this moment to the beginning of timeIn this moment of global crisis – when all future plans have seemingly been upended and the fragility of life illuminated with terrible clarity – there is much solace to be found in focusing on the present moment meeting each day, each hour, each meal as it comes. Yet, in Brian Greene’s new book, Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe, the theoretical physicist and author proposes that there is also a type of inner peace to be found by zooming out beyond this moment, this century, this millennium, back to the beginning of time and forward to the death of the universe.As well as offering lucid, detailed accounts of the science behind the big bang, the development of the cosmos, the emergence of life and human consciousness, and the inevitable extinction of the cosmos, Greene’s treatise is motivated by a personal search for equanimity. I recently spoke with the Columbia University professor about the consolations of a scientific perspective when confronting existential angst.You begin Until the End of Time by letting us into a desire that motivated you for a long time, which you describe as wanting to “catch a glimpse of the transcendent”. Was this search with you from childhood?Yes. And it came from an early recognition that we are not permanent, that we lead these finite lives, that we will all one day die. I think this realization hits kids in different ways. For me, it hit me in a sense where I wanted to be part of something that would be lasting, that would have a chance of being permanent.Why did you turn to math to find the answer?When I began to have this love of mathematics, it began to feel like this was the one thing in the world that you could really count on. Because once you prove a mathematical statement, it just is true forever, or so I thought.If much of your life was characterized by a desire to find permanence and meaning in math and physics, you describe in this book a moment of realization that everything, including math, is impermanent. Was this a difficult realization?Yes, absolutely. When I started using my understanding of physics to think about what the far future will be like, I began to realize everything, even mathematical truths, would at some level go away if there was no conscious being to reflect on them. And so that was a descent into darkness for me.But then you turned a corner while writing this book, right?Yes. In the very, very early stages of writing this new book I just had this moment of clarity. Ultimately I turned a sharp corner into a terrain that is very bright and very hopeful, which is the recognition of how utterly miraculous it is that we’re here at all. How utterly stunning it is that collections of particles can coalesce into things that think and feel and can create wonder and beauty and figure out deep mysteries. It was a real emotional shift.A question you pose in the book is: what is the best way to describe existence and reality? As a physicist, you say it is ultimately with reference to the physical laws of our universe. Does that mean you’re a reductionist?I am, but that term needs to be defined appropriately. My view is that reductionism gives you the undergirding for the fundamental ingredients and laws that underlie every process in the universe. But that doesn’t mean a reductionist framing is the right language for gaining insights into love and grief and aspiration and anxiety. Do I believe that those emotions and feelings reside upon the laws and the particles? I do. Do I think that the laws and particles provide the right language for deeply understanding those human qualities? I do not. We need to use the language that’s relevant to the kinds of questions that interest us.I enjoyed the chapter on the emergence of consciousness. As you make clear, the verdict is still out on what consciousness is, exactly. Do you have a preferred theory?The one that really seems most convincing to me at the moment comes from Michael Graziano at Princeton. He basically says whenever we engage with the world, our brain makes a schematic model of what’s happening in the world because it would burst at the seams if it had to include every single detail of everything that we encountered. So, we have these rough schematic models of everything that we encounter, including a rough schematic model of our own brain. Consciousness, he says, is nothing but the schematic representation that our brain holds of our own awareness.A fascinating and equally terrifying idea in the book is that consciousness and thought itself will eventually become physically impossible. What does this mean, exactly?The rough idea is that thought is itself a physical process that involves particles coursing through our brains. We know from the second law of thermodynamics that any physical process always generates a certain amount of heat, a certain amount of entropy, a certain amount of disorder. In the far future, the universe will not be able to absorb the heat produced by the very process of thought. So in that environment, any being that thinks one more thought will burn up in the entropic waste produced by the very process of thought itself. And at that point, thought will no longer be able to take place.It is this idea that brings you, at the end of the book, to consider human life, and indeed all life, as something that will end. I’m wondering how much room for doubt you leave, whether despite everything that human intelligence or any type of intelligence will prevail, nonetheless?Do I have some doubt? I have doubt about everything. In order for me to make headway on understanding the far future, I rely upon today’s laws of physics framed in the equations that we currently have at our disposal, and I allow for the possibility that in the far future those laws will change, and the math will change. And if things change sufficiently, then of course, I have left the possibility that the conclusions that I draw in the book would be affected.So obviously, we’re in a time of discord and confusion and anxiety. What solace can people find in dwelling on these questions of eternity and the universe at a moment like this?Watching the news and hearing what’s happening and speaking to friends, I have that deep foreboding, I have that deep sense of tragedy that’s looming and growing by the hour and it is deeply painful. At the same time, I find it useful to take a big step back and see all that we encounter within this larger cosmological story that does go from the big bang and sweeps through today and on to what we could call eternity. And within that larger sweep, I do gain a certain kind of calmness, I do gain a certain kind of a footing that I have difficulty achieving when I’m solely focused on the moment to moment, the day to day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f71d41678085def4b6d9f13fe6cfb3f7525fd5/109_207_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01a4f71b8c16a880e8db01d647ea0ca","title":"how we met within hours i knew i would marry her","story":"Santiago and Gisela Klein, 55 and 48, met on a beach in Uruguay in 1994. Originally from Argentina, they now live in HertfordshireIn January 1994, Santiago Klein was taking a break from city life with a beach holiday in Uruguay. “It was a popular place for people living in Argentina to visit. I started talking to Gisela’s sister because she knows my sister,” he recalls. It wasn’t long before the pair were introduced, and he asked if she wanted to go on a date later that day. “I noticed her eyes at first, and I really liked her.” They arranged to go out at midnight. “In Latin America, we go out late and stay out until 5am,” says Santiago. “I went out for dinner with my family first and they asked about my date but I couldn’t remember her name. I just knew there was something about her I really liked.”Keen to impress his date, he admits he was showing off at the start. “At first, I thought he was a bit full of himself, but I soon realised he was really down to earth and lovely,” says Gisela. “I went home and told my mum and auntie that I’d found the man I was going to marry.”Santiago felt the same way. “We had lots in common and wanted the same things in life. In the space of a couple of hours I knew I would marry her.” Though they were both coming out of long-term relationships, something felt right between them. “I had never thought about marriage before and suddenly I just knew,” says Santiago.A few days later, he returned to Buenos Aires for work, while Gisela continued her holiday. “He came back to Uruguay a week later and he proposed,” she says. “We went to a market seller there and he bought the rings.”Gisela was also living in Buenos Aires at the time, and the pair returned to the city together after their travels were over. “I joke that she comes from the posh bit of the city, like Chelsea in London,” says Santiago. “And I am from the equivalent of Hendon.” The couple arranged their wedding for 6 November 1994, exactly 10 months after they met. “We wanted it to be the same day of the month,” he says.Before the wedding, the couple had to tell their parents about their plans. “We went for dinner with my family and we just kept on ordering more food,” says Gisella. “He was so nervous about telling them.” Eventually Santiago plucked up courage. “My father-in-law looked at me, finished drinking his coffee and then said: ‘I knew you would marry her I just thought you’d wait a bit longer.’ They’d only known me for about 15 minutes.”Since they married, the couple have had three children, Freddie, Maggie and Max. They have lived in both the UK and the US, moving around for Santiago’s work in property development while Gisela cared for the children. The first move came in 2001, during a period of riots and instability in Argentina. “Things weren’t good at home, so when Santiago suggested the move I thought ‘Why not?’,” says Gisela. She admits life in the UK was hard at first as she spoke no English and had young children. “Over 10 years, I learned to really love it.”In 2010, the family moved to Florida. “We knew it wasn’t going to be for us long-term,” Santiago says. “We said we needed to move back home but neither of us knew whether that meant Argentina or the UK.”They moved to England again in 2016. As well as having plenty of friends in the UK, Gisela says they love the “fairness” of British society. “It feels like a caring place to live.” But they visit their family in Argentina as often as they can – and at Christmas and New Year they return to the beach in Uruguay where they met.Santiago says their marriage has always felt right. “She complements me so well. And I have always loved the way she smiles with her eyes and not just her mouth.” Gisela has always known that she and her husband were meant to be. “He has lots of regrets in life, but he always says he has never regretted marrying me, not once.”• Want to share your story?

This week: a horse chestnut in OxfordshireWe moved to Chilton village in the Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, about 10 years ago and discovered this rather wonderful horse chestnut tree on a walk. It was standing on its own, casting a deep shadow across our path in the evening sunshine.As we looked up, it was difficult to grasp its size as the branches disappeared up into an ever more complex maze, with only the occasional dappling of sunlight through the gaps in the leaves to illuminate the way. The trunk had lots of small twig-like growths, which gave the impression that the tree had hairy legs, while the huge canopy resembled a vintage Kenner Tree Tots Treehouse playset.It looked very settled and ancient, and as we gazed up we were drawn into its calm.

Then I found a bottle of her scent Over the past 27 years, my mum has been by my side through thick and thin. She is my best friend, my inspiration and my rock.I live with my husband, but my pre-Covid-19 days were regularly filled with quality mother-daughter time. We would travel to work together, grab a bite to eat in between meetings, and every Tuesday night, we’d go ice skating together at Alexandra Palace, in north London, sharing a passion she passed down to me. But most importantly, my mum has accompanied me on my anxiety journey.For the past eight years, I’ve suffered with general anxiety disorder, which although controllable with certain techniques, has meant panic attacks, irrational fears and a lot of crying in my mum’s arms. But knowing that she has been present through my challenges and self-help discoveries has always filled me with calm.When lockdown started, my heart sank: I knew I wouldn’t be able to see her. Suddenly, instead of our uplifting face-to-face conversations, I found myself offloading my coronavirus anxiety, intense claustrophobia and sleep deprivation on to her via FaceTime.Last week, having significantly more time on my hands than usual, I decided to sort out my perfume cupboard, reordering my bottles into fragrance families – the florals I would one day wear to summer events, the aquatic beach scents I would sport on future holidays and, last, my everyday picks. I enjoyed spraying these and escaping lockdown life, if only for a few hours.Despite being a fragrance fanatic, I have not been spritzing my signature scents much during lockdown. Maybe because I’ve not felt myself lately or perhaps it’s just not felt appropriate to spray perfume each morning: it feels like the equivalent of wearing a full face of makeup to a sombre event.As I scanned the fragrances I once obsessed over, I felt empty and disoriented. Then, reaching for the back of the cupboard, I picked out a bottle I had never opened.It was my mother’s perfume, L’Occitane Néroli \u0026amp Orchidée Eau de Toilette, in its elegant bottle complete with a pink bow. I remembered she had picked it up for me and shamefully I had never used it.Sitting on the floor and spraying it on to my wrist, I immediately felt my mother’s presence. Memories came flooding back of baking cookies in the kitchen, walks in flower gardens and ice-skating together on a lake in Austria.It’s known that fragrance has a unique ability to uplift and encourage happiness as our brain associates certain smells with positive associations and emotions, but I was stunned to feel the warmth and comfort of my mum’s embrace after just one spritz.Since then, I have been wearing her fragrance every day, topping up every few hours and inhaling deeply. In lockdown, fragrance has become less of a luxury product and more of a therapeutic go-to that feeds my soul. It’s an invisible connection to her in a bottle.Not only has this new perfume routine worked for me, but it’s also put me in a more positive space to start and finish the day. Wearing my mother’s perfume has brought me closer to her than ever before and given me a glimpse of hope.

He had been living at the embassy for nearly seven years.Assange has since been held in Belmarsh prison in London, where he is serving a 50-week jail term for violating his bail conditions. He is awaiting an extradition hearing on 18 May on behalf of the US, where he is wanted for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks and likely facing espionage charges.In a statement to the courts supporting an application for bail, Moris revealed that she met Assange in 2011 when she was a legal researcher and looking into ways to halt Assange’s extradition.“Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his,” she wrote.In 2015, Moris and Assange began a relationship despite the “extraordinary circumstances”, she said, and became engaged in 2017.She said she had gone to great lengths to protect the couple’s children from the climate that surrounds Assange, adding that she was making the statement now because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die.According to Moris, Assange is in isolation for 23 hours a day and all visits have stopped.“My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed – of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together,” Moris said.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Moris said Assange had watched the births of both children in London hospitals via live video link and met Gabriel after he was smuggled into the embassy.She further revealed that both boys had visited their father in prison, and that the couple were planning to marry, whether Assange is released or not.Friends and supporters of Assange, among them celebrities including Pamela Anderson, have said he has been in poor health for many months and have expressed growing concern for his wellbeing since the coronavirus outbreak.HMP Belmarsh has repeatedly come under scrutiny in recent years, lastly after a remand prisoner was found dead in his cell in January, triggering an investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman.The man was the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh within the past year. Another inmate was found dead there in November.A judge at Westminster magistrates court rejected the request for an adjournment of Assange’s extradition hearing in May until September over what his legal team said were “insuperable” difficulties preparing his case because of the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/515ae40d8a463e6812d5463c7ffe0d89fed8751d/0_57_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b95ec34787d9527d2ad566a52022848","title":"grace jones where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians.

It makes complete sense then, that a well-curated anthology (including extended, nightclub-facing mixes) would beat any studio record.This double album, complete with outtakes and hard-to-find single versions, provides an unbeatable introduction to the work she recorded during an imperial phase ning 1980 to 1982, when she made the albums Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing and Living My Life. The title takes its name from the Compass Point studios in the Bahamas, set up by Chris Blackwell of Island Records in 1977, which had a solid reputation from hosting such heavyweights as ACDC, Judas Priest and U2. Beyond rock, it developed a fearsome parallel reputation for producing killer reggae-influenced pop and disco albums thanks to the incredible house band, the Compass Point All Stars, formed round the stellar core of Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Mikey Chung and Uziah “Sticky” Thompson. Out of the many acts who worked with them, including Tom Tom Club and Black Uhuru, their work with Jones remains the peak achievement.Few musicians celebrate their 60th birthday by making one of their best albums after almost two decades away from recording, but that’s what Jones did with Hurricane in 2008. It’s a vital piece of work that engaged with the post-trip-hop end of dubstep, the not inconsiderable legacy of Massive Attack and a hitherto unexplored familial connection with evangelical gospel song. Her radiation of a timeless vigour was reflected in the release of the reworked and remixed Hurricane Dub in 2011. Crucially, however, Hurricane displayed a clear link back to Warm Leatherette, not just in terms of sonic texture and groove, but also in the luxurious presence of the Compass Point All Stars.Slave to the Rhythm (1985)After finishing the Compass Point trilogy in 1982, Jones took a break from recording to concentrate on her acting career. She broke the three-year hiatus by embarking on a short but productive relationship with ZTT. A concept album of sorts, Slave to the Rhythm, is a collection of wildly different versions of the same song. As befits a project devised by Trevor Horn at the height of his pomp (initially for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who rejected it), the album is a delightful synthesis of the sublime and the ridiculous. For example, opening track, Jones the Rhythm, features Ian McShane (AKA TV’s Lovejoy) giving a sonorous reading from Jungle Fever, the autobiography of Jean-Paul Goude, the French photographer and designer. Why? Because it was 1985, that’s why.The mid to late 80s was such a period of acceleration when it came to dance music that Inside Story ended up dating quickly. Looking back now, we can see house music lurking just around the corner, whereas producer Nile Rodgers of Chic clearly couldn’t. The booming chassis of gated reverb drums married to pristine, trebly rhythm funk guitar may have been slightly behind the curve when it landed in 1986, but now, decades after the fact, it just sounds superb. Jones had already proved herself a great songwriter on tracks such as Nipple to the Bottle, but here she got to push herself across the full album, ranging from the rampantly pumping I’m Not Perfect (But I’m Perfect for You) to the considered Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician.The Balearic Sound of Grace JonesAs befits someone with such deep roots in disco, Jones’s back catalogue is studded with nuggets of DJ gold. This completely unofficial bootleg does a great job of rounding up four killer cuts on vinyl for those who can no longer afford to track down the originals. To hear the godfather of DJing and remixing Tom Moulton getting busy with the razor blade and reels of tape on the extended mix of La Vie en Rose is a proper dancing-barefoot-on-the-beach-as-the-sun-comes-up moment. The selection is bookended by the equally brilliant Larry Levan garage mix of Pull Up to the Bumper, which effortlessly introduces the wide open avenues and heat haze of high summer in New York City to any environment with a big pair of speakers.State of Grace, by Miranda SawyerAfter a bottle of wine and several shots of sambuca, Sawyer, who delivers a typically brilliant profile, gets much more than she bargained for from Jones.I’ll Never Write My Memoirs, by Grace Jones and Paul Morley“I was born. It happened one day, when I least expected it …” Thus begins the suitably bombastic, self-regarding and slightly brilliant autobiography of Miss Jones, written with some assistance from her old ZTT pal Paul Morley.As Much As I Can, As Black As I Am by Barry WaltersSubtitled The Queer History of Grace Jones, this clear-sighted, well-researched piece looks at the cultural significance and importance of the singer in the context of gay disco culture.

Some staff are now working remotely or self-isolating but so far, so good. Those of us travelling into the offices are worried. No one wants to take this virus home to families, and whatever precautions we put in place there is still that thought in the back of our minds.I check the post and see something that looks like a National Insurance number for a resident. She has been waiting several weeks and without it her first benefit payment won’t be released. I let the woman know – she is relieved.I sign a food bank voucher for a family who arrived a week ago (thankfully they are still operating). Then we have our daily virtual check-in as a team. We talk about how difficult everyone is finding social distancing, especially with the toddlers who just want to run up and hug you.It’s exhausting work at the best of times, but now even more so for those people who are physically in the refuge. Those off site feel guilty about not being there they see how hard it is and really want to help, but their health has to come first. We talk through these feelings at our virtual staff meetings.A colleague from a nearby refuge belonging to the charity I work for tells me a family has arrived with symptoms of coronavirus. The mother didn’t know if they would be accepted, but she was so pleased to be offered a self-contained unit for herself and her children to recover in away from other families. A resident’s mental health has declined significantly since the lockdown. Without college, volunteering and face-to-face counselling, she is struggling. We are concerned she is getting caught up in the past and the emotions that go with the abuse she survived. I get in touch with our local housing team to find out what their plans are. They confirm they are operating remotely using telephone interviews, and that viewings and temporary accommodation allocations will go ahead with appropriate precautions. I dial into a meeting hosted by the local authority. Everyone is relieved to hear that refuges are still running, taking referrals and bringing in families in need.A resident asks about an email she has received from her solicitor she has been granted her leave to remain, but she can’t pick up her new biometric card until the solicitor’s office is open again.A five-year-old comes into the office to make a call to a staff member who is shielding. I hear him say “I miss you so much, have you gone forever?”. We get a big delivery of craft resources to share between all the families in the service. The children and family worker was going to come in to sort them out but she has developed a cough so needs to self-isolate. The children are getting increasingly restless so I start iding out resources into bags while taking other calls.In the staff catch-up we talk about referrals and how many more women we are seeing. We all think this will increase in the weeks to come. As not all move-on options are available for women, we are getting full quickly.I install a wifi booster. The teenager downstairs is very relieved she has been struggling to upload her homework and as she is self-isolating she can’t use the desk in the main lounge anymore. I talk one mum through how to use the food voucher she has just received as part of the free school meals. English is not her first language and I have to stay a safe distance but we get there in the end.My colleague tells me the family with coronavirus are starting to recover. It’s heartening to hear how all of the other women came together to make the family meals and left them at their door. The department for work and pensions calls to update me on how they are changing their processes to deal with the 1m extra claims, and what the escalation process will be for agencies working with vulnerable people, including domestic violence survivors, to ensure they can access their benefits.I’m emotionally drained but feel really proud of my staff and the residents. My final job before I head home is to check all the families have enough cleaning supplies for the weekend.The author of this piece is a domestic abuse service manager for Hestia, a charity supporting adults and children in crisis.

On the other side of the world this weekend, England cricket fans have been reliving the drama of Stokes’s innings courtesy of both the BBC and Sky Sports replaying the match as live.The memories are still painful for Cummins – although not as agonising as on the night of the defeat when he received a text from the head coach, Justin Langer, saying he wanted them all to sit down the next morning and watch their implosion on replay.“The feeling around the group was: ‘What’s he doing? He’s got this one way off,’” Cummins recalled. “I remember getting the message and I thought: ‘C’mon, we’ve all gone through this, just give us a day off.’ Everyone had played it over in their head a hundred times that night. I just remember thinking it’s better if we sleep on it, have a good day off, forget about it, and come together once we’ve all mellowed down a little bit.”The team, in T-shirts and baseball caps, gathered around a dark table in the boardroom of the Leeds Marriott hotel. Cummins sat towards the back, just in front of Nathan Lyon. “It was literally 15 hours after the last ball, so emotions were still high. That was the context of the meeting, everyone was still hurting.”As the 10th-wicket partnership between Stokes and Jack Leach was played out, Langer interjected to question tactics. He openly chided the captain, Tim Paine, for allowing Stokes to keep the strike when they needed to be attacking Leach. Paine said later that he found it hard to confront making mistakes. If Cummins, as vice-captain, felt any awkwardness on Paine’s behalf, he doesn’t admit it.“That’s the culture we try to breed into the team,” he says. “If you feel something, say it. And that’s the good thing about Painey and JL. They don’t mind going toe to toe if they have to.”The match is captured in a documentary that follows the team throughout the Ashes. Even though Australia went on to retain the urn at Old Trafford, the footage makes for grim viewing as far as Cummins is concerned.That might be the feeling now, but it is unlikely Cummins would have settled in to watch another replay had he been visiting the UK this weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801a921eec49f8dd97ae0deacb389a23a556fc44/0_89_3360_2015/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80131fe9d624ee9e2ac5d8eeaa27488c","title":"stirling moss great racing driver formula one ayrton senna","story":"The first British megastar driver, who set the model for those who followed, was a true sportsman and always great companyI still like to remember Stirling Moss considering the nature of his craft. “Speed is tranquillity,” he said, and that summed up his approach. His passion was the art of driving and it absolutely made him one of the greats. He drove using his instincts and while the facts may say he never won a world championship, in terms of the legendary names in the sport he is up there with the best, with Jim Clark and Juan Manuel Fangio, with Jackie Stewart and Lewis Hamilton.Moreover Stirling will also always be remembered as a true sportsman. He had very strong views on what was right and wrong in terms of how you conduct yourself both on and off the track. In that way he was a throwback to an era when the ideas of being generous in defeat, chivalrous and wanting to win fair and square were commonplace.I came to know him through my career, although I have no memory of the very first time we met, when Stirling came to my christening. My dad, Graham Hill, managed to persuade him to come and he was there with Bruce McLaren, Taffy von Tripps, Tony Brooks and the whole gang.We share the same birthday, and after I became an F1 driver our paths would often cross. As part of the British Racing Drivers’ Club he was very, very supportive of the work we were doing there. To say someone is a living legend is an overused phrase, but he really was. He could regale us with tales of racing in the good old, bad old days when it was absolutely lethal.During my career, I was very much aware of his weighty comments, his opinions of my own performance. A name like Stirling even commenting on what you are doing is nearly always good, unless of course he didn’t think I had been very impressive. Being Stirling, he was not afraid to give his opinion. He was very forthright, informed by his career and very pithy, but never unnecessarily negative and always a lovely guy, really great company.As time went on I got to know him even better through the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the British Grand Prix, the BRDC and even Sports Personality of the Year. I was once given the job of looking after Stirling, getting him up and down the stairs at Sports Personality and he was still as feisty as ever, even when he was a bit wobbly on his pins.After his accident at Goodwood in 1962, when he found he could no longer drive on instinct, Stirling was honest in calling it a day. That epitomised his attitude to racing. He would rather not have driven than to lack that sense of being at one with the car and being out there on the very edge.In that way he was very like Ayrton Senna and a lot of the greats. A seat-of-the-pants driver, attuned to his senses who managed to deal with the fear, to intellectually put it to one side. But he was also smart enough to realise that once that magic had gone he shouldn’t be doing it any more.During his time on the track he of course became a darling of the British public, through his performances as a driver, and as a winner. He gave Britain what they wanted, he symbolised hope for the future in a dashing personality. He went on to burnish that image of a British sporting gent, and even after he retired he was very good at giving people the racing driver that they wanted. Stirling always delivered the legend.There is great sadness at his death, but a quote of Stirling’s I enjoy from a book written about him back in 1963 still touches me today: “I took a very great deal out of motor racing but I put a lot back too, I do feel that I gave it all but my life.”Stirling was at heart a motor racing aficionado, a lover of the sport and a lover of driving.• Damon Hill is a former British driver that competed in Formula One from 1992-99, winning the drivers’ championship in 1996."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb2e1908718ed940c14051f97ece3bf8d740af0b/0_17_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c386d7387991f3a9f52627bc8962dc2b","title":"michael vick hall of fame question nfl football falcons","story":"You cannot tell the story of the NFL without Michael Vick. He is one of the most important players of this century, if not one of its bestMichael Vick’s career is one of the most fascinating, discomforting episodes in NFL history.Playmaker. Pioneer. Pariah. Famous then infamous. He is one of the most electric players to step foot on a field, and also one of the most controversial. An otherworldly talente who helped redefine what the quarterback position could be and helped pave the way for the likes of reigning MVP Lamar Jackson, Vick is as notorious for having served 21 months in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to his involvement in a dogfighting ring.It’s been five years since Vick retired from the league – or rather was retired by the league – which means he is now eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Responding to a Twitter question last week asking whether Vick should be a first-ballot selection, Jackson responded “This can’t be a question.”Jackson was putting voice to a generational ide. By the old rules, Vick is way off the Hall of Fame pace. But to a section of players and fans, Vick is the reason why they started watching or playing football. It’s why someone like Jackson was so convinced he could play the most important position on the field. And it’s why coaches believed in him. Why they saw he shouldn’t move from quarterback to running back or wide receiver because he was the best athlete on the field. Instead they saw he should be playing quarterback precisely because he’s the best athlete on the field.Without Vick, we may never have seen a full embrace of the pace-and-space style at the NFL level, which makes him and his career a fascinating test case for the Hall and its voters.Whether or not he should be enshrined in Canton is as much a discussion about what you think the Hall represents rather than solely an examination of the player himself. Are we rewarding the best players? The best careers? The biggest winners? Are we treating it as a museum, using the classic adage can you tell the story of the game without him? to determine who gets in and who is kept out?Every voter uses his or her own judgment, which makes the whole thing murky.Vick only hits one of the above categories. Since his playing days, he has emerged as the ultimate stats-v-eye-test guy. Ask a defender from his era which quarterback they feared playing the most and Vick will be right at the top of the list.One story stands out above all:Remember the 2002 Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team of Warren Sapp and John Lynch fame? The Bucs, along with the Ravens, were the most fearsome defense in the NFL in the early 2000s. It was a group littered with future Hall of Famers and All-Pros galore. In game-planning for Vick for a top-of-the-NFC-South clash, the Bucs defense honed in on the Falcons third-down package. They pulled up the tape. Boom. Boom. Boom. Vick was a blur. He was carving up defenses with his arm and legs. It didn’t just look easy, it looked like the quarterback was having fun. “Yo!” Simeon Rice, a four-time All-Pro called from the back of the room, “Is this a damn highlight reel?” It was not.Warren Sapp summed it up succinctly: “The best football I had ever before seen in my life.”Whereas the greatness of most quarterbacks is a little in the shadows – the game planning, the audibles, the setting and resetting of protections, the little wins that lead to a big completion – Vick’s was visceral. He was quicker and he could throw the ball farther than anyone. And he knew it, too, playing with all the swagger and style that made him a cross-cultural icon to a generation of fans who were done with the stodgy, conservative quarterbacks they were used to.Vick played in Atlanta at a time when the city was the center of the hip-hop universe. This was a place of Outkast and Ludacris and Lisa Lopes. “We did something great for the city at a time when times was changing,” Vick said in 2017. Atlanta fell in love with Vick the personality as much as the player. He became the face of EA Sports’ Madden NFL franchise. It was a seismic moment, indicating a readiness from the masses for a black quarterback as the face of the NFL. “Something black America had been awaiting for decades,” David Dennis Jr wrote for the Undefeated.Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, John Elway, Dan Marino, Steve Young, Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Brett Favre and Kurt Warner are the only quarterbacks voted into the Hall of Fame this century. Peyton Manning will be elected to the Hall of Fame in 2021, the same year as Vick. Tom Brady and Drew Brees will join them at some point in the next decade. All but Moon played in Super Bowls all but two won a championship. And none of them carried Vick’s baggage.Wading into Vick’s criminal record is a moral quagmire. When Vick was announced as one of four “legends captain” at the 2020 Pro Bowl, it was greeted by a petition signed by nearly 900,000 people. Vick has been able to rehabilitate himself within the game: he is a mentor to a bunch of young players and, as evidenced by the Pro Bowl, has been welcomed back by the league office as an official “legend”. But he will never be forgiven by large swaths of the public for his involvement in dog fighting.To answer the earlier question: You cannot tell the story of the NFL without Michael Vick. He is one of the most important players of this century, if not one of its best. But his career will be as much remembered as a series of whys and ifs the further we are removed from the highlights and the video games. And that feels right. His absence from the Hall of Fame will speak more appropriately to his career than his induction ever would."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf30cdbfdf0a7ef2e6c911b62dbe8012e405dca9/0_1307_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188bd6811f03cbd05cd7d4909559a119","title":"sir stirling moss motor racing legends life in pictures","story":"Stirling Moss, arguably the greatest driver never to have won the F1 drivers’ championship, has died.

The more I talked, the more I lost confidence. I sounded preposterous. What could possibly be appealing about the eccentric mix of fairytale, music hall and folk tradition I was trying to enthuse them with?As it happened, they loved it. Evidently, the joy of panto is beyond words. You just have to be there.In these days of coronavirus lockdown, however, being there is no longer an option. Which is why going online to watch Ryan McBryde’s production of Cinderella (★★★☆☆) leaves me conflicted.On the one hand, it’s a generous idea to share a show with housebound families for this Easter week – and a clever way to campaign for funds for the Mercury Theatre Colchester’s £9.8m redevelopment project.On the other hand, watching such an exuberant and interactive form in the solitude of your living room makes you feel oddly detached. It isn’t us shouting out our names to Mari McGinlay’s self-assured Ella when she asks us to introduce ourselves. It isn’t us getting peed on by the Ugly Sisters’ dogs as they carry them around in their handbags. And it isn’t us joining in a competitive bout of Get Me to the Church on Time before the final curtain.None of this is a massive loss, but it’s enough to take the edge off a classy production. Pantomime trades on controlled chaos, something that needs you in the same room as the unfolding anarchy. What must have seemed naughty, rambunctious and funny on stage too often feels tame on screen. As a result, the fairy-story romance between McGinlay’s no-nonsense heroine and Samuel Knight’s Prince Charming comes across best.As pantos go, this Cinderella is at the posher end of the scale. Less the rough-and-ready vigour of the music hall (although Mercury regulars Antony Stuart-Hicks and Dale Superville provide grit as the Ugly Sisters), more the polish of legit actors lending psychological depth to Andrew Pollard’s script. That’s when they’re not being put through their musical-theatre paces on the free-range soundtrack put together by musical director Nick Barstow. In one medley alone they go from Meghan Trainor’s All About That Bass to Rosemary Clooney’s Sisters.Ticking all the panto boxes, Pollard jazzes things up with a cross-dressing Dandini, going in disguise to improve her work prospects. It adds a touch of Twelfth Night playfulness, works in a spot of feminist commentary and gives an excellent Nerine Skinner the chance to exercise her comedic muscles. That’s in addition to providing an alternative love interest for Nicholas McLean’s Buttons. If we lose the poignancy of seeing him unlucky in love after Ella lands her prince, we gain in the pleasing symmetry of a double romance.The production dates from December, in that fairytale era when we took public gathering for granted. Rapunzel: The Lockdown Panto (★★★★☆), by contrast, is every bit in the here and now. Created by Regal Entertainments and St Helens Theatre Royal, James Lacey’s delightful show turns social distancing into an asset.Each cast member has recorded their part at home, so we get Abby Middleton’s spirited Fairy Anna(logue) guiding us through a story that splices together domestic interiors framed by cartoon palaces, towers and cuckoo clocks. With its mix-and-match cameras and simulated audience participation, it marshals a chorus-line of back-garden dancers in matching denim tops and a cast decked out in homemade props (check out the king’s pan-lid crown) to produce a show bursting with panto’s ramshackle spirit.After a dispute over stolen cabbages, Lacey’s bumptious Witch claims Olivia Sloyan’s Rapunzel as her own and brings her up in lockdown isolation, making sure to maintain her supplies of pasta, paracetamol and loo roll. It’s as daft as it is enthusiastic, cheekily aware of its own topicality even as it keeps a grip on the story’s urgency.Broadcast in 10-minute helpings through the week, it is a joyful act of resilience.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It delves in detail into some of the 1,500 fish species and 600 coral types that live on the 133,000-square-mile reef, to tell the story of one of Earth’s most bioerse ecosystems and the damage done to it by climate change – through interactive timelapses, videos, weather maps and even a “mantis shrimp vision” tool. As part of the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral, which investigates coral bleaching around the world, the Ocean Agency has created a series of 360 degree images on Google Earth (click through the tabs bottom left to fly between locations). Also try AirPano,which offers a glimpse of a multicoloured reef near Komodo Island in Indonesia via an interactive photo.Duuun dun. Duuun dun. Dun-dun dun-dun dun-dun … Perhaps nothing will ever beat that film when it comes to galeophobia-inducing experiences, but there are plenty of virtual ways of getting up close, too . The great white can grow up to six metres in length and reach a speed of 35 mph. It gets spine-tinglingly close in this 360 degree video in Guadalupe Island off Mexico’s Baja California, where the viewer sits just outside the cage. Elsewhere, National Geographic has created an immersive video of a face-to-face encounter with a hammerhead shark in the Bahamas. The Discovery Channel captured a whale shark – the largest fish on the planet- in 360 degrees. And the MythBusters team from the same channel also shot around 30 reef sharks together near the Bahamas’ Ray of Hope shipwreck, as part of a wider research project on sharks’ fears. If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of one on Exploreorg’s webcam stream in the Atlantic off Cape Fear, North Carolina.Swim with wild dolphins in a 360-degree video by the Dolphin Swim Club, created as a “cruelty-free alternative for so-called dolphin-assisted therapies with captive dolphins”. The research organisation has also developed waterproof UnderwaterVR goggles, allowing swimmers to experience virtual wild dolphins and associated therapeutic effects. In the Bahamas, the Dolphin Project calls for viewers to take the pledge, during its 360-degree video, not to buy tickets to shows that use captive dolphins. And BBC Earth’s Our Blue Planet VR video series includes an immersive virtual reality experience of bottlenose dolphins and oceanic manta rays. A marine biologist narrates the scene off the coast of Mexico, near San Benedicto island, and although filmed for 3D, it is worth a watch even without a VR headset.Exploring shipwrecks usually requires a ing qualification, but these interactive virtual tours take viewers into underwater sites without any danger. There are several 360-degree videos of exploration around New Zealand, including the HMNZS Canterbury, a frigate warship, sunk to provide an artificial reef and e wreck in 2007 and the MS Mikhail Lermontov, an ocean liner. The latter’s central staircase and starboard entrance collapsed after an earthquake in 2016, so this video is now the only way to see these features. Another 360-degree video tour with voiceover narration explores the wreck of the SS Thistlegorm, an armed Merchant Navy ship that was bombed in October 1941 near Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea, and is now a well-known ing site.There is something magical about sea turtles – they can hold their breath under the water for up to seven hours, the live to around 100 years old, and their favourite meal is jellyfish with seagrass. National Geographic shot this 360-degree video in Buck Island Reef in the US Virgin Islands, one of the first protected marine monuments in the US, created in 1961. It includes a rare glimpse of tiny hatchlings as they head from nest to sea at night. An Airpano video captures a larger adult sea turtle off Cuba’s largely uninhabited Jardines de la Reina archipelago in the Caribbean. Almost all species of turtles are now endangered, facing an increasingly difficult battle against a range of threats – from mistaking plastic for food to poaching and light pollution on the beach.Rays have the greatest brain-to-size ratio of any fish. The largest is the manta ray, which can grow up to seven metres in length. One of the best places to see them is Indonesia, as seen in this 360 video by AirPano, shot off the coast of Raja Ampat, West Papua, which captures one of the giant aquatic gliders over a reef. The Discovery Channel also caught a close-up immersive video of mantas swimming with whale sharks, and has a marine biologist explaining why anchor species like these are vital to the survival of the oceans. Often confused with manta rays, devil rays are their smaller cousin, with a mouth slightly under the face instead of in front, and pointier “horns”. This 360-degree video takes a dip with a group of them off the coast Santa Maria island in the Azores.They may not have a brain, a heart, bones or eyes, but jellyfish can be deadly. The gelatinous sea creatures have a “nerve net” controlling feeding, swimming and protective actions, and often a set of trailing stinging tentacles – which in the case of the near-invisible sea wasp, the deadliest jellyfish on Earth, can kill a human with a dose the size of a grain of salt. Capturing the less terrifying, stingless, medusa species, in a lagoon in Raja Ampat in Indonesia, AirPano’s 360-degree video takes viewers in among a vast swarm – known as a smack of jellyfish. Another hypnotic immersive video shows a singular pulsating translucent blob off Cuba’s Jardines de la Reina.The way fish move instinctively in coordinated unison is known as schooling, which is different to shoaling, when fish stick together for social reasons, such as defence, foraging or finding a mate. The shape of the schooling depends on the species - some form rectangles or ovals with back-and-forth swimming others move in tornado sequences. Showing a variety of formations, this AirPano 360-degree video shows thousands of caranx and other reef fish near Malpelo Island, 300 miles off Colombia’sPacific coast. Another set of still 360-degree images, shot in the New Caledonian barrier reef in the South Pacific – the longest continuous barrier reef in the world at 930 miles – shows hundreds more colourful reef varieties (click the white arrows to explore the site).With a brain in the middle of the body controlling the nervous system, and several million neurons in their eight tentacles (allowing them to touch, taste and move objects independently), octopus are, not surprisingly, highly intelligent animals. They have been seen unscrewing jars, carrying coconut shells as armour and stacking rocks. Try to find the octopus at the start of this 360-degree video by YouTuber Frédéric B – it is almost completely disguised and continually changes the colour of its skin as it darts around, camouflaging itself against the rocky seabed. A narrated BBC Earth 360-degree ing video (shot for 3D headsets where possible), descends with a e team at Browning Wall in British Columbia, Canada, passing giant Pacific octopus, a huge wolf eel out hunting, sea lions and starfish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/109f4ba2ff1bd6ed71fef0c95719c0f073a06fbc/0_0_4064_2440/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea94287e8ca8b9e52e530caae7b0034","title":"alex renton postcard from the future tiree island scotland","story":"My family has been visiting this Inner Hebrides isle for more than a century, but for now I can enjoy its peace and ease only in my mindLambing has started on Tiree, a friend there told me this morning. After another brutal, gale-pummelled winter, the little island is waking up. The machair, the great grass carpet that covers almost everything, has cowslips, primroses and wild hyacinths pushing up at the spring sun. But I can’t go. Caledonian MacBrayne won’t let outsiders on the ferry. My friend, self-isolating in her family’s croft, suggests a Facebook site that has video of an afternoon at a favourite beach: “Lie in your garden, close your eyes, listen to the sea and pretend.”As you approach it, the island hardly seems to be there at all. “The land beneath the waves” is just one of the old names for Tiree, a 10-mile scrap of dune, rock and grass to the west of Mull on the far edge of the Inner Hebrides. It does seem not much more than a wisp, a dream of an island, a piece of flotsam in the vastness of the Atlantic. There is nothing west of it until Newfoundland, 2,000 miles away. But when the ferry shoulders alongside Gott Bay pier, the place is real enough, though constructed mainly of fly-away things - fine sand, grass, wildflowers. Its most solid features are the sheep and the 600-odd hardy, friendly souls who live there, and the wind.I’ve been visiting all my life. All our childhood holidays were spent there, except for one disastrous caravanning trip round mid-Wales. Before the first world war, my grandmother, whose aunt lived there, played on the beaches and in the same rockpools where my children do. Maybe one day I’ll help my grandchildren make sand volcanoes, dig for cockles and start out on the surf at Balevuilin Bay. My children have got the bug - ask them where, anywhere in the world, they’d like to go for summer holidays and their answer is guaranteed.What is it to us, and the other people who love the place, visitors and islanders? Tiree is not like anywhere else, not even any other Hebridean island: that’s clear enough. In June it has more sun than almost anywhere in the UK, for a start. It is an escape, of course, a sanctuary place where a life expands, where your eyes rediscover the long distance, your nose the smells of a simpler world: salt-flavoured rain, warm clover, kelp drying on the beach, sun on a tarred roof, fresh mackerel frying in a buttered pan. We are city people pretending to be Highland crofters: your holiday is just a reality TV show, a friend laughed at us. Yes, not unfair: that’s how lucky we are.For all my life, Tiree has been most important when I haven’t been there. Working, worrying, in exhaustion or despair, it’s the place I go to in my mind for ease and peace, with the backstop of knowing that if things get tough, I can just get to Oban and jump on the ferry. Now, for the first time ever, I can’t. An Tirisdeach, the island’s fortnightly news-sheet arrives through my city letterbox with news that the Baptist chapel at Baugh has become an isolation ward - should need arise - and a charming editorial that begs Tiree’s friends and visitors to stay away. We mustn’t even go to help with the lambing. The editor promises the island will welcome us back, when the right time comes.• Alex Renton’s latest book is Stiff Upper Lip: Secrets, Crimes and the Schooling of a Ruling Class"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d6af1061d11c592d34a585a90771ae55dff44a/298_0_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bccaa72ac2f0cccf877bba801d27f438","title":"democratic primary joe biden bernie sanders 2020","story":"The coronavirus pandemic effectively ended the race but a historically erse field had faced off before narrowing to two white men in their 70sThe Democratic odyssey to choose a nominee delivered one final surprise this week: a predictable ending.Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the entire campaign season minus a rocky four-week interlude, is the last Democrat standing after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential bid on Wednesday.But the result belies what was, by objective measure, no ordinary quest for power. Epic in scale and rich in plot, the Democratic primary was at turns wild, chaotic and downright Shakespearean – all before the arrival of a once-in-a-century plague.Even in a Before Coronavirus world where politicians kissed babies and shook voters’ hands, the 2020 race included a historic impeachment inquiry, an unprecedented election night meltdown and a Hail Mary comeback.If 2016 was the year American politics fell through the looking-glass, 2020 is an improbable romp through wonderland.The Democratic primary race effectively ended where the presidential election will almost certainly be won: Wisconsin. But, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a messy, borderline dystopian experiment affair.Wisconsin forged ahead with its election in defiance of grave warnings from public health officials and more than a dozen other states that chose to postpone their primary over fears for voters’ health.So on Tuesday, thousands of voters waited in hours-long lines to cast ballots wearing protective face masks while poll workers relied on hand sanitizer and, in some cases, makeshift hazmat suits.Dressed like a surgeon in a blue gown, gloves and a mask, the Wisconsin assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican who opposed all efforts to stop in-person voting from taking place, swelled with pride at the scenes of Wisconsin residents fulfilling their civic duty in the midst of a deadly outbreak.“You are incredibly safe to go out,” he assured constituents with a confidence belied by his ensemble.Joe Biden finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada. With the weight of presidential history against him, the left-for-dead former vice-president looked to South Carolina for salvation.His fortunes began to change with an endorsement from Congressman Jim Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina and one of only a few political figures in America with the power to move votes with a single blessing.It was a blowout of epic proportions. He won every county in the state. Exit polls suggested that he won with white voters and black voters voters with a college degree and voters without one moderate voters and very liberal voters. Over the course of a remarkable 72 hours, Biden’s centrist rivals folded and aligned behind him in a dramatic show of force. He swept to victory on Super Tuesday – going from loser to winner in less than a week.In the end, South Carolina was far more than Biden’s firewall. It was a rocket-fulled jet pack that propelled his string of March victories and set in motion a political revival that longtime political observers swore they had never seen before.Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, spent nearly a billion dollars – that’s billion with a B – on a three-month presidential bid that triggered widespread fears – and plenty of criticism – that he might effectively buy the nomination.Bloomberg, the 16th wealthiest man in the world, spent lavishly across the US, hiring thousands of staff and flooding the airwaves and internet with endless adverts. His approach was unorthodox: skip the early states and run up the score on Super Tuesday.After rising steadily in the polls, Bloomberg won a place on the debate stage – where Senator Elizabeth Warren so thoroughly savaged his character and his record that she later claimed credit for drawing figurative billionaire tears – and earned a swath of negative publicity for his policies on minority rights as mayor and treatment of women as a media mogul.When the results rolled in on Super Tuesday, Bloomberg’s gargantuan effort yielded the grand prize of American Samoa. The US territory boasts a delegate haul of six, which he split four to two with the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Bloomberg promptly dropped out and endorsed Biden.But the saga of his failed experiment continues. Former campaign staffers are now suing Bloomberg for fraud, alleging that he tricked them and thousands of other employees laid off last month into accepting jobs on the promise that they would be paid until the general election in November. Now many are without an income – and health insurance – as they weather the coronavirus pandemic.At the lowest point of Bernie Sanders’ second bid for the White House, he suffered a heart attack. The political prognosis was grim: his campaign would never recover.Yet the “political establishment” – and the manifold other interests he rails against – had once again underestimated the Vermont democratic socialist.In a matter of weeks, the perennial underdog charted an extraordinary rebound. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him. The left rallied. His poll numbers climbed. Suddenly, days before the Iowa caucuses, national Democrats were in full panic mode: Sanders was a runaway train that must be stopped.Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa and then picked off New Hampshire. Then, in Nevada, his political revolution finally arrived. He won across the board, dominating with Latinos and first-time caucus-goers. For a brief moment, before South Carolina changed everything, Sanders appeared unstoppable, his ascent to the nomination inevitable. There are few political events in American politics as highly anticipated as the Iowa caucuses.Presidential candidates spend untold resources and time in this state, endowed with outsized powers to set the course of national politics. But this year, the state would not be remembered for choosing the winner of the first presidential nominating contest.Instead it was the site of a disastrous results reporting meltdown.Caucus day arrived and residents gathered at churches, schools and gymnasiums for this quadrennial display of democracy in action. Hours passed without any results. Rumors began to circulate that an app designed to record and relay the tallies of this byzantine process had malfunctioned. By then, the reporting hotline was overwhelmed with callers. As night turned to day, it was clear the caucuses had gone farcically wrong.The party did not officially certify the results until nearly a month after Iowans cacused. The Associated Press ultimately decided not to declare a winner.The screw-up was later attributed to a combination of technical difficulties and human error. But the state may never recover – with speculation that it may lose its first-in-the-nation voting spot. After rounds of recounting and re-canvassing, riddled by inaccuracies and inconsistencies, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was declared the delegate winner while Sanders won the popular vote.On the evening of the caucuses, with no data to betray them, a procession of candidates trotted on stage to declare some version of victory before jetting off to New Hampshire with every intention of never looking back.“Iowa,” Buttigieg declared, “you have shocked the nation.”Democrats have never had so many options for president. At its peak, the Democratic squad was large enough to field both sides of an entire soccer game, with subs.There were six women two black senators an Asian American entrepreneur promising everyone $1,000 a month a Latino former housing secretary a gay small-town mayor who rose from obscurity to political stardom a Hindu anti-war congresswoman two billionaires and a self-help guru who vowed to “harness love” to defeat Trump.But through it all two white men in their 70s – a former vice-president and the runner-up in the last Democratic primary – led the field for much of the race.And, of course, through all those ups and downs, the end result of that enormous field was the one that national polls had predicted from the start: Joe Biden won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5997654673256b2a320d401ae930e9a1688adb9b/0_132_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aacac89673a51c4fa75e86d6d0341b6","title":"us weather tornado louisiana texas mississippi storms","story":"Twister destroys hundreds of buildings in Louisiana while at least six die in Mississippi due to severe weatherIn northern Louisiana, up to 300 homes and other buildings were damaged. Utility companies reported thousands of power outages.The storm provided a dilemma for public safety officials trying to find a balance between wanting people to stay in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic and wanting them to leave their homes for shelter if conditions worsened.The American Meteorological Society, however, was unequivocal in its advice.Community shelters, the meteorological society said, should be a last resort.The Louisiana twister touched down in the city of Monroe at lunchtime, where officials posted to Twitter images of damage from a number of locations. Buildings and aircraft at the town’s airport were destroyed and managers closed runways to all air traffic.The National Weather Service (NWS) issued tornado watches and warnings for several states across the south, including Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, as the storm continued to march east.Severe weather warnings including flood watches were in place for parts of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, the Carolinas and as far north as Tennessee. In all, up to 20 states could see some effects, weather experts warned“Stay safe and weather alert – it is a dangerous day in Mississippi,” Reeves said in a series of tweets. “Please take today’s severe storms very seriously. Please take precautions to keep your family safe. We are working and watching closely. Stay safe.”Meteorologists said up to 95 million people could be affected by the massive storm through Sunday night and into Monday, with hailstones the size of tennis balls possible in places.“The severe weather threat currently over Mississippi will shift east into Alabama later this afternoon,” the NWS storm prediction centre said in a bulletin issued at 2.45pm ET.The storm, it said, was “likely to strengthen further as it moves into Alabama”, bringing more tornadoes, winds up to 70mph and heavy rains leading to flooding.In a live broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, told residents in some areas to seek immediate shelter as it confirmed a tornado on the ground in the state. It was not immediately clear if that touchdown had caused any damage.Associated Press contributed to this report.

My privilege is a reminder of a skewed societyThere’s been plenty of conversation about all the ways this pandemic has laid bare the brokenness of our systems: 27.5 million Americans without health insurance, the massive gaps in public health and healthcare funding, the two in five of us who couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency.To many of us, none of this feels shocking – we’ve been grappling with the depth and breadth of America’s systemic failures for years. My husband and I are some of those people without health insurance. Our family just moved into a new apartment contingent on my husband’s new job but it is non-essential and can’t be done from home, so he’s not working. His paid time off is set to run out soon.This crisis has also laid bare the privileges some of us are afforded. In New York, people of a certain class are escaping to their country houses. Secret money, a friend of mine calls this, when acquaintances who complain along with you about the difficulty of making it in a certain profession or paying rent in New York City, and then you find out they have an extra house and their kids go to private school. But also, in my experience these last few weeks, this pandemic has exposed the privileges that some of us still have, regardless of how broke we are.In addition to being under 40 and without any underlying health conditions, in addition to our educations and my ability to work from home, we have access to my husband’s brother’s wife’s family’s New Jersey country house right now. I keep saying all those things – husband, brother, wife – to people when I tell them that we left the city to prove, I guess, that we’re not one of those families who have secret country houses of our own.I have been embarrassed by this access, in the same way I’m embarrassed to have parents who have money, which is to say, I find people having things that they did not earn, or people having so much more than most, to be sort of abhorrent without always knowing why I feel that way. Privilege is abhorrent, I think, because of how fundamentally skewed and unfair its allocation always is.My husband’s brother and his family also live in the city but left a month before we did last weekend. They also have small kids and are trying to work. They also lost a lot of income when everything shut down, and none of us is sure how we’ll survive as this unfolds. We’re all trying to find ways to make our lives work in the same ways we’ve always tried to make our lives work, which is to say, on the margins, patching things together, with the help of friends and family, with kids in the background always somewhere needing things. We’re taking turns parenting and cooking. We know there is a risk in coming together, more bodies and more chances of infection, but we’re not leaving the property except one of us every other week for groceries. Whether or not this is the right call, we’ve decided that it’s worth the risk.A couple of days before we left, we’d taken the children for a walk, and, angry at me over something, our seven-year-old had threatened to lick all the fences that we passed to make me mad. It’s a relief now to take the kids outside without telling them that they can’t touch anything, to have more inside space for them to do their remote learning and for them to play.The day we left the city, I kept asking my husband if he felt guilty. Of course, he said. But I’m also just so scared. It felt like we were abandoning our city, our friends. This weekend I got two phone calls about two friends losing loved ones to this virus. Four friends have been laid off and three others have been furloughed. People are losing jobs and houses, taking the subway to work still, unable to feed themselves or their kids. Every day we’re here I feel guilty, but also, every day, I feel a little bit less scared.Of course, none of this wipes the other worries. There is still the rent for our apartment, my husband is now filing for unemployment there are still grocery trips. I worry that the ends will never meet again for us after this crisis. I worry that we might have to leave the city and move in with my husband’s family in Florida, that I might lose my various jobs as a result. But worry has a different shape, I guess, when you know for sure that the problem is too big for you to fix it. When the problem is so obviously less consequential than all the loss that you see all around.For a while I thought this essay was about gratitude. I am grateful. I wake up every morning both numbed and bolstered by how lucky our family has been so far. But our luck is only further to the point of how completely unfair, uneven and arbitrary survival feels in this present moment. I hope more of us realize that, for many people in this country, it has always been like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c173c0510ec2550b2604076cf13a132d9f12a97a/0_423_1270_762/master/1270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436a6aacf1da4d50073eb439fa83d8ed","title":"after coronavirus the penny has dropped that wellbeing isnt individual but social","story":"Our attitudes and rituals are undergoing a transformation during the Covid-19 crisis. Can we hope that a lasting good will come of it?Hannah Arendt once wrote that in times of deep crisis “we have a right to expect illumination”. It seems callous to suggest that this tenebrous pandemic is letting the light in, and daft to offer immediate consolations amid so much grief. But there is a sense that, with the world having ground to a halt, our fantasies are finally taking flight.Much of what we have always been told was impossible is actually happening: the homeless are (in some places) being housed in hotels while prisoners are (in others) being released. Kids are told not to go to school and to forget exams. Massive government spending is ensuring that people are guaranteed an income even if they can’t work. Private hospitals in Spain are being nationalised. A hospital has been built in London under a fortnight. In Portugal, tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been “regularised” and given full rights. It’s not quite a revolution, but it’s an epic conceptual awakening.In some ways it’s like a blissed-out stoner’s dream of what the world might be. The “Pianura Padana”, the flat plain of the Po valley, usually has some of the worst air pollution in the world. The air is now perfumed by spring. You can see the mountains. Two weeks ago we were singing Rino Gaetano’s The Sky Is Evermore Blue from our balconies.Realists have, rightly, tempered the utopian excitement and warned of a bleak future. Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we’ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like Hungary might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn’t inidual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We’ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay Health Is Membership) isn’t merely human, but also “its soil, its water, its air”.It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting social distancing (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we’ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent iniduals, and that community – for which we’ve yearned for so long – means originally simply a pooling of duties.The lockdown has made everything local. The world has got much larger and we’re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: “Find the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.” That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We’re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking.I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We’re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo – the only place our kids can play outside – with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.That centring has been mental as well as physical. It’s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman once wrote, an “electronically assured out-of-placeness”. We’re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn’t cope with the sudden stillness.It seems to me as if we’re all in a similar situation right now. We’ve come to an emergency stop, and it’s painful not just because we’re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we’ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we’re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a beautiful essay in Emergence magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is “serving as a flashlight – illuminating people’s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It’s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets…”It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: “We need another way, another world, but it’s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.”As we’re all pondering self-preservation, it’s inevitable that we’re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I’ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there’s an enforced detox from shopping. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we’re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids – it rips my spirit.As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek “spiritual satisfaction” in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We’re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It’s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities: “expelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels”.It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals – in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings – are currently mediated by screens. There’s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community’s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, “human activities themselves are sold and bought”.It’s as if the sacred “market” has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we’re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that “the state”, instead of “socialising and humanising the economy”, had allowed “markets to gradually economise and dehumanise society”. Even the Financial Times has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We’re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism’s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: “market fundamentalism”, he told me, has created “devastation and unbridled inequalities”.Globalisation has been a large part of the market’s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We’ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we’ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet’s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: “Anyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.” It’s so obvious it’s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. “The case for post-growth economics,” Rowson says, “just became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.”It’s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it’s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They’re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it’s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.Tobias Jones is the author of A Place of Refuge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f28084a3eb72748b41c99520cddcd5f8ed5012/0_60_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=639cc5f05ae6e96b640b4e232ff563dd","title":"coronavirus statistics what can we trust and what should we ignore","story":"The flurry of figures, graphs and projections surrounding the pandemic is confusing. Two experts guide us through the mazeThe past few weeks has seen an unstoppable epidemic … of statistics. The flood threatens to overwhelm us all, but what do all these numbers mean? Here are eight statistics you may see, with some warnings about how much we might trust them.1 The number of new cases each day This can be a very poor reflection of the number of people who have actually been infected, as it depends crucially on the testing regime – up to 9 April, 1.3 million tests had been carried out in Germany, versus 317,000 in the UK.2 The number of new deaths each day The range of sources is bewildering. The daily announcements should be treated with caution as they only include deaths in hospital of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, and there is generally a delay in reporting deaths of a few days or even longer. For example, while on 27 March the government announced that 926 Covid-19 deaths had so far taken place in English hospitals, NHS England now reports that the true figure was 1,649. The gold standard is the number of death certificates collated by the Office for National Statistics: it report at least 1,568 mentions of Covid-19 for all deaths up to 27 March, but this will increase as registrations come in.3 The total number of deaths Graphs of accumulating deaths are shown at the daily government press conference, but they are a hopeless tool for spotting trends: we need daily counts to see whether we have reached a plateau (which will not be a “peak”). But the daily counts are volatile, and so need some smoothing to bring out the underlying trends: World in Data uses a three-day moving average.4 Numbers recorded on a logarithmic scale This will have a vertical axis labelled 1, 10, 100, 1,000. These are useful for comparing trends, but useless for getting an impression of the magnitude of the problem.5 Predictions from models Computer models come in two types. The first tries to model the epidemic itself, by making simplified assumptions about the mechanism by which a virus spreads through a community. Key quantities, such as how many people an average case will infect, are highly uncertain at the start of an epidemic but are refined as more data is gathered. Such models have formed the basis for predicting the consequences of policy decisions in the UK.The second type of model is purely empirical, fitting curves to the observed data, and making strong assumptions about the shape of the curve to extrapolate into the future. These projections need to be viewed with extreme caution since they can be extremely sensitive to a few data points. On 9 April, US organisation IHME predicted an eventual 66,000 UK Covid-19 deaths but this had dropped to 37,000 three days later – it is difficult to take such modelling seriously. Model predictions should always acknowledge uncertainty, although this is rarely reported by the media.6 “Excess deaths” The number of extra deaths that will be recorded in this period, due either to Covid-19 or the lockdown, is hotly contested. Lives will be lost because of the illness, reduced medical care for everyone, domestic violence and the effects of unemployment and poverty and lives will be saved through fewer accidents and, particularly, improved air quality. A (disputed) fraction of those dying would have died anyway in the coming year, a phenomenon known as mortality displacement or even “harvesting”. But the overall effect is hard to predict, and confident claims should be treated with scepticism.7 The lethal risks of being infected These vary dramatically with age and frailty, just as “normal” risks do. In fact the current estimates for the general public (rather than healthcare workers) seem remarkably similar to the risks we face anyway each year – but all packed into a few weeks.8 The “accuracy” of an antibody test Even apparently accurate antibody tests can lead to many false assurances of immunity. But a less accurate test may be fine if we are testing a representative sample to estimate the proportion of a population who have immunity.Finally, it’s tempting to link a country’s statistics to the measures they have taken to control the virus: for example, has Sweden’s more relaxed policy been as effective as lockdown? But countries differ in so many ways: basic demographics, compliance and social networks, testing capacity and policy, health service characteristics and so on. Former prime minister Carl Bildt has joked that Swedes “have a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway”.Sylvia Richardson, director, MRC Biostatistics Unit, president elect of the Royal Statistical Society David Spiegelhalter, chairman, Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04094165692e202f98163bbb41947efa89cbe046/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c7d78322c524e8b3481232a5567b105","title":"documents contradict uk government stance on covid 19 herd immunity","story":"List of possible interventions included simulating impact of allowing majority to be infectedThe inclusion of “targeted herd immunity” as a possible UK government response to the Covid-19 pandemic – in a list of possible interventions considered for analysis by a contractor – appears to contradict strong denials by the health secretary 10 days earlier that it was any part of government policy.Matt Hancock gave that response on 14 March after two senior government officials had said publicly that achieving “herd immunity” was a key aim, prompting widespread alarm among medical experts that the British government was planning to allow the majority of the population to become infected.However, a proposed computer simulation of the impact of “targeted herd immunity” was contained in a planning document, used by NHSX and a technology contractor to map out the data response to the pandemic, around 23 March.While it does not appear the herd immunity simulation took place, its inclusion in a list of possible interventions raises questions about the government’s stance on the policy.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard, wrote in the  that such a policy would result in large numbers of people dying and the NHS being overwhelmed. He reflected the general bafflement among many experts, because “herd immunity” is typically achieved via widespread vaccination against a disease.There is no vaccine for Covid-19, and “herd immunity” without a vaccine assumes that the vast majority of people who recover from the coronavirus will then be immune, which has not yet been conclusively established.Hancock set out the government’s position in an article for the Sunday  on 14 March, explicitly denying that it was aiming for herd immunity. “We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.”Asked about the “herd immunity” concept on Andrew Marr’s BBC political programme the following day, Hancock emphasised: “Herd immunity is not our policy, it’s not our goal.”Yet still, by around 23 March, a planning document used by NHSX, the health service’s digital planning department, and Faculty, a British artificial intelligence company contracted to aid the response to the Covid-19 outbreak, included “targeted herd immunity” as one of several government “interventions” whose impact upon the spread of the disease could be examined via computer simulations.In a list headed “scenariosinterventions” that could be modelled, the document includes “intervention analyses” of policies such as social distancing and schools closures, which the government introduced incrementally from 16 March. Below those the document lists: “Targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population).”Later in the document, a list of interventions that “require no new simulation dynamics” of the computer modellers comprises social distancing, school closures, “targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)”, household quarantine and “area quarantine”.Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed herd immunity simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussion and never took place. In a statement, Faculty said it was “enormously proud” of the work it was doing for NHSX, saying its “visualisations and forecasts” would allow decision-makers to make faster and more informed decisions. “This work is saving lives.”The first revelation that the government might be looking to create “herd immunity” came on 11 March from Dr David Halpern, the chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, known as the “nudge unit”. No physical distancing measures were in place at that time all schools, workplaces, pubs, restaurants and social events were still open and going ahead, and the government’s only advice was that people with Covid-19 symptoms should self-isolate for a week.Some medical experts maintain that, in the absence of widespread testing of people and tracing those they may have infected, this remains the government’s policy: to contemplate most of the population ultimately becoming infected, and eventually achieve herd immunity.The DHSC did not respond to a question about why “targeted herd immunity” was listed on an NHSX document as a specific intervention to be modelled for its impact on the Covid-19 pandemic.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ee93eeb9a26a91ab48ec63d4077f8c7eae18d1/0_209_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379c2113b7b43908b97312b40f7c8e25","title":"easter passover ramadan festivals test the faithfuls resolve over lockdown","story":"Anglican vicars are not the only spiritual guides fighting curbs imposed on worship, with many flouting their government’s rules as more people seek solace in religionMembers of the Church of England are not noted for their resistance to authority. But during Holy Week, the most significant time in the Christian calendar, its leaders have faced mounting objections to its edict that all churches must close - even to their own clergy.Some prominent Anglicans have taken to social media and blogs this Easter to argue that churches must remain open, and that to lock their doors is to risk people’s spiritual health. Even Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London – a former nurse, and number three in the C of E’s hierarchy – suggested in a letter to parishes that vicars could live-stream services from their church buildings… before correcting herself on Twitter.Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, was forced to restate the reasons for church closures in a Facebook video last week. In a tone of rebuke, he said the church must “set an example”.All this was just a minor example of people of faith insisting on their right to worship in traditional ways in the face of near-global paralysis. Some of the most extreme have claimed they have ine protection, that the virus is God’s punishment for the sins of the world, or that it is a sign of the end of days.Perhaps the first example of religious organisations elevating their right to worship above the right of others to health came in mid-February in the South Korean city of Daegu. More than 1,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus prayed shoulder to shoulder in a windowless basement. In the congregation was a 61-year-old woman with a sore throat and a fever.Three days later, she became Patient 31, the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for Covid-19. By 1 March, some 2,200 cases – then about three in five of South Korea’s total – were traced back to the church.In the following weeks, as wave after wave of countries announced restrictive measures, evidence grew of resistance among some religious groups and organisations. In Bangladesh, at least 10,000 – some estimate 30,000 – Muslims gathered for a mass prayer session in the town of Raipur on 18 March. A religious leader in the town told people that, following the prayers, they would now be “free from the coronavirus”.A couple of weeks earlier, 16,000 people attended a four-day Islamic conference at the Sri Petaling mosque near the Maylasian capital, Kuala Lumpur. About 1,500 were from other countries, including China and South Korea. More than 400 coronavirus patients in Malaysia were later linked to the conference – and other cases in Brunei, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand were traced back to the mosque meeting.Friday prayers became a point of tension in Pakistan and Bangladesh, across the Middle East. The religious obligation for Muslim men to go to the mosque for noon prayers on Friday ran up against lockdown restrictions, despite the reassurance of imams and Islamic scholars that these were exceptional circumstances.In Israel, the UK and the US, ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities celebrated Purim on 9 and 10 March. People gathered in large numbersbut within days, rabbis and communal leaders were advising synagogues and yeshivas (religious schools) to close. After the Israeli government’s lockdown regulations were flouted, the entire city of Bnei Brak was barricaded, with 1,000 police officers blocking the movement of its ultra-Orthodox residents. And In New York, police broke up three ultra-Orthodox funerals last weekend.In the US, churches in Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Louisiana have continued to hold services, with some states offering limited exemptions from restrictions for faith organisations. Rodney Howard-Browne, a pastor in Tampa was arrested after his megachurch hosted acts of worship attended by hundreds of people. Amid these tensions, faith leaders in the UK say they have been taken aback by the numbers of people tuning into online worship and prayer – far more than turn up in person. Virtual services are “meeting a deep spiritual need”, said Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Ripon. “People are asking big questions about Covid-19 – why now, why us, what does this mean for my life?”This month, as the world’s major religions celebrate significant festivals – Easter, Passover, Ramadan and Vaisakhi – in isolation, the test of faith is set to intensify."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbd1be7636cc82125518472fbcd27e7e177373b/261_2_1659_995/master/1659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b410b29280413b96afd735a80fef159","title":"five months on what scientists now know about the coronavirus","story":"Medical researchers have been studying everything we know about Covid-19.

In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed more than 100,000 lives.

Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. Vaccines projects proliferate, antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly originated in bats, which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats’ immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.“This virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,” says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. “And so if that wildlife animal has a virus it’s picked up from a bat and we’re interacting with it, there’s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.”As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors – known as Ace-2 receptors – on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) “This virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,” says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell’s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body’s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.“A Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus’s success,” adds Ball. “Many people don’t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.”By contrast, Sars – which is also caused by a coronavirus – makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others – by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.Even worse, in some cases, a person’s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a cytokine storm. (In Greek, “cyto” means cell and “kino” means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These antibodies are made by the immune system, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.“It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. “And the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections – but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.”Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” says Skinner. “That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. “We have got to consider this pandemic from the virus’s position,” he says. “It is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.”In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.On Friday, the journal Nature reported that 78 vaccine projects had been launched round the globe – with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.This remarkable response raises hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”• This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned last week that the government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many iniduals flouted its rules on social distancing.Professor Stephen Reicher of St Andrews University, a specialist in crowd psychology, said: “Perhaps the government could start by asking the question: ‘How do we help people to comply?’ Rather than starting from a punitive perspective, you start from a facilitative perspective.“If you start from a presumption of goodwill towards people – how do we help? – then one obvious answer is by increasing the amount of space they can go to.”With the link between access to outdoor space and benefits to mental health well established, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that the mental health of the poorest, typically those living in overcrowded flats with no outdoor space, was most likely to be affected by the lockdown.In addition to requisitioning swaths of private land, Michie also urged the government to seize empty hotels and office blocks and convert them into safe spaces for victims of abuse and domestic violence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/651ae6da72bd4645a6f494c3697ae94311ea26cd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b8fbfff0c9adbdb8920a731485bcd3","title":"thousands lose last hope of having a baby as lockdown closes ivf clinics","story":"Women tell of ‘bereavement’ because they will be too old for fertility treatment when the coronavirus shutdown ends See all our coronavirus coverageThousands of couples may have missed their last chance of conceiving via IVF as fertility clinics shut their doors to patients on Wednesday. Some women who are only just young enough to be eligible for treatment will be too old in a few months’ time.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates Britain’s fertility industry, has ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients who are in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April. All new treatments have already been banned, a decision which is likely to prevent the births of at least 20,000 desperately wanted babies if it remains in place for 12 months.Some couples say they have had scans and treatments cancelled hours or even minutes before they were due to take place, and many fear their chance of conceiving will have disappeared completely by the time the lockdown ends.“You can’t rewind your biological clock,” said Dr Catherine Hill, of the reproductive research charity Progress Educational Trust. “Time is of the essence when it comes to fertility treatment. For some people, this shutdown means they may never become parents. This was going to be their last chance and they’re not able to have it. That is deeply distressing and traumatising.”The latest figures from the HFEA show that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. “If these numbers are similar for 2020 – and we expect them to have increased – this pandemic is silently affecting the lives of many more people than is immediately obvious,” said Gwenda Burns, chief executive of the charity Fertility Network UK.She said women in their late 30s and early 40s were feeling particularly anxious, fearing that clinicians may decide they are too old to continue their IVF treatment when the shutdown ends. NHS clinical commissioning groups do not generally allow women a second round of IVF after they hit 40, and stop offering any treatment at 42 private clinics typically refuse to treat women aged 45 or over.“It would be beneficial if the government could give assurances that patients will not be disadvantaged as a result of treatment being paused due to Covid-19,” said Burns.“For a lot of people, their hope of a family life has just been taken away,” said Christina Fraser, a relationship counsellor at Coupleworks. The infertile couples she is counselling are experiencing the same emotions people typically suffer when they are bereaved, she said. “For a lot of couples it’s a secret – they haven’t told people. So they’re grieving on their own. And they can’t even go round the corner to their mum for a hug.”Hearing others complain about how irritating it is to be around their children all day or joke about how there is going to be a baby boom in nine months’ time is often particularly painful for these couples, causing displaced resentment and triggering “dreadful rows” about insignificant grievances. “There’s nowhere for them to put all their anger and grief. And if people sit on those feelings and can’t express them, that can really lead to depression,” Fraser said.The Observer has been contacted by more than a dozen couples who were expecting to start treatment just as the shutdown began. One woman, whose husband can no longer produce sperm after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer, will turn 39 next month and was recently told her egg reserves have begun to decline. She fears that, by the time the shutdown ends, she will be unable to conceive. “Essentially, the situation with Covid-19 is my worst nightmare becoming a reality,” she said.Rose (not her real name), 41, and her husband sold their home to pay for private IVF treatment after struggling to conceive for three years. She spent the first three weeks of March injecting herself with hormones every day, before being told, just 45 minutes before she was due to attend a scan, that her entire treatment was cancelled. “I broke down. I’m aware that every day, at my age, my eggs diminish,” she said.She has been having terrible mood swings ever since and getting into “huge arguments over very small things” with her husband. “We’ve even had discussions where we’ve told each other to go and find someone else, someone younger or more fertile.” Although she is seeking counselling for her feelings of despair and depression, he doesn’t want to. “It’s absolutely awful.”Worst of all, she said, is the lack of recognition that infertile couples are suffering as a result of Covid-19. “You haven’t even got anything to show for your grief, if that makes sense. You haven’t got a grave to sit by. You just have to internalise it or it will drive you insane.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6729d22d27a4f5814b9b56dbd19d92f650fdb5b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9225e0dc448b368a39746ea23f8c88a0","title":"uk government giving incorrect information on self isolation say gps","story":"Doctors say some patients received letters wrongly saying they are in high-risk groupPeople across the UK are being given incorrect information from the government about whether or not to isolate, with some wrongly instructed to remain indoors for 12 weeks, GPs have warned.Doctors fear out-of-date information is being used as they are getting an increasing number of calls from people who do not understand why they have received a text or letter saying they are in the most at risk group. At the same time, some of those who are in priority groups are complaining they have been given no information, they said.The list of who to contact, which would normally take weeks to do, was compiled in 48 hours, and given the huge undertaking errors are likely to have crept in.Last month, the government announced it would contact 1.5 million people by 29 March to tell them that they should be “shielding”, which means they are most at risk to the virus and should stay indoors for 12 weeks.Dr Francesca Silman, a London GP, said: “Unfortunately a number of people I know did not receive letters despite fitting in the shielding category, some only received letters in the past few days, and others have received letters even though they don’t actually need to shield.”She added: “It is all a bit of a mess. Part of the problem was I think originally NHS England thought the GPs could do some of the searches – but this is not at all an easy task and the guidance for GPs to go ahead was retracted … Meanwhile, I think the public are unaware of this issue and likely to be following the letters they have or haven’t received unless they have been proactive themselves and looked up the guidance.”Information provided to the  from a GP in Teesside, north-east England, with a practice of 8,000 patients, found that of the 10 patients who had been recipients of an organ transplant, only six had received the letters and four had been missed. A significant number of other patients on chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, with blood cancers and other severe underlying health conditions had also been missed, they reported.The shielded patient list is a specific subset of patients identified by the chief medical officer. To identify these patients NHS Digital took the groups identified and converted them into a set of clinical codes and searched for patients with these conditions in the routine and administrative data sets that they hold nationally. They also did a search for patients this week and added around 400,000 more the original list of 900,000 patients, using data automatically pulled from GP systems.NHS Digital relies on the quality of data entry by thousands of NHS staff, and so there may be some errors in the data. The list was put together in 48 hours. Specialist doctors and GPs can also add to it.The Royal College of GPs said if anyone thinks they should be shielded but has not been told, or identified when they do not meet the criteria, they should contact their family doctor or hospital specialist. People have also started to receive texts from the government saying that if they feel the message does not apply to them they can opt out of receiving texts.Dr Hugh Reeve, a GP in Cumbria, said he had been fielding requests from people who were confused as to what they should be doing after receiving messages. “As a GP I am now totally confused as to who is getting these messages – those who self-identified and were told to shield and contact their GP or those who were identified by national trawl.”Katie Newbury, 32, from London, received a message in error. She had her spleen removed eight years ago, which puts at her risk of bacterial infections. She said she believed she was on the high risk list but not the shielding list. However, despite this she got a text from the government telling her she should stay in for 12 weeks.“I got a text and it was disconcerting as I have been going out of the house. I have been avoiding shops but I have been going for walks – just the thought of not being able to leave my house for 12 weeks is worrying.”She said she called her GP to confirm whether the advice was accurate and they said she could still go out for walks. “It did make me worry as I was wondering if there was something more they had discovered about people without spleens than initially.”“The doctor said they would check the guidance while on the phone and said it was all right and I could still go outside the house. I saw other people on social media had similar issues.”The Royal College of GPs also said that the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded is still unclear, and they are raising this issue with the governments and health leaders across the UK.Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “There is still some uncertainty over the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded, and we are raising this with the governments and health leaders across the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f51afe3fc58ff6fb161ad60419b16845457030/0_290_6095_3656/master/6095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f74c49ffe033221811530d470cb39","title":"a chance to do something meaningful the refugee chefs feeding health workers","story":"Despite facing personal hardship, a team of refugees has been delivering food to hospital staff in Malaysia’s capital during the coronavirus outbreakIn a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012.“We have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,” his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says.Cooking is what Mohammad Jaber does. For almost 30 years before war broke out in Syria, he ran a restaurant in Damascus. Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur’s Taman Melati neighbourhood.Now though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded.Three weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen.The response was immediate and overwhelming. “Just on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,” says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan.“In the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.” They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March.The first time he took part, Jaber – who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask – made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple.“My father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,” Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen.The refugee chefs – 12 women and three men – start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University’s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.Like Mohammad, Al-Akraa arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Syria in 2012, with his parents and four siblings. When he was 14, while trying to help his family, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities for working at a restaurant without a permit. Although the Malaysian government works with NGOs to provide some assistance for refugees, it does not recognise them legally, meaning they have limited opportunities to study and work.In detention for nine days, Al-Akraa met three Rohingya refugees who inspired him to start helping others when he was free. “I told myself I shouldn’t be complaining. At least I have a UNHCR refugee card, so I would be released, but they came by boat and didn’t have any documentation.”At the refugee kitchen, the chefs rotate every day, and next on the rota is 43-year-old Elham Jaber Jasim Musawi. She prepares chicken macaroni – which she often cooks for her kids – with the help of her husband, Hussam Kadhim Younes Al Mohammedawi. Her 14-year-old son, Danial Husam Kadhim, had helped her with the shopping the day before.Musawi left Baghdad with her husband and children in 2014 when Islamic State escalated its attacks in her country. Now they live in a three-bedroom flat in Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang neighbourhood. Lockdown has been hard for the family. The children watch TV and play football indoors to pass the time and Musawi is worried that the family won’t be able to pay their rent. Both her job at a local school and that of her husband have been affected by the restrictions on movement.Still, she is happy to help. “This is an opportunity I wouldn’t have passed up for anything. It’s not always that we get a chance to do something meaningful. We are all thankful to the doctors and all other medical workers who sacrifice their lives to keep us safe,” she says.The food is gratefully received by the nurses and doctors.“Even though they’re not from our country, they want to help us while we carry out our work,” says Shuhaida Shuib, 42, a nurse at Ampang hospital. “I think that’s very compassionate and it means a lot in these difficult times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59d46ca2fac3ef6d72a5741df98df461d3c6be7b/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e60c1ad65b240fd54c5c2369794de","title":"australian researchers a few weeks from clinical trial results for coronavirus treatment","story":"Early detection and finding drugs to reduce Covid-19’s deadliness a priority as experts say vaccine could be years away• Follow the latest Australia coronavirus news• Sign up for  Australia’s daily coronavirus email• Download the free  app to get the most important news notificationsAustralian researchers are “a few weeks” from concluding clinical trials of drugs to reduce the deadliness of the coronavirus by early diagnosis and treatment.The projects underline the strong medical opinion that a Covid-19 vaccine is several months or even years away.While vaccine research continues, greater emphasis now is on boosting detection and treatment in the quest to save lives.In addition there will be trials to evaluate the validity of so-called herd immunity in which iniduals’ resistance to the virus is spread.“I am actually quite optimistic we will have results at least – whether the results are good or not so good – from many clinical trials in the next few weeks,” said Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.Lewin also is research leader for combined university efforts under the banner of the Australian Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness for Infectious Diseases (APPPID).“The timeline for antiviral drugs and knowing whether they work or not is much shorter than for vaccines,” Lewin told reporters in Melbourne on Monday.“Because these studies are using existing drugs, so we know their safety, we know how to use them. We just don’t know if they lead to clinical benefit.”The researchers are hoping to find procedures for early detection of Covid-19, particularly in aged care homes which house those most vulnerable to the infections.The health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Monday the federal government would provide $3m for research into treatments and diagnosis.Sydney University would get $1m of that for a lead project into the use of CT scanning to help diagnose patients who might otherwise have to go to intensive care units of hospitals.“This will allow for early treatment, better treatment, better recovery and better outcomes,” Hunt said. The remaining $2m would go towards projects headed by the Doherty Institute to produce early, rapid diagnosis of infections in age care accommodation.The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said early diagnosis of those most at risk would allow for earlier and better treatment and recovery.Murphy said the health system was “pretty close” to allowing a wind down of strict measures such as self-isolation and business closures. But he warned any relaxing of restrictions was “particularly risky” and he could not predict when that might happen.Murphy said the decision would have to be made by government leaders who had to be “absolutely confident that we have the best possible public health system that can detect, isolate and contact trace every new case”.“And that’s we have a testing regime that is one of the best in the world,” Murphy said.“We are pretty close to that.” Lewin said about 300 trials of treatments were under way globally.“There are a few good leads from small studies, originally from China. And now from the US and Europe,” she said.“But actually none of them have yet been evaluated in what we call a randomised trial comparing the treatment to standard care with a clinical outcome in a large number of people.“So we are really waiting for these results. Some will come out of China in the next few weeks.”And she addressed the controversial issue of herd immunity.“Many of you have heard of the concept of herd immunity, of people becoming immune to the virus without ever getting sick,” she said.“Well we still have no idea how commonly that occurs. To do that we need a blood test for coronavirus, which we now have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55cbcde2155548a6b235fdfbeda10cf0633f1757/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450a1d91a6928560db618598db74ee13","title":"china infections rise as some spanish companies prepare to restart work","story":"Largely imported new Chinese cases prompts Wuhan-style restrictions near border with Russia China has seen a rise in Covid-19 cases along its northern border with Russia, as some Spanish factories and construction sites are preparing to resume work amid other continuing restrictions.On Sunday China’s national health commission reported 108 new infections, the highest number in more than five weeks, surpassing Saturday’s 99, which was nearly double the 46 reported on Friday.All but 10 of the cases were imported, and seven of the local infections were in the Heilongjiang province, a northern region where authorities are increasing restrictions and monitoring after a rise in people with Covid-19 crossing the Russian border.Heilongjiang’s capital, Harbin, as well as the border city of Suifenhe – which is under some Wuhan-style restrictions - now require all arrivals to quarantine for 28 days and undergo testing. Under the new restrictions, residential units in Harbin – where people have been confirmed to have the virus, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic – are to be locked down for 14 days.Suifenhe was one of the few routes for people to return to China from Russia after Russia stopped all flights and closed its land border to incoming traffic in late January and early February.Hubei province, where the outbreak began, again recorded no new cases, but two deaths in Wuhan.In Europe, Italy and France reported a drop in deaths in the past 24 hours – with Italy, the European nation most afflicted by the disease, reporting its lowest toll in more than three weeks.Some Spanish companies will resume operations on Monday, at the end of a two-weeks halt to all non-essential activity. The country’s death toll has fallen over recent days, but as a small bump in deaths was reported on Sunday, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, warned that the locked-down country was “far from victory”.“We are all keen to go back out on the streets ... but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse,” he said. “General confinement will remain the rule for the next two weeks and the only people allowed out will be those going to authorised jobs or making authorised purchases.”The move to allow some business to resume has drawn criticism from some sectors, which fear infections will rise again. Those returning to work have been advised to maintain social distancing, and face masks will be handed out in metro and rail stations.“I want to be very clear: we are not entering a phase of de-escalation,” Sánchez said. “The state of emergency is still in force and so is the lockdown. The only thing that has come to an end is the two-week extreme economic hibernation period.”Italy is expected to let more businesses begin operating on Tuesday. In the US, Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday night to angrily deny accusations that he rebuffed advice to implement physical distancing measures as far back as February, describing the New York Times, which printed the allegations, as a “fake” paper.Trump’s top medical adviser on the pandemic, Anthony Fauci, appeared to confirm the allegations, which said he and other administration officials recommended physical distancing measures in February but were rebuffed for almost a month.Fauci told CNN that “there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then”.In the same CNN interview, Fauci said any gradual economic re-start in the US would be dependent on rapid and widespread testing. “Once the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to think about a gradual re-entry of some sort of normality, some rolling re-entry.”Fauci believed this could happen in some places by May, but cautioned that easing restrictions would result in more infections. “I mean, that is just reality.”He said he believed that if there was a “good, measured way of rolling into the steps towards normality”, then people would hopefully be able to vote in the 3 November election “the standard way”.Current social distancing measures in the US are due to expire on 30 April.The global number of confirmed cases has passed 1.85 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been more than 114,000 deaths globally, including 19,899 in Italy, where the fatality rate has started to slow.In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384f9fe9f17cdd5cd74d5eb10d4b0b858d758849/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d48e6d6cb7fffd6d84b6feab82a5d597","title":"irans president has left nation open to second covid 19 wave critics","story":"Hassan Rouhani has eased social distancing rules and businesses are reopeningIran’s president has been accused of leaving the country exposed to a second coronavirus outbreak after he relaxed social distancing rules in the face of concerns that as many as 7 million Iranians had been left jobless or suffering wage cuts because of the restrictions imposed by the government over the last month.Hassan Rouhani has urged millions of low-risk businesses to reopen and lifted travel restrictions within provinces. Most businesses in Tehran are not due to reopen formally until 18 April, but travel has already intensified, leading to a build-up of traffic.Surveys cited by the government showed that a third of people are experiencing financial problems.Ali Rabiei, Rouhani’s spokesman, told the Isna news agency that the Covid-19 crisis had affected 3.3 million official employees through dismissal, suspension or reduction of wages, with a further 4 million self-employed also feeling its impact. In common with most world leaders, Rouhani is wrestling with the competing needs of collapsing living standards and public health. Iranian officials describe it as a dual policy of “saving lives and providing bread”.He is also operating against a backdrop of US economic sanctions and public scepticism about official government statistics on the spread of coronavirus. Schools, religious services, mass gatherings and many shops remain closed and Rouhani has said if the position did not improve he expected the existing closures to remain in place through Ramadan.He urged people to use private cars after there were crowded buses on the first day of the relaxed rules on Saturday. The metro has called for “smart distancing”, although what this means in practice is not clear.Iran’s medical system organisation expressed concern, saying smart distancing “was being introduced without considering the scientific and executive justifications for the project, or the threat that the past efforts of all people, officials and medical staff will be wasted”.The Tehran city council chairman, warned the reopening of business might lead to “a second wave of coronavirus”.Ali Maher, the planning deputy of the Tehran coronavirus taskforce, said the Rouhani government has been shifting between two different approaches against the spread of the virus, one of mass immunity and the other of implementing lockdowns and quarantines.Newspapers have also been dealt a heavy blow, with the government proposing to ban all but online newspapers temporarily on the basis paper might transmit infection. The plan, subsequently withdrawn, led to warnings of mass permanent newspaper closures. Redundancies, including in prestigious reformist newspapers such as Etemad, have gone ahead.Tragedies, including the death of three generations of men in one family, are being publicised in a bid to underline the seriousness of the crisis. A mother and son were reported to have committed suicide after the father died.There are also growing reports of domestic violence, with one Tehran counselling service saying it had taken 4,000 calls in the last few days. Children stuck at home without education do not have the money to afford the internet required to download lessons.The health ministry’s latest statistics on Sunday showed a continued de-escalation of coronavirus cases, with 4,474 now dead and 71,686 infected. The government is pointing to successive falls in the daily numbers of those dying and infected.Figures on Sunday showed 117 had died in the previous 24 hours. The number of newly infected was 1,657, down from 2,875 11 days ago. The figures have prompted Rouhani to boast Iran has responded better to the crisis than Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591b7e078ffb9a6b5600964a2b321bf2485d91dd/0_148_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a426c5c5c819c2cd8321c89114ae402","title":"pop up bike lanes help with coronavirus social distancing in germany","story":"Road markings redrawn after cyclists demand more space to comply with Covid-19 rulesGerman cities are redrawing road markings to create “pop-up” cycle lanes for the duration of the Covid-19 lockdown, as cyclists demand more space to physically distance on their commutes to work.Local authorities in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin trialled a temporary widening of two cycle lanes on 27 March, arguing it would help cyclists keep the required 1.5-metre distance apart while car traffic was down owing to Germany’s coronavirus restrictions.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.On Friday, the council declared the pilot scheme a success because it had improved cycling safety while not hindering traffic. An expansion of the scheme on further roads in Kreuzberg, as well as in the Schöneberg and Tempelhof districts, is planned for the coming weeks.The council said it had used removable tape and mobile signs to mark out the expanded lanes, which can be removed when the current restrictions on movement are lifted.Residents in 133 other German cities have formally submitted applications for similar pop-up bike lanes to their local authorities on the back of a campaign by Environmental Action Germany (DUH), an environmental NGO.The campaign group cites new research linking air pollution to higher coronavirus death rates as an argument for redrawing infrastructure across the country.“The coronavirus is showing us that clean air is an indispensable asset,” said DUH’s chair, Jürgen Resch. “It is now especially important to temporarily make it more important for people to move safely on their bikes. This will help improve air quality, enables exercise in fresh air while keeping a safe distance and avoids unnecessary accidents.”Proponents of the scheme cite the Colombian capital, Bogotá, as the example to emulate, where the mayor, Claudia López, opened up nearly 72 miles (117km) of new bike routes in mid-March in the hope of reducing congestion and person-to-person contact.In Berlin, opposition politicians from the pro-business Free Democratic party have described the pop-up cycle lane plans as an “unnecessary provocation” by the bike lobby, saying they will have little practical use.German states have encouraged the use of bicycles in spite of the current restrictions, under which gatherings of more than two people are banned, with exceptions for families.“The use of a bicycle allows citizens to meet the requirements for minimising contact,” a spokesperson for the transport ministry in Thuringia told the German news agency dpa.In Germany, bike repair shops are currently exempt from state-ordered closures because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Three federal states, Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, have also allowed bike vendors to stay open."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

It was then that she had an idea about organising a community clap for NHS workers after seeing something similar in her home country of the Netherlands. Now, every Thursday at 8pm, millions of people head out into the streets to clap and cheer for the people risking their lives on the frontline. She tells Anushka Asthana how one idea became a national outpouring.  The crisis is bringing people together in other ways too. Naveed Khan is using a customised vehicle to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable people across his home city of Bradford. Lucy Welling, an NHS nurse, had her bike stolen as Britain went into lockdown. But followers on social media rallied round and helped find the bike amid several offers of a new one. The episode inspired a new movement, #TourDeThanks, to offer up bikes to key workers. In Nunhead, south London, Claire Sheppard set up Nunhead Knocks to help out those living in isolation.

There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources.

You may have forgotten it – what with all the days morphing into each other – but today is actually a bank holiday. And with that in mind we thought we’d ignore the coughing elephant in the room for one day only and answer some of the questions that have been keeping us – and other people – up at night for donkey’s years.We had some troubling queries of our own that we felt needed to be urgently addressed and took to Twitter in search of similarly pressing questions that people felt they needed answered. Then we threw everything into the pot and this is what came out.Yesterday was Easter Sunday – a day marked, this year as ever, with the gorging of chocolate. But why do we celebrate what many believe was a crucifixion followed by a resurrection with the eating of egg-shaped chocolate?Back in the day, Christian churches frowned on those who ate eggs – normal eggs – during Holy Week, the seven days between Palm Sunday and yesterday. No, we don’t know why they did that, either. As a result, strict observers of the rules did not eat any of the eggs their chickens laid. They set them aside. Then, rather than seeing them go to waste, some people started decorating them to give to children as gifts on the big day. The Victorians made this tradition their own but rather than using real eggs, they fashioned them out of cardboard, covered them with fancy cloth and filled them with gifts. The Germans added chocolate to the mix and so a tradition was born.Why do we have an Easter bunny? Wouldn’t an Easter chicken make more sense? When you’re talking about a rabbit sneaking about the place with a bag full of chocolate eggs to hide, sense doesn’t really come into it, now does it? The Easter bunny is top dog in this part of the world but it’s s a fox in Germany and a cuckoo in Switzerland.Speaking of eggs, should the regular ones go in the fridge?Well that depends on where in the world you are. In the United States and Japan, the food safety authorities insist that all eggs are cleaned before making their way to shops. They do this to reduce the spread of salmonella from the gunk sometimes found on shells. In the European Union, on the other hand, regulations forbid egg washing over fears that washing an egg damages its protective cuticle which stops bad bacteria entering the egg. So in this country your eggs don’t need to go in the fridge. Most people still put them there, mind you – because they have to go somewhere and don’t fridges come with an egg holder? If you do chill your eggs you are supposed to bring them to room temperature before cooking, so they don’t end up runnier than you like them. Like anyone has time for that.What about tomatoes? Should they be kept in the fridge?Absolutely not. Tomatoes are sensitive to low temperatures and your fridge will reduce the activity of their enzyme-producing genes and degrade their flavour. So store them at room temperature and eat them before they start to rot. Pricewatch adopted this approach a while back and the fruit flies went mad for the tomatoes so back in the fridge they went.Why are eggs so hard to find in my supermarket?Because retailers keep moving them around like some class of corporate Easter bunny. They know eggs are a staple which people often come into the shop to buy. And they don’t require a fridge like dairy products or a huge amount of dedicated space like bread. So if the eggs get moved about sporadically throughout the year shoppers have to wander the aisles on occasion looking for the damn things. While on their wanders, they are led to parts of the store they might otherwise ignore and by doing that they might buy things they had not intended to buy.Speaking of supermarkets, why is the booze always on the last aisle of a supermarket?This is another example of retailers playing with us. They put all the healthy and colourful things – fruit, vegetables, flowers and the like – at the start of your shopping journey and the treats and booze at the end. By the time we have made our way around the shop and arrive at the booze aisle we are pleased with all the healthy stuff so happily add some not-so-healthy stuff. If the booze was in the first aisle we visited, then for a spell, our trollies would just have wine, beer or spirits in them and that might make us feel bad – and less inclined to buy as much of the stuff.What is that whirring sound an ATM makes?It is nothing sound. It is certainly not the machine counting out your notes. The great god of the internet has told us that the noise is produced by a speaker so users will be assured their money is on the way and in the absence of the noise, the machine would be silent.If a steak has a use -by date of today and I cook it, can I eat it tomorrow?Yes, cooking a product that is just about to pass its use-by date typically extends its edible life by two or three days.How do they work out the best-before and use-by dates anyway?Manufacturers rely on a heady cocktail of maths, experience, testing and guessing. Equations are sometimes used to work out when food will turn using a predicted rate of bacteria growth. Another approach is to rely on past experience with a particular products. Testing is sometime done to establish a shelf life. A product gets put through whatever conditions it may experience in the retail chain to see what impact light and temperature and movement have on it. The product is tested repeatedly and when it goes bad, it will have a certain date. The maker will then take off a few days off to give it a safety net and that is the use-by or best-before date. And then sometimes, with a product in an airtight can, for example, they just pick a random date in the future run with it.Where does the lovely new car smell come from?Is it really that lovely though? What you are smelling in a new car is vinyl and plastic and glue minus the human odours we add to the mix. The smell is made of more than 50 volatile organic compounds. The compounds break down at a rate of about 20 per cent per week, so after a month they will have all but disappeared. The new car smell might disappear for good in the years ahead as carmakers are busy working out ways to make cars without all the sealants and solvents that give new cars their unique odour.Why are things often priced in amounts ending in 99?It is probably not what you think. Or at least it wasn’t at the start. Most people think such a pricing system is done to fool us into thinking things are cheaper than they are. In the 19th century mechanical registers could not issue receipts or do internal tallies. So they only way a store owner could know a sale was happening if he was elsewhere in the shop was through the sound of the cash register opening. When everything was priced at numbers ending in nine, cashiers had to open the tills to give a penny in change, so every sale was audible.And speaking of 99s, why is a 99 called a 99? Thank the Italians. And Cadbury. When Italy had monarchs, the king was always assigned an elite guard made up of 99 soldiers and, as a result, the fanciest of things became known as 99s. Fast forward to the 1930s, when Cadbury launched a little Flake specially for ice-cream cones. The ice-cream business was dominated by expat Italians and, to appeal to those key buyers, Cadbury’s called their innovation a 99.Why isn’t a size 12 or 14 the same in all shops?Women’s clothes sizes are mostly meaningless. Sizes became a thing only in the 1920s with the rollout of mass-production techniques. In the 1930s, the authorities in the United States set out to create a standard system. Then war intervened so it took almost 20 years for a commercial standard to be arrived at. It combined figures for bust, height and hip. The system was almost immediately out of date, as body shapes had changed a lot between 1939 and the 1960s. They have continued to change in the US and here. To add to the confusion, sizes in the US, Ireland, the rest of Europe and elsewhere are all different, so a US size six can be an Irish eight, a French 36 or a Japanese nine.How long does a bottle of wine last after opening?While we are tempted to say as long as it takes to drink it there is a better answer. If you put the cork back in a bottle of unfinished wine and stick it in the fridge – red included – you limit the wine’s exposure to oxygen, heat and light so it should last from two to five days, with wines with more tannin lasting longer. If you forget to recork and refrigerate it, it might be gone before you wake up on the morning after the night before.Are generic painkillers as good as branded ones?Yes. The only difference between an expensive, branded painkiller and a very cheap generic one is the price, because both are made with the same active ingredients and have to pass the same stringent tests set by the authorities.Obviously but that does not mean a scoop of buttery mash constitutes one of your five a day – or five scoops five of your five a day. Despite being entirely natural and full of vitamins and minerals, potatoes are a starchy food. So nutritionists cross them off the good-vegetable list and lump them in with pasta and rice, as a carbohydrate.What is the difference between red and white cheddar?Dye. Red cheddar and white cheddar are the same cheese but the red one has colouring added. And why would anyone bother dying cheese? Makers of Cheshire cheese used to make cheap and premium products, with the former identifiable by red food colouring. Then they started doing something similar in Leicester. People seemed to like red cheese, so the cheddar makers got on board.Why would anyone buy a hot-cross bun for a penny when you can get two for the same price? This came from a reader called Terry Treanor. It is a great question. But there is an answer. You should only buy as many hot-cross buns as you and your daughters and your son need. Do not be stockpiling the hot-cross buns. Even if one or two cost the same price.Is there any difference in quality between wine bottles with a screw top and cork? We found ourselves on winesdirect.ie when we went in search of an answer to this question. “There is a misnomer that the wine underneath a screw cap must be inferior” that site says. It suggests that this is “a misguided belief originally fuelled by Old World wine countries fearing the threat of up-and-coming wine nations such as Australia and the USA who began using screw caps instead of corks . . . We believe the important point in this prickly dispute is that screw caps are proving every bit as good as, if not better than, corks for sealing wine. In short, don’t judge a wine by its seal.”How do they get the figs into the fig rolls?We have no idea and no-one at Jacobs has ever revealed the secret. We can tell you that the company was set up in Waterford in 1851 by two Quaker brothers, William and Robert Jacob, and moved to Dublin’s Bishop Street – a site which was occupied by rebels in the Easter Rising. It merged with Boland’s – another biscuit site occupied by rebels in the 1916 Rising – in the 1970s and then everything was transferred to Tallaght. Rosie Hackett – of the bridge fame – was a union organiser at Jacobs and was sacked by the company for her role in the 1913 lockout. If she knew how the company got the figs into the fig rolls she never told anyone either.Who ended up taking the horse to France?They sent the young lad over on the ferry on his own. He never came back.How does the label on Imperial Leather stay on the soap until the end of the bar?Who among us has not wondered this? The soap gets smaller but the label stays the same size and it stays on the soap defying all the laws of physics (or, you know, none of them). Turns out that the sticker is not there just as a decoration but is on the soap to make it last longer and not get mushy. The Imperial Leather people have been asked this before. “When the soap is used, the sticker will make and keep the top surface, where the sticker is on, concave. After use, the soap is supposed to be upside down. The concave surface will help water run out from the bar and minimise the touching surface on a soap tray.”Can I recycle wine corks?Chances are a many Irish households will have found themselves generating a good deal more cork-related waste in recent days. The good news that wine corks can be recycled. It is both natural and biodegradable material and can become all sorts of things including cork boards, coasters and flooring. The bad news is that recycle centres in Ireland don’t commonly have the capacity for recycling them. They can, however, go in your brown bin and are suitable for composting.My nearest cafe offers a bacon-and egg-sandwich priced at €9.90. Would this be a likely candidate for Ireland’s most expensive bacon-and-egg sandwich?Well we can’t say for sure but we thought we might break down the price. You can buy six rashers for about €1.80 retail, which is 30 cent a slice. Let’s assume the wholesale prices is €1.20 (it’s probably a good bit cheaper, to be honest). If four slices go into a sandwich, the cost to the cafe is 80 cent. You can buy 12 free-range eggs in a big supermarket for €2.99.

Video: RTÉThe State’s coronavirus testing backlog has been reduced from a high point of around 35,000 people waiting for results to some 11,000, Health Service Executive (HSE) chief executive Paul Reid has said.He said 25 laboratories were now being used to examine Covid-19 tests, including 20 in hospitals, the national lab in UCD, a Department of Agriculture facility, and centre in Germany, which has assisted in reducing the results backlog. Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin on Monday, Mr Reid said nearly 9,000 tests were completed on Saturday. “We did build up a significant backlog…That backlog will continue to be reduced and will be reduced completely by the end of this week,” he said. Mr Reid said some 72,000 tests had been completed in the State to date, and that this has doubled “in a very short time”. The average daily number of tests being completed was 2,800, but the system hit a “peak” of 8,900 on Saturday, he said. There are now 9,655 confirmed coronavirus cases in the State, and 334 people have died as a result of being infected with Covid-19. EssentialIncreased testing capability is seen as essential to Government plans to limit the spread of coronavirus to such an extent that it can consider easing restrictions on personal movement, which are in place until May 5th at least. Senior Government figures stress that while they do not want to extend the restrictions further, they will do so if it is deemed necessary. It is hoped the current lockdown slows the virus to such an extent that will allow “space” for some restrictions to be eased – such as some pupils being allowed attend school on a limited basis – without risking a substantial rise in infections if this happens, stricter measures will be reintroduced. “Very preliminary work” is being carried out by health officials on how to “ease the restrictions”, according to a senior Government source, but the rate of reproduction of the virus must drop in the coming weeks before the limitations on economic and social life will be relaxed. It is stressed that the period after the lockdown will see tests turned around more quickly, with the criteria for having a test broadening from those showing two symptoms of the virus to just one. Growth rateTo consider lifting restrictions, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the growth rate of the virus, which is now just below 10 per cent, needs to fall below 5 per cent and that the average number of people in intensive care units being treated for the virus needs to drop to near 100 from its current level of about 150.Mr Harris also said the reproductive rate of virus – the rate which measures how many people each infected person is likely to pass the virus on to – is now “in and around” one.“If that is just above one, the virus continues to grow if it is slightly below one, the virus is beginning to be suppressed,” he said.A reproductive rate of 0.6 or 0.7 is said to offer the “space” to ease some restrictions and monitor the effect of such a move while allowing stricter measures to be brought in again if needed without risking a dramatic spike in new infections.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Increased testing capacity will be key to any decision to reduce economic and social restrictionsPSNI said reports received of street incident on Saturday involving group of men with weaponsCork-based Sanctuary Mask Initiative providing protective gear to DP centres and nursing homesHouse parties broken up by police while parents drop children to play with friendsMan found dead on street after report of altercation in Ballynahone Close areaRolling out effective test would give greater certainty about measures to end lockdownPCR ascertains whether the virus is present antibody tests tell you if you have beaten itHuman rights body issues letter to party leaders ahead of government formation talksFor the first time in its 190-year history, the abbey of Mount Melleray is closed to visitorsPoll of 100,000 people reveals high level of understanding of Covid-19 restrictionsMasks, gowns, gloves and goggles from China pose challenges, HSE expert saysApproach to large gatherings, travel and work will all change, says Dr Ailis O\u0026rsquoCarrollInitial changes could include limited openings of schools, DIY stores and garden centresCork University Hospital model remotely identifies those with a rising temperatureCillian Wolfe went before court accused of violent disorder and intimidating a witnessInfrastructural spending vital to quash idea austerity back in Covid-19 wake, says Fine GaelTommy Bowe, Rory Best and others send messages of support to staff at National Maternity HospitalThe cargo shipment will containe 70 tonnes of personal protective equipment for healthcare workersGarda\u0026iacute allege accused forcibly removed 17-year-old from vehicle and taking car keysTwenty-five deaths in Northern Ireland from Covid-19 over Easter weekendStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227309.1586707095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus garda%C3%AD send home bank holiday weekend sun seekers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Gardaí on patrol at Seapoint Park in  Dublin on Saturday. Photograph Nick BradshawThe .Sunbathers could be seen dotting coastal parks from Sandymount to Sandycove but many did not get the chance to develop much of a tan as gardaí were swiftly in to move people on.“People are allowed to take brief exercise, but sunbathing is not exercise,” a garda who was approaching people sitting beside Sandymount Strand said.“They are mostly people in ones and twos, no big groups and mostly they weren’t aware that the 2km, is to be used only for exercise.”Motorists along the coastal road were also turned back at Garda checkpoints for not adhering to the Covid-19 movement restrictions.“There are people who don’t realise they’re breaking the rules, but there are others who are just chancing their arm,” a garda who was stopping motorists and cyclists on the Rock Road just outside Blackrock said.“We’re asking them where they live, the purpose of their journey. I’ve had quite a few people say they’re just out for a spin – that doesn’t count as an essential journey.”CheckpointAt another checkpoint close to the East Pier in Dún Laoghaire, a garda said people were being “very compliant” when asked to turn around.“We’ve also been telling people that the Forty Foot is closed. There had been people getting through earlier in the day, but the council have since put up more secure barriers.”One garda on a bicycle, who was asking sunbathers to leave Sandycove Park, said he had earlier stopped a cyclist who had come all the way from Finglas.“Even if people are coming from Blackrock, I’m telling them they are beyond their 2km limit so they need to turn around and go home. I’ve also had to tell people you can’t drive here and then do your 2km exercise, the restriction is to within 2km of your front door,” he said.“Mostly I’m telling people here that they can’t be lounging around, or having picnics, but if it wasn’t for the sun today, this wouldn’t be happening at all.”Elsewhere, the Phoenix Park was quieter than it had been on previous weekends during the period of movement restrictions, despite the warm weather. This was largely down to gardaí and park rangers making a concerted effort to move people on.‘We get it’One senior garda managed to clear around 40 sunbathers, mostly couples, from the grass surrounding the Wellington Monument in less than 10 minutes.“We just sat down after doing a bit of exercise,” said one of a couple asked to move said, “but no, we get it, people are getting a bit too relaxed about it, so I understand why we were asked to get up, it has to be done.”A group of three women in their 20s, who share an apartment, had just realised they could not sunbath in the park together.“We thought it was ok because we all live together, and we’re not close to anyone else here,” one said.The garda clearing the park said he has had some people question why they could not lay down on the grass.“It takes most people about 20 minutes to walk 2km, so I’ve been telling people they really shouldn’t be out of their homes for more than 40 minutes, and they can’t just lie around here all day,” he said.“Most were fine, some asked why they couldn’t have a picnic, and why they should go home. The answer is, to save lives.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227450.1586728505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monks in the age of coronavirus it goes against our ethos to be closed up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dom Richard Purcell, Abbot of Mount Melleray Abbey in Co Waterford. Photograph: Patrick BrowneThe Some 1,500 years ago, Benedict of Nursia encouraged followers to welcome all guests appearing on their doorstep. Known as the Rule of St Benedict, it is an edict followed closely by the Cistercian Trappist monks of Mount Melleray.Today, however, the rule stands in conflict with the Government’s instructions for all strangers to stay at home, says Dom Richard Purcell, the abbot of Mount Melleray near Cappoquin in Co Waterford.The abbey closed, in compliance. “It is severe. Normally speaking, we would welcome the stranger in whatever context, and monks should welcome everybody that comes to them as if they were Jesus,” he say. “We all recognise the need for the restrictions but it goes completely against our ethos and our nature to be closed up the way we are. Please God we’ll get to the other side of it in a few months. But it will pass.”Despite the coronavirus, Dom Richard and Melleray’s six other monks still carry on with the seven daily prayers from 4am to 8pm that have marked the abbey’s day since it was built in 1833 at the foot of the Knockmealdown Mountains. “We’re very lucky in that we have two things that a lot of people don’t have: routine and space,” Dom Richard says, pointing towards the rolling green fields belonging to the abbey.In the days prior to the tightening of the Government’s restrictions on movement late last month, Melleray saw a deluge of people arrive to its grounds, almost double its usual number for the time of year.“That last weekend the church was open, there was well over a thousand candles lit here in the course of the afternoon,” Dom Richard says. “They were looking for hope. They were people coming up to pray for family and friends who are sick because that’s the most frightening thing about it. The big thing is the unknown.The consequences of the coronavirus were brought home to Melleray last month with the death at the age of 96, of Fr Columban Heaney. The oldest Cistercian monk in Ireland, he had spent almost 70 years living a monastic life. In normal times, his funeral would have brought hundreds to Melleray: “He had family in Derry and in Scotland who couldn’t come, as well as older family members who would not be allowed to travel,” says Dom Richard. “It was extraordinary. We had the funeral with just the seven monks and five undertakers. The funeral was livestreamed so the family could see what was happening.” According to Facebook, over 7,000 people watched.Like other religious institutions, Melleray is live streaming its services, though the 44-year-old abbot, who was elected in 2017, admits it is “harder to gauge” the people’s mood as the days have passed. “We’re cut off,” he says. However, he sees live streaming of services as “an opportunity” to maintain connections. “The usual ways for meeting people are not there so we’ve had to find new ways to evangelise.”Before Covid-19, the people who came to Melleray ranged from traditional Catholics to the spiritual, or those who were “searching” for a connection with God. Asked if the legacy left by the crisis, and the breaking of old certainties will boost numbers afterwards, he is wary: “We’ll have to wait and see on that one.” He is optimistic for Melleray, though.The first order of business after the restrictions are lifted will be a requiem Mass for Fr Columban, one attended by his family, friends and neighbours.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227707.1586773432!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science the case for crushing covid 19 rather than living with it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  in the US, said people should not assume a change in the weather will limit the spread of the coronavirus. ‘You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,’ he said. Photograph: Al DragoThe New York Times.The need to crush it:The longer the pandemic maintains its grip, the more disagreement emerges on the best way to deal with it. Within the world of science, perhaps the most significant ergence is between the “flatten the curvists” and “Covid-19 crushers”. The latter group advocates short, sharp additional restrictions.There are two critical aspects to this. Firstly, any seasonal benefit – such as warm weather and high humidity (great for killing off flu) – may be cancelled by humanity’s vulnerability to the virus.“One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing,” declared Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, on ABC’s Good Morning America. Fauci is the man who causes Donald Trump’s teeth to grind whenever he gives his latest update.The second difficulty is the “flatten the curve goes on for years” in the absence of a vaccine. That is why we need to weigh up balances, especially in the context of beginning to ease restrictions.A key assumption of the flatten strategy is that around the same number of people will eventually be infected with Covid-19, but just over a longer time period. Many models predict this period, which could require intermittent lockdowns, might last for up to two years.Dr Harvey Fineberg, past president of the US National Academy of Medicine, is in no doubt a different path is needed.“The aim is not to flatten the curve. The goal is to crush the curve,” he wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.New Zealand is held up as the best pupil in the class. It has had just 1,049 confirmed cases and four deaths since February 28th. Just 14 people were in hospital with the virus as of Saturday, April 11th.RCSI infectious disease specialist Prof Sam McConkey has summarised in a tweet what that might entail, and interestingly noted it would have to be on all-Ireland basis if we were go that route:“In Ireland, should we follow New Zealand, eliminate SARSCoV2 from the island through 60 days of contact-tracing and self-isolating in \u0026lt3h, use GPS location data, 14-day quarantine for travellers, cloth reusable masks for all, phone app to show status, phased openings, all with NI.”Ireland v. UK:A big question is why the pandemic has played out in the State in a discernibly different way to the UK, and to some extent Northern Ireland.Yes, we moved quicker to physical distancing and restricting movement, while it’s almost as if there was a strange, three-week delay in hard but necessary messaging across the water, trying to catch up on the lack of urgency and clarity early on. But there is more to it than that.Researcher Lainey Doyle, who specialised in the history of medicine, made telling comparisons on twitter. It started out with health systems roughly on a par for instance the UK had 6.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people the Irish equivalent was 6.5.Then deviation becomes more evident. Ireland has performed 8.69 tests per 1,000 population the UK equivalent is four.Currently, UK death rates are more than double those in Ireland 14.8 deaths per 100,000 people compared to 6.5 here (More than 10,000 deaths in the UK compared to 334 deaths as of Sunday in the State).The UK hit 1,000 deaths in a single day, coinciding with 2,000 deaths a day in the US. Remarkably, it is accounting for 10 per cent of global deaths from Covid-19, while the US daily death record is in a country with five times the population of Britain.Global race update:The race against the common enemy continues with unprecedented intensity on three fronts: to produce a vaccine to generate antiviral treatments and to engineer a validated antibody test kit to show if a person has had Covid-19.A team in Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert is confident a vaccine against coronavirus could be ready by September with human trials due to begin in the next fortnight. It seems to have stolen a march on CureVac in Germany. who flagged trials would be ready to start in JuneJuly.Pfizer and BioNTech are laying plans for manufacturing their candidates for trials by late April. BioNTech and CureVac are reported to be hard at work trying to get regulators to rewrite the rules on human trials.Meanwhile, the first results from Gilead’s late-stage testing of remdesivir (normally used to treat Ebola) are expected this month. If results are positive, expect regulatory approvals to come quickly – again raising ethical issues around fast-tracking. It’s quite possible the drug could become the standard of care for Covid-19 at least for a while.The necessary urgency at a time of pandemic is tempered by those scientists who say “not so fast”, given in “normal times” proving a vaccine works safely can be painfully slow.But as the scale of the pandemic becomes clearer, a provocative, ethically complicated proposal to shave months off that timeline is gaining traction, which advocates giving people an experimental vaccine and then deliberately try to infect them.Rubella vaccine inventor Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania told Science magazine a carefully-designed “human challenge” trial could offer clear proof of a vaccine’s worth at blinding speed.“We’re talking two, three months,” said Plotkin, who has co-authored a proposal which describes how this might be ethically done (his took six years, by the way).But “people who are faced with a terrifying problem like this one will opt for measures that are unusual. And we have to constantly rethink our biases,” he added.The problem is Covid-19 is so new. It’s not clear how often the virus makes people seriously ill or leaves them with long-term complications. Where you’re going to give somebody a virus on purpose, you really want to understand the disease so that you know that what you’re doing is a reasonable risk.Grounds for optimism:– R0 moves in right direction: Much hinges on the R0 value of an infectious disease. If it’s three, a typical person who is infected will spread it to three people during the period they’re infectious. Ireland has brought its Covid-19 R0 down from six in early March to close to one – in the US, it’s currently at six. If we get it below one, the pandemic will begin to fizzle out. The national effort has shifted to the next task at hand bringing the R0 as close as possible to zero.– Wins that matter: Let it be known April 9th was the day we reached a big milestone. It was best encapsulated by Prof Liam Glynn of UL in a tweet:“We are no longer on an exponential growth curve and this have prevented many #Covid-19 cases and deaths...Comparing our rates to some other countries our early actions saved lives...”But he did not allow room for complacency, adding: “We need to do more.”– Irish optimism ratings: Pragmatic optimism is needed as people face into weeks more of lock in amid much uncertainty over what Ireland will emerge once restrictions are eased. More than 60 per cent of adults were optimistic in the most recent analysis by Core Research. This positive level of optimism “is being influenced by the solidarity of actions from all stakeholders in society”, it concludes. Another action that delivers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227682.1586773805!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus china reports highest number of cases in five weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man wearing a protective face mask stands next to a globe at the riverside park along the Yangtze River, in Wuhan, China. Photograph: Roman PilipeyEPAChina’s northeast Heilongjiang province which borders Russia has become the new battleground against the coronavirus as authorities reported the highest number of new daily cases in nearly six weeks, driven by infected travellers from overseas.China fears a rise in imported cases could spark a second wave of Covid-19 and push the country back into a state of near paralysis.A total of 108 new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from 99 a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since 143 infections were reported on March 5th.The National Health Commission said 98 of the new cases were imported, a new record. A total of 49 Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive.“Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place,” said a resident of the border city of Suifenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu.“Some Chinese citizens they want to come back, but it’s not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for?”Though the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March 12th because of the rise in imported cases.Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.The land route through the city had become one of few options available for Chinese nationals trying to get into China after Russia stopped all flights to the country.Suifenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating 28 days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests.Lifting restrictionsThe spread of coronavirus in Spain is continuing to slow down as it started tentative moves to ease its shutdown. Spain allowed workers in some non-essential industries to return to factories and construction sites on Monday.Some 517 new deaths were recorded overnight, while the number of infections logged was the lowest in more than three weeks, at nearly 3,500.The Spanish health ministry figures bring the overall death toll from the pandemic in the country to 17,489 and the total positive cases to 169,496.Heavy industry and construction workers returned to work on Monday after a two-week hiatus in economic activity, but the government is keeping most Spaniards under confinement for the fifth week in a row.Retail stores and services are still required to stay closed, and the government is strongly encouraging office workers to keep working from home.Some health experts and regional politicians argue that it is premature to ease any part of the lockdown order.Police in Madrid handed out face masks to the few commuters taking public transportation to work in the early hours of Monday.Meanwhile, South Korean officials have warned that hard-earned progress fighting the coronavirus pandemic could be hit by new infections at bars and leisure spots, highlighting global tensions between governments keen to maintain social distancing and citizens eager to resume their lives as economic pressure mounts.South Korea’s caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new cases a day, but officials have warned of a broader “quiet spread”, pointing to transmissions at locations such as bars that may indicate eased attitudes towards social distancing.South Korean prime minster Chung Sye-kyun said officials were discussing new public guidelines that would allow people to engage in “certain levels of economic and social activity” while also maintaining distance to slow the spread of the virus.Social distancing was still on full display for Easter Sunday celebrations around the globe, with many Christians marking the day isolated in their homes while clergy preached to empty pews.St Peter’s Square at the Vatican was barricaded to keep out crowds, while one Florida church drew a large turnout for a drive-in service in a car park.US epicentreThe United States’ top disease expert has signalled a “rolling re-entry” for parts of the country’s economy as early as next month if pandemic restrictions are eased.But Dr Anthony Fauci said new cases of Covid-19 were inevitable after any relaxing of measures and these would need to be managed by health authorities.Dr Fauci said that rather than flipping a switch to reopen the entire country, a gradual process will be needed based on the status of the pandemic in various parts of the US and the availability of rapid, widespread testing.The US is the new epicentre of the pandemic, with more than half a million cases and more than 22,000 deaths, the world’s highest.About half the US deaths have been in the New York metropolitan area, but hospitalisations are slowing in the state and other indicators suggest that lockdowns and social distancing are “flattening the curve” of infections.There are 557,551 cases of Covid-19 in US, according to Johns Hopkins University, more than three times more cases than the country with the next most infections.The Italian government said weekend police patrols resulted in more than 12,500 people being sanctioned and 150 facing criminal charges of violating lockdown measures.On the hopeful side, officials said Italy recorded the lowest number of virus deaths in three weeks, with 431 people dying in the past day to bring its total to around 19,800.But while attention has focused on the US and southern Europe, new coronavirus hot spots have been emerging in Japan and Turkey.Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy, has seen its number of new cases climb rapidly in recent days and now has 7,255 confirmed cases of the virus.Japanese companies have been slow to switch to remote-working and people are still commuting, even after a state of emergency declaration for seven prefectures, including Tokyo.More than 1.8 million infections have been reported and more than 114,000 people have died worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227357.1586707212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"europe pays high price for outsourcing vital health industries to china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron talks to employees as he visits the Kolmi-Hopen face mask factory in Saint-Barthelemy-d’Anjou in central France. Photograph: Loic VenanceAFP via Getty ImagesUntil they were laid low by the coronavirus pandemic, few in Europe or the United States realised how much their countries depended on vital healthcare supplies from Asia. For decades, western countries outsourced surgical masks, ventilators, personal protective equipment and medicines to countries with low labour costs and loose environmental restrictions, mainly China. When disaster struck, western governments were forced to go to outrageous lengths to secure such supplies, often by shafting long-standing allies.In France, for example, the reserve of surgical face masks stood at 140 million, down from a billion a decade earlier. Healthcare professionals are supposed to change masks at least every four hours.During a visit to the main manufacturer of FFP2 surgical masks in France, the Canadian-owned Kolmi-Hopen factory near Anger, President Emmanuel Macron said officials had based decisions on “the certainty that high-quality masks produced on the other side of the world could be imported easily, so there was no reason to stock them massively”.SovereigntyFrance and Europe have learned their lesson, Macron insisted. “The day after will not resemble the days before. We must rebuild our national and European sovereignty.”“Nobody was ready, anywhere in the world,” says an adviser to Macron. In the short term, every country is maximising whatever national production capacity it can salvage, and scrambling to buy from China. Once the crisis passes, “the EU must protect strategic sectors, bring back certain industries, increase our capacity to manufacture and stock in the fields we neglected for decades, such as medicine”.About 80 per cent of the active substances in French medicine are manufactured abroad, mainly in China and India. “We will soon be short of essential medicines to treat Covid-19 patients in intensive care units,” directors of nine large European hospitals warned in Le Monde at the end of March.Three categories of medicine – hypnotic drugs, anaesthetics and tranquillisers – are essential for treating Covid-19, according to doctors interviewed by Radio France.Patients in intensive-care units often develop secondary infections in the lungs, for which they need antibiotics, Jean-Pierre Thierry of France Assos Santé said. “Usually, there are plenty of antibiotics, but there are practically no factories producing them outside China and India.”Ninety per cent of the world’s supply of penicillin, used in antibiotics, is produced in China. India, which is also suffering from the pandemic, has limited exports of 26 medicines and active substances.French doctors have substituted old reliables, such as Valium, for drugs that are in short supply. They are experimenting with lower doses, to conserve stocks. Some advocate using veterinary sedatives. Macron announced he had placed “massive orders” to swell reserves.About 7,000 Chinese factories now manufacture surgical masks, up from 4,000 before the pandemic. According to official figures, the People’s Republic quintupled mask production in February. The Chinese car manufacturer BYD set up the world’s largest mask assembly line and is producing 10 million daily, Le Monde reported. Chinese manufacturers of smartphones and protection pads for incontinence have also converted to mask production.French industry is also scrambling to adapt to the pandemic. Kolmi-Hopen, which Macron visited, increased its workforce by 50 per cent and is operating 247. By late April, it will have increased production from 3.3 million to 10 million masks weekly – still only a fraction of the billion masks that France has ordered from China.Air Liquide, the main French manufacturer of ventilators needed to treat Covid-19, is in the process of increasing production from 200 to 10,000 per month. Engineers from the Schneider Electric company, PSA and Valeo are converting production lines previously devoted to electrical equipment and the manufacture of cars to help make ventilators.Macron previously campaigned for European sovereignty in industries of the future, such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy. The pandemic has shifted the focus to traditional, basic industry.Jobless workers from the last factory that made oxygen bottles in Europe, at Clermont-Ferrand, are campaigning for it to reopen, because the bottles are needed for respirators. The factory was owned by the British group Luxfer. Former employees of an FFP2 surgical mask factory at Plaintel, in Brittany, also hope that the crisis could bring their jobs back. Their factory was purchased by the American group Honeywell in 2010. The Americans shut down the factory and sold its machines as scrap in 2018, when remaining production was outsourced to Tunisia.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227695.1586775130!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"some spaniards head back to work as country loosens lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCommuters wearing face masks sit on a train at the Atocha Station in Madrid on Monday as some companies resumed operations at the end of a two-week halt of all non-essential activity. Photograph: Javier SorianoAFPGetty Images.Spaniards at the country’s main transport hubs were handed face masks on a rainy Monday morning as the government relaxed some of the tough lockdown measures designed to rein in the coronavirus health crisis which has claimed nearly 17,500 lives.As Spain enters its second month of lockdown, some businesses that cannot operate remotely, including construction and manufacturing, were allowed to reopen on Monday, sparking criticism from some regional leaders who fear a resurgence of the outbreak.However, the majority of the population are still confined to their homes, while shops, bars and public spaces will remain closed until at least April 26th.Spain’s overnight death toll from the coronavirus fell to 517 on Monday from Sunday’s 619, bringing the total death toll to 17,489. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019.This is the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began, with the lockdown restrictions helping to slow a spiralling death rate that reached its peak in early April.Interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser radio station that Spanish police started handing out millions of masks early in the morning across regions that are not observing a public holiday.“The health of workers must be guaranteed. If this is minimally affected, the activity cannot restart,” he said.One company reopening, Burgos-based industrial group Nicolas Correa, said it would take measures to prioritise the health of its staff.“We will continue to work in shifts, with staggered entries and exits to avoid concentrations of staff,” it said, adding that all workers would be provided with protective equipment.Reuters TV footage showed only a few commuters coming in and out of the main entrance of Madrid’s usually bustling Atocha train station. Road traffic was light too, with mainly public buses passing by, in contrast to the customary morning jams seen just a month ago.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday the decision to restart some sectors of the economy was taken after consulting a committee of scientific experts and any further winding down would depend on gains made against the virus. -ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Parents of nurse praised by Boris Johnson \u0026#39exceptionally proud\u0026#39 but say \u0026#39this is just what she does\u0026#39Politics live: Government under pressure as lockdown decision loomsComment: NHS managers could learn a thing or two from the militaryThe British victims of coronavirus and their personal storiesSpain starts to relax lockdown as face masks handed out in public spacesCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m self-isolating but can\u0026#39t get an online delivery slot - what should I do?\u0026#39 Our expert answers your questionsWill the UK coronavirus death toll really be as high as we are told?

They would then get tested or self-isolate.But nearly half of French people would refuse to download the “StopCovid” app because of concerns about confidentiality and privacy, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday. The survey by IFOP, a leading polling firm, for the Jean-Jaurès Foundation think tank, suggests that 53 per cent of people would be hostile to a compulsory tracing system using mobile data.The government has indicated that the mobile app would not be compulsory, but the poll suggests that only 46 per cent of French people would agree to use it. Left-wing voters are most opposed to mobile phone tracking, but the number of Right-wing supporters who back the plan is only marginally higher.Cédric O, the digital minister, insisted that the data gathered would be confidential. “It would be a tool installed voluntarily that could be uninstalled at any time. The data would be anonymous and deleted after a certain time.”The government argues that contact tracing has proved effective in South Korea and Singapore in curbing the spread of the virus.Jacques Toubon, France’s ombudsman and a former justice minister, said the need to stem the spread of the virus must be balanced against any restriction of personal freedoms. “We live in a democracy under the rule of law, which confers a certain number of fundamental rights and I am responsible, along with the courts, for ensuring they are respected. Among them is the right to privacy.” Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, called for a parliamentary debate on digital contact tracing, acknowledging that “it raises many questions when there is a need for national unity to exit from the lockdown.” Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has called for a loosening of restrictions to be accompanied by mass testing, with “immunisation certificates” issued to people who have recovered, while those infected could be placed in quarantine.  However, the government has indicated that it is not yet time to consider ending the lockdown. Emmanuel Macron, the president, is expected to announce its extension until at least May 15, possibly longer, in a televised address to the nation on Monday night.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000229343294_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"lockdown hoper not moper woke want live like amish","story":"As we reach the third week of lockdown, we’re reassessing what’s really important to usI’m writing in the third week of the lockdown, when we’re reassessing what’s really important to us and what can go out for the noble bin men when we emerge blinking in the sunshine of the other side. Knowing my own hyper-social tendencies when the weather becomes clement and the fact that my book Welcome To The Woke Trials should be completed by autumn, I should have seen incarceration as a scary blessing which would guarantee delivery. But I actually wondered for a couple of weeks whether I should write it at all – #allinthistogether and all that jazz.Luckily, the copious whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when the Conservative government is acting like Robin Hood has given me renewed purpose.When most people are in denial, they’re in denial about Bad Things – as a coping mechanism – but the Woke are the only group who are permanently in denial about Good Things, such as the generosity of the government, for kicks. It must drive them nuts that we’re finally moving towards a sort of socialism – not a performative brag – in which ordinary people become everyday heroes. The Woke in this crisis remind me of those dogs you see in pubs sometimes, who aren’t really angry, but utter one bark every ten minutes just to keep their equipment running.The preferred leisure activity of the Woke is, of course, virtue-signalling – and don’t they have a brand new box of toys to chuck out of their prams now! Putting on a mask and gloves just to go out for a pint of almond milk they get to feel like bold frontline fighters, looking askance at those of us with the temerity to expose our noses and knuckles.Hearing of hoi polloi relaxing in public spaces they can tut smugly as they tend their herb gardens. On social media they can advocate for avocados as a sure way to wellness with the implication that if one is sensible enough to eat clean nothing so common as the coronavirus would dare invade one’s immaculate innards.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe plague has highlighted the gap between many groups – those who do useful work are more likely to get it than the useless, ethnic minorities are more likely than white people, men than women, smokers than non-smokers. But I’d imagine that it will be spread equally between Modernists (my tribe) and Nostalgics – Hopers vs Mopers, as I think of them. We Hopers can’t wait to rush out and thrown our arms around our one and only world in all its corrupt glory once more the Mopers having got what they wanted – no cheap foreign travel, Mother Nature silencing the city – and are keen to stress that when we get out the other side we must not re-prioritise frivolous things over the simple life.That’s what they say, of course – what they do is entirely different. I wouldn’t despise virtue-signalling so much if it was just a prelude to actual virtue, but I’ve come to believe from extended observation that many practitioners simply use it as a smokescreen that enables them to be even more selfish than the rest of us. The “Woke Cloak” as it’s been called, which led to the amusing spectacle last year of the Extinction Rebellion spokesman who flounced out of an interview after it was pointed out to him that the many skiing trips he had posted on social media were hardly the “emergencies” that he wanted flying to be confined to.So in this time of contemplation, I’d like to speak up for foreign travel, incessant socialising and crazed pleasure-seeking. But for all you Nostalgics who’ve suddenly had the revelation that you wanted to live like an Amish all along, please do stick to your plan of staycations and home-cooking because, to be honest, you don’t bring a great deal in the way of wit and wisdom to the table and I think we’ll just about struggle along without you.And everyone who’s ever spoken or typed the words Big Pharma will hopefully go to the back of the queue when a vaccine is discovered (probably by the Israelis – none for you, boycotters!), stick to their crystals and leave the nasty newfangled vaccines to we shameless embracers of the modern world. And please, have the sensitivity to understand that for the millions of your fellow citizens whose lives were pretty damn simple already – eat, work, sleep, worry about money, repeat – what lies ahead is not a pastoral Walden Pond dream, but a living nightmare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The uncomfortable truth is that, for a large proportion of the population, social-distancing isn’t much of an imposition at all, barring a few tiresome queues at the supermarket.Wealthy professionals in full-time employment, who haven’t yet noticed the economic calamity reeling towards us, can do their jobs from home with little disruption to their working lives, and with the added benefit of spending more time with their families. Some furloughed workers – particularly those who never much liked their jobs to begin with, and on salaries of £20-25,000 a year – are being paid to do nothing, albeit while taking a pay cut. They may even be saving on childcare costs.Public sector employees, meanwhile, are shielded from much of the economic impact I know of teachers on full pay who are being asked to work just a couple of days a month. The long-term impact on their careers of a period in semi-employment will be negligible. MPs have just received a pay rise.Obviously, I don’t wish to force these groups to share in full the sacrifices of the self-employed, the flat-dwellers, the newly-unemployed, and furloughed workers who have seen their incomes collapse because of the penny-pinching failures of the Government’s support package.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedIncidentally, the devastation wrought by lockdown on all sorts of people is being overlooked: households that depend on one larger salary that has evaporated, or entrepreneurs who only recently set up shop. But it does perhaps provide part of the answer to why so many have surrendered their liberties so willingly – and have so little sympathy for those who find it tougher to abide stringently to the lockdown regulations.We are seeing an epidemic of snitching. Hotlines set up to allow members of the public to shop friends, colleagues, neighbours and strangers for breaking the rules have been inundated with calls. Social media is full of misleadingly shot photos of people sitting in parks or going into work on the Tube, accompanied by snide little comments about the “selfishness” of those who have dared go outside and attacks on companies that still expect their staff to come into the office.Where is the common-feeling and unity of purpose we are told is our national strength? If those who are enjoying a relatively comfortable lockdown are unable to “check their privilege”, then these restrictions will not be sustainable much beyond the end of the month. The police cannot be expected to enforce the rules more strictly.While some officers are no doubt enjoying the opportunity to boss around otherwise law-abiding people rather too much, most I have spoken to are anxious not to overstep the mark. They are mindful that, unless a consensus can be maintained behind the rules, then we can add civil disobedience and a collapse in faith in the rule of law to our list of woes.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Teachers must submit each pupil’s predicted grades to the relevant exam boards, which then go through a moderation process before being awarded formally to students later on this summer.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, has said that schools should not ask students to do any new pieces of work to base the predicted grade on. They said that in the interests of fairness, only previous tests and assignments should be used to inform their decision on the predicted grades they submit to exam boards.One mother told The  that her family had been financially ruined and now faces bankruptcy after their income dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic.Her daughter has been made offers to study at prestigious Russell Group universities which are contingent on her predicted grades. But when she contacted her daughter’s school to explain that they were not able to pay the summer term’s fees, she says that she was told without the final instalment of fees for the academic year they would not submit her predicted A-level grades to the exam boards.“There is no way we are in a position to pay fees for next term,” she said. “It seems very cruel to effectively blame the child. It is as though they are holding my daughter’s future to ransom.”Schools were told to shut their doors last month and send pupils home, with many offering online classes and digital learning resources.Private schools are now billing for the summer term, and many are bowing to parental pressure to reduce the fees since children will need to effectively be home schooled.Lord Lucas, a hereditary peer and owner of The Good Schools Guide, said that threatening to withhold predicted grades over this issue is “utterly inhuman” and “totally disgraceful”.“They owe a duty of care to the child,” he said. “You cannot under any circumstances hold a child to ransom in that way.”Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association, said he believes it is rare for a school to withhold grades in a dispute over fees.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists using coronavirus lockdown understand wildlife behaves","story":"As humans around the world have retreated inside, our animal neighbours have ventured further out of hiding. From cougars on the streets of Santiago, to deer in Nara, Japan and ducks crossing the road in Paris, animals that normally live in the shadows of our towns and cities have suddenly emerged into the light, looking for food or merely emboldened to roam. The situation provides a giant experiment in animal behaviour. But for zoologists and conservationists it poses a conundrum.How do you investigate the impact of a lockdown, when you are in lockdown?“I’m fascinated to know what’s going on in terms of how this sudden massive reduction in activity is seen by the animal population, from the roadways to the reduction in noise pollution,” says Graeme Shannon, a zoology lecturer at Bangor University, Wales, down the coast from the town of Llandudno, which was recently invaded by its now infamous mountain goats. “But if you were to plan an experiment like this, there would normally be months of design.”“We can certainly say there’s an impact on the ability of scientists to collect and analyse the data, because they’re not able to get to the field,” said Matt Larsen, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.“It means a lot of these observations are strictly anecdotal.”He recently saw racoons frolicking on the surf near his home in broad daylight - a first on a beach that is normally full of human visitors. In lieu of getting out in the field, scientists across the world are relying on existing camera traps and infrastructure to monitor the changes. Remote monitoring capability has developed at a swift pace in recent years, with lightweight GPS collars enabling real-time tracking and camera tracking sensitive enough to pick up even the smallest mouse. But most of the technology still requires the same maintenance as your TV remote. “We’re quite excited to see if these cameras can keep running. But our challenge is that we can’t go out to change the batteries,” says Mr Shannon, of a project to monitor deer in North Wales. “We’d normally change them around the 60-70 day period. They’re currently on 80-90.”CCTV and road traffic cameras could provide another valuable source of data, especially within cities, but are limited by storage capacity which means footage is often erased after just a few days. Science does have one new helper - ordinary people stuck at home, staring out of their windows. “People can start keeping simple lists of what they see from their windows and that can form a depository of what animals we have in the city. I\u0027ve seen people taking videos of dolphins that have just started to appear off the coast of Mumbai,” says Anish Andheria, the president of India’s Wildlife Conservation Trust.“During the lockdown, even people that are not normally keen on birds, for instance, are suddenly taking notice.Relying on citizen science has its shortcomings.Most of the sightings are in areas that are already home to plenty of animals - merely unbeknownst to their human inhabitants, who are normally at work or otherwise distracted.“In India every other day we have reports of tigers and lions entering villages, even during normal time. Suddenly now we’re seeing these videos, but a lot of them are not even dated, so this data is questionable,” says Mr Andheria. And images and videos are not always that reliable. Several of the images that have gone viral - of swans and dolphins returning to Venice, or drunk elephants roaming through a Chinese village - have turned out to be false. Then there is the question of the scientific value of such a period of unnatural upheaval. “I think it’s more of a curiosity, I don’t think it’s going to yield great new scientific understanding,” says Mr Larsen.  “As soon as people start re-appearing in cities and towns the animals are going to retreat and this will have just been an unusual vacation for them,” says Mr Larsen. For animals that exist on the waste of urban life, this time will be more of a struggle than a holiday and could have some fatal consequences. “We have a lot of feral dogs here in Mumbai, so what is going to happen when we see them interacting with the wild animals that are going to come out more looking for food?” Mr Andheria says.“One impact could be increased disease transfer from animal to animal as they are forced into greater interaction with each other.” What might be overturned in this period are our assumptions about what can be considered “natural” behaviour for our urbanite wildlife, and what is imposed by the encroachment of humans. “I think the key thing we’ll see is the times of day animals might be using areas. Many urban species are suddenly using the daytime as they would the night,” Mr Shannon says.“If you really want to get dark about it, this is kind of a macabre vision of what would happen if humans disappeared,” says Mr Larsen.And though many of these animals are likely to slink back into the shadows when humans re-emerge, there could be a painful period of readjustment.One possibility is an uptick in traffic accidents, as roads unexpectedly fill up with traffic again. “On the more positive side hopefully some people by having this experience will maybe have a deeper appreciation for the values of our natural systems,” says Mr Larsen.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000228189501_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdPLLMxOyt4fQUM0ggA6t9IvMhyWP1NlODfwi1fLYifY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"coronavirus qa self isolating cant get online delivery slot","story":"Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottoms of this article for our Consumer Champion Katie Morley Coronavirus Article Bar with counter .The coronavirus outbreak has caused panic buying in the UK after supermarket shelves were left empty as shoppers prepared for a three-week UK lockdown to stem the spread.Retailers have been quick to respond to the increased demand, putting in place restrictions on the number of products customers can buy, as well as changing store opening times and online delivery slots to benefit elderly and vulnerable customers, and key workers.Some stores, including Tesco and Waitrose, have scrapped their buy-one-get-one-free offers.Supermarkets have been supplied with a list of 1.5 million vulnerable customers who have been told to self-isolate for at least 12 weeks.

Leave your questions for Katie in the comments section below or email them to yourstory@telegraph.Sainsbury\u0027s customers are only able to buy a maximum of three of any grocery products and a maximum of two on the most popular items, such as toilet roll, soap and UHT milk.As we work to feed the nation, we are also focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can, Mike Coupe, the retailer’s chief executive, said.We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families.Shoppers faced with empty shelves in a London supermarketTesco has introduced restrictions across all their stores only allowing three items per customer on every product line. They have also removed multi-buy promotions.Asda is restricting all items to a maximum of three per customer across all food items, toiletries and cleaning products.“We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,” the supermarket said in a statement. Morrisons has restricted all product lines both in store and online to three per customer to ensure everyone has access to everyday essentials. Some high demand items have been restricted to two, including hand sanitiser and toilet roll.Lidl have announced quantity restrictions across some of their products. They have advised customers to check in store for more details.Meanwhile, as part of a joint statement released last week with other supermarkets, they have called on customers to be “considerate” in the way they shop.The statement read: “We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.”Aldi has now lifted some of the temporary restrictions which limited the number of items shoppers could buy. Customers can now only buy four of the following products:Hand wash and soapCanned tomatoes, canned beans and sausagesBeers, wines and spiritsAnd two of the following products:John Lewis and Waitrose have become the latest retailers to announce limits on the purchase of some items amid the coronavirus pandemic. Waitrose, which is part of John Lewis Partnership, has announced a three-item limit on certain products and a limit of two packets of toilet roll. They said in a statement: “help us help all our customers - particularly those who are sick or vulnerable - by only buying what you need. That way we can ensure there will be enough food and groceries for everyone”.John Lewis has announced it is closing its stores.Shoppers queue to enter the Costco wholesale supermarket in north LondonIceland have placed a temporary cap on some items, such as antibacterial wipes and soap. They have also urged people to shop in an “appropriate way for the needs of your family and considering other customers when selecting products in our stores, and we would ask you to be considerate towards our colleagues”.The Co-op supermarket has become the latest to introduce rationing in its stores, limiting customers to two items of any product, and just one box of eggs.Government ministers and retailers have been discussing ways of ensuring that vulnerable people without access to online shopping are not left without food if they have to self-isolate. Retailers have begun implementing measures to protect these customers. Sainsbury\u0027s supermarkets will now open between 8am to 8pm, Monday to Saturday. They have announced NHS and social care workers will be able shop half an hour before stores open each day between 7.30-8.00am, Monday to Saturday. Additionally, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday 8.00-9.00am will be dedicated to serving elderly and disabled customers, as well as carers.Mike Coupe, CEO, said in a statement: I hope that you can respect this decision and will work with us as we try our best to help those that need it most.Sainsbury\u0027s will also be updating their online shopping availability, and from March 23 they will be adding priority access to online delivery slots for customers aged over 70, or those who have a disability.They have also identified vulnerable online shoppers through previously provided information and will be emailing them with information about available delivery slots.Tesco has announced all their stores, except Express stores, will be prioritising the elderly and most vulnerable for one hour between 9am and 10am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Every Sunday NHS workers who provide a valid ID can shop in Tesco\u0027s larger stores an hour before checkouts open.Asda are offering NHS staff priority access to stores on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8.00-9.00am. While from Friday 20 March from opening time to 9am their superstores will be dedicated to helping vulnerable shoppers.An NHS hour will be in place in Morrisons stores from 7am to 8am Monday to Saturday. Meanwhile, the supermarket chain will be recruiting around 2,500 pickers and drivers, as well as 1,000 staff in its distribution centres to expand its online shopping services.It will make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping, such as the elderly.Iceland stores offer exclusive shopping hours for elderly and vulnerable customers, NHS staff and social care workers.From Monday to Saturday, Iceland\u0027s hours are as follows:First hour of trading: priority hours for elderly and vulernable people.Last hour of trading: NHS staff only with valid IDFrom Friday 20 March, the first opening hour in all their stores will be dedicated to elderly and vulnerable shoppers, as well as their carers. Waitrose has announced they will keep daily essentials aside for NHS workers, they will be given priority treatment at checkouts and John Lewis Partners are putting together care packages to deliver to NHS facilities around the country.Aldi has not announced any varied opening times for older customers, but they have donated £250,000 to Age UK. “In these difficult times it’s important for us all to look after the most vulnerable people in our communities,” Aldi said in a statement.“This donation will help to ensure that Age UK\u0027s vital services can stay open during this challenging time, helping to ensure that they can continue to support vulnerable members of the community who may not be able to get out to our stores.”Shoppers leave a branch of Sainsbury\u0026#39s supermarket after an early \u0026#34Elderly and vulnerable shopper\u0026#34 periodBoris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has said the government is “absolutely confident” in the UK supply chains. “We will get farm to fork food supplies for this country and therefore people should have no reason to stockpile or panic buy,” he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has authorised a temporary relaxation, until April 16, of the drivers\u0027 hours rules to help deliver goods to stores across the country.A Department for Transport statement said the relaxation applies only to drivers supplying food and essential products to supermarkets.This includes the movement of such goods from importers, manufactures and suppliers to distribution centres. It does not apply to drivers undertaking deliveries directly to consumers, the statement added.Stores have also reassured customers they are doing all they can to ensure their shelves remain full and their supply chains running smoothly. Waitrose have said: “We would like to reassure you that we are currently working as hard as possible to keep a good range of everyday products available, and are working closely with our suppliers to help meet continuing demand.”Tesco has also reduced the hours of all its stores, with all stores closing at 10pm. Last week, it was forced to take its mobile app offline temporarily due to high demand.A spokeswoman said the reduced hours: gives our colleagues the time overnight to restock the store, replenish the shelves and support our online grocery service at a time when demand is high.They will also be closing all meat, fish, deli counters and salad bars, to allow staff to focus on restocking shelves and providing essentials.Tips for sticking to official hygiene adviceWaitrose cafes and rotisseries will be temporarily shut to help stores cope with increased demand in other areas. Due to the high demand of their online shopping service the cut off time to make changes to orders is now 12 noon. Asda will also be closing its 24 hour stores between 12am and 6am temporarily. The company said in a statement the move was to “ensure (staff) have the time to re-stock and thoroughly clean the store so it is ready for customers”.In a bid to prioritise essential items, free up warehouse space and employees, Asda will also be temporarily closing services such as cafes and pizza counters.Aldi has changed their closing times so all stores will now close at 8pm. Lidl has announced some store opening times have changed, and are encouraging customers to check their local store for details.Iceland\u0027s opening hours from Monday through Saturday are now 9am to 5pm.

Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But after the breakdown in relations with Russia in early March it jacked up production to 11 million barrels a day.So some of those headline cuts merely offset the supply glut from the recent price war. There’s a formidable amount of black stuff in storage in ships and containers around the planet to get through.And then there’s the demand element of the equation to consider.The unprecedented lockdowns ordered by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has seen global demand for energy plummet by around 30 per cent.OPEC itself expected global oil demand to fall by 20 million barrels a day in April.That puts the 10 million barrels a day production cuts in the right context.As Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad\u0026nbspEnergy\u0026nbspputs it OPEC has “only come up with half of the ransom money”.You can’t buck the market, as someone once said.Energy analysts are also doubtful about whether the production cuts will actually be delivered.OPEC is not the cohesive force that it once was. The cartel has suffered from indiscipline internally. Can countries such as Iraq and Nigeria be relied on not to break ranks as their exchequers come under massive pressure in the coming months? And OPEC allies are not necessarily reliable either, as the fiasco with Russia clearly demonstrates.“Trust, but verify,” was the cautious view of the US towards Soviet nuclear disarmament pledges during the Cold War. Markets seem to be taking a similar attitude to production cuts now.And yet it’s possible to see something new emerging from the chaos of this price war, in particular the pressure successfully applied by Donald Trump to his Saudi allies and also Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The endorsement of the planned OPEC cuts by G20 energy ministers last week could also be significant.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A deal to curb supply reduces some of that danger.These are early days of course. But international co-ordination on oil production could be a significant legacy of this crisis. It’s far too early to talk about global recovery when we are still on the terrifying downward slope, but more a more stable energy market could help underpin it when it eventually arrives.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As though possessed by a collective mania, the residents of the Derbyshire town of Belper threw back their heads and began to moo like cattle…Though it sounds unlikely, this scene has become reality in lockdown Britain in 2020.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEvery afternoon at the allotted time, “hundreds” of people in Belper have broken the silence of the coronavirus\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspto channel the plaintive cries of incarcerated livestock.The bizarre ritual is the creation of local man Jasper Ward, who told BBC Radio 5 Live the bovine bellowing had made staying at home “a little bit more bearable”.“The crazy people of this town have taken to it like cows to grass,” he said.Created with Sketch.The 25 most remarkable animal pictures of the past decade Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the Eagle825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the EagleMr Ward said he expected the project to last for a few days and would end with him being “ridiculed on social media”.Jaw-dropping video reveals supermarket workers using microphones\u0026nbspto announce that they are about to commence mooing, and inviting shoppers to join in.\u0026nbsp“We’re three weeks in and at six thirty there’s a chorus of moos,” said Mr Ward – who is now assuredly a hero in his hometown.A twitter page has even been created cataloguing the caterwauling citizens of Belper – many of whom are using additional rudimentary contrivances to amplify their guttural calls.\u0026nbspHow to eat healthily while in lockdownHow SNL’s at-home episode hit all the right notesHow socks became the unexpected fashion hero of lockdownAccording to the BBC, one resident, Isabel Kennedy, “has mooed since day one”.She told the broadcaster: “It’s a great way to get the community together – be part of something in these crazy and weird times.

It’s great many of them will be able to do\u0026nbspsome of the things we normally associate with Easter, like enjoying chocolate, and our volunteers loved being able to add these to our deliveries.”The Felix Project has been ferrying over 20 tonnes of food each day to three of the huge community hubs established by London borough councils over the past two weeks – more than double the 10 tonnes a day it was supplying in normal times.In a bid to make the city-wide operation as efficient as possible, the charity has also forged an alliance with the two other big food surplus charities – FareShare and City Harvest – to create the London Food Alliance.“The food industry has really stepped up to help us – there’s been a brilliant response,” said CEO Mark\u0026nbspCurtin. “There’s still a huge amount of food coming from all our suppliers. And we’re doing everything we can to get that increased volume out where it’s needed.”The meal-kit company HelloFresh provides a regular supply of its surplus fruit and vegetables to the charity – and donated £25,000 to help the charity scale up its operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Surfers hit the breaks on Whitesands Bay, tourists rent kayaks and coasteering guides, and\u0026nbspthen fill up on pasties called oggies before heading back to caravans and campsites.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastInstead, businesses have either sent staff home on furlough, reinvented themselves… or packed up.St Davids Cross Hotel, which has 16 rooms costing up to £145 a night, had been fully booked this weekend and most of next week. More than 100 guests have cancelled.“With the weather we’ve got down in Pembrokeshire at the moment, it’s been absolutely glorious for the last week and it’s going to be very nice next week,” says Alex Perkins, the hotel’s manager. “I suppose now we just hope that we’ll make it up in the summer or the winter.”Initially, the three-star hotel tried to adapt to the pandemic with takeaway food, and even put on a delivery Sunday roast service for Mother’s Day. But as time went on, the owners decided to completely shut and furlough the staff to reduce chances of transmitting the virus. “We’d rather people do stay at home than travel down to us,” Alex adds.Down the road, The Meadow cafe has made a slightly more unusual operational swerve. Co-owner Nick Michell has set up a health and fitness training service, offering one-to-one training through an app\u0026nbspand remote coaching.The 47-year-old says: “I was a personal trainer beforehand and I was intending to incorporate some of my services into what we do at the cafe, with a wellbeing offering.” Now that the cafe has closed, the fitness plans have been jolted into fruition.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be extremely busy – Easter’s always a very busy time down here anyway because it’s the first of the big holidays after winter.”The farmhouse-style\u0026nbspcafe will benefit from the business rate relief, and the owners will take up the government’s offer to pay 80 per cent of the salary for the 10 furloughed staff. In the summer, another 10 workers are usually hired – a marker of the boom of the local economy in the tourist season. But the virus could wipe\u0026nbspout work for locals. St Davids has a population of around 1,600 but the city’s visitors reach into the hundreds of thousands throughout the year.As for business loans that are being made available by the Welsh government, Nick, who has an 18-month-old daughter, is not keen. “Loans are loans and you’ve got to pay them back,” he says. “With any new business, you invest significantly at the start. So we have already invested quite a lot anyway. We’re reluctant to refinance, to continue reinvesting with the unknown that is the future.”Unknown really is the word – the three-week lockdown marker is about to arrive, with no sign of an end yet in sight. And if we’re slowly eased out of paralysis, cafes, hotels and restaurants fear\u0026nbspmeasures will still restrict customers.The pandemic has hit at a cruel time. “We rely on from now until September to get probably 75 per cent of our income for the year,” Nick adds. His wife Emma, a yoga instructor, may soon be joining him in setting up remote classes.Back at the cathedral, Dean Sarah Rowland Jones still has high spirits. “We’ve got a community WhatsApp group, there’s stuff on Facebook, there’s a lot of people ringing each other up,” she says. “People are being particularly assiduous in looking out for one another. The rest of the year, the resident community is small. So in that sense, it’s quite easy to know who’s who and to watch out for everybody.”The locals who make up the congregation are also still able to join in by watching the cathedral’s YouTube videos, she adds.And at a time of uncertainty, at least they can be fairly sure that next year’s\u0026nbspEaster Sunday service won’t\u0026nbspbe held in the bishop’s\u0026nbspkitchen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only difference is that now I stand with my megaphone and shout, ‘Guys, please, two metres apart, you’re still going to get served, two metres apart, please.’”James Bardrick, head of Citi UK, said their donation to Help The Hungry\u0026nbspcomprised a combination of company money and an (as yet unknown) aggregation of employee donations which could conceivably exceed the £50,000 minimum pledged by the bank.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastHe added: “Our employees want to support those struggling.

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial.

Liberal Democrats were down a point on 10 per cent with Greens on 6 and the Brexit Party on 2.Labour voters showed strong approval of Sir Keir’s leadership, with 49 per cent satisfied, against just 7 per cent who were not.

Some 22 per cent of non-voters voiced satisfaction at\u0026nbspSir Keir’s\u0026nbspleadership, against 9 per cent who were dissatisfied.Strongest support for the new Labour leader was found in his native London (33 per cent satisfied against 11 per cent dissatisfied) and the West Midlands (39-11). But he appeared to have made less of a breakthrough in the northeast, where the margin of satisfaction was just 21-14, and Scotland (26-7).He enjoyed his strongest approval among the 18- to 24-year-old age group (36 per cent satisfied, 11 per cent dissatisfied).

Some people will even tell you that the locusts are more destructive than the coronavirus. There are even some who don’t believe that the virus will reach here.”Some farmers in Mr Abokat’s village near the Kenyan border bang metal pans, whistle or throw stones to try to drive the locusts away. But mostly they watch in frustration, largely barred by a coronavirus lockdown from gathering outside their homes.A failed garden of cassava, a local staple, means hunger. Such worries in the village of some 600 people are reflected across a large part of East Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan. The locust swarms also have been sighted in Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania and Congo.The UN\u0026nbspFood and Agriculture Organisation\u0026nbsp(FAO) has called the locust outbreak, caused in part by climate change, “an unprecedented threat” to food security and livelihoods. Its officials have called this new wave some 20 times the size of the first.Army of 100,000 ducks deployed to combat locust infestationLocust swarms cross into hunger-hit South Sudan‘Catastrophe’: Biggest locust swarm in decades triggers dire warning“The current situation in East Africa remains extremely alarming as ... an increasing number of new swarms are forming in Kenya, southern Ethiopia and Somalia,” a new FAO assessment said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFavourable breeding conditions through May mean there likely will be another new round of swarms in late June and July, coinciding with the start of the harvest season, the agency said.The UN\u0026nbsphas raised its aid appeal from $76m (£61m) to $153m, saying immediate action is needed before more rainfall fuels further growth in locust numbers. So far the FAO has collected $111m\u0026nbspin cash or pledges.The locusts are “invading the Eastern Africa region in exceptionally large swarms like never seen before”,\u0026nbspthe Nairobi-based Climate Prediction and Application Centre said.The new swarms include “young adults”,\u0026nbspvoracious bugs “that eat more than the adult ones”,\u0026nbspsaid Kenneth Mwangi, a satellite information analyst at the centre.Mr Mwangi and other officials in Kenya cited difficulties in fighting the infestation as coronavirus-related travel restrictions slow cross-border travel and delay the delivery of pesticides.The verification work of field officers has been curtailed, making it harder for the centre to update regional prediction models, Mr Mwangi said.In rural Laikipia county, among the worst affected in Kenya, some are calling attention to the threat to commercial farms.“I think, unfortunately, because of other things going on around the world, people are forgetting about the problem with the locusts. But it’s a very, very real problem,” farmer George Dodds told the FAO.Aerial spraying is the only effective way to control the locust outbreak. After the locusts crossed into Uganda for the first time since the 1960s, soldiers resorted to using hand-held spray pumps because of difficulties in obtaining the needed aircraft.Uganda’s agriculture minister said authorities are unable to import enough pesticides from Japan, citing disruptions to international cargo shipments.The government is yet to meet an additional budget of over $4m requested for locust control, the minister said.The sum is substantial in a country where the president has been fundraising from wealthy people to help respond to the virus and its economic disruption. Health workers are threatening to strike over lack of protective gear.In Ethiopia, where some 6 million people live in areas affected by the locust outbreak, the infestation if unchecked “will cause large-scale crop, pasture and forest-cover loss, worsening food and feed insecurity”,\u0026nbspthe FAO says.Bands of immature locusts are forming in areas that include the country’s breadbasket, the Rift Valley region, it said.Ethiopia’s agriculture minister has said efforts are under way to deploy six helicopters against the infestation that could last until late August.But ministry spokesman Moges Hailu spoke of an ominous sign: the locust swarms are now appearing in locations where they had not been previously sighted.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But we must phase it out at the earliest opportunity.It could lead to many more deaths than the virus itself as the economy tanks, people lose jobs and families get poorer and sicker. We need a game plan for ending this.One key Government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months.Stringent lockdown measures must remain in place beyond next week, Mr Raab - the Foreign Secretary, who is standing in for Boris Johnson while hes recovering at Chequers - confirmed on April .He didnt indicate when exactly the stay-at-home orders will be lted.At a press briefing, Raab said: The measures will have to stay in place, until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we have moved beyond the peak.I know these restrictions take their toll, day in day out. On people’s livelihoods, on people’s quality of le, on people’s mental health.And I appreciate that it’s often the little things that hurt the most.It’s been almost three weeks, and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising, and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lt the measures that we’ve put in place. We must stick to the plan. And we must continue to be guided by the science.Nearly , people have already died from coronavirus in the UK, as of April , while more than , have tested positive for the bug.Mr Raab also said: SAGEwill meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and well keep the measures we put in place under review.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned outdoor exercise could be bannediniduals continue to ignore social distancing measures.Englands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty said he would expect the number of deaths to continue rising for at least two weeks past when the number of people in intensive care starts to flatten off, showing the peak is still some time away.Government advisers now believe April  is the likely peak date.The UKs three-week lockdown mark will be reached on Easter Monday.Legislation behind the mass containment must also be reviewed at least once every  days - with the first due to be carried out by April  at the latest.No easing of the lockdown will happen until at least the end of next week, Mr Raab said - but the strict measures will likely continue for even longer, with suggestions that some form of restrictions could last for up to  months until a vaccine has been developed.Ministers have warned that the lockdown could be stretched into May, after warning that relaxing it too soon will kill thousands more.Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has previously told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.Englands Health Minister Ed Argar said the country was not at the stage where the lockdown can be relaxed.The lockdown is expected to be lted in stages amid Treasury fears that businesses wont survive past June.On April , the Mayor of London suggested the peak of the virus was ten days away.Sadiq Khan said: I think we’re nowhere near lting the lockdown.I speak to experts regularly, we think the peak, which is the worst part of the virus, is probably a week and a half away.A joint survey on the impact of the coronavirus lockdown upon , UK residents found that % are drinking more booze, and % are arguing with their family or housemates more than normal.Halfreported feeling more anxious or depressed as a result of coronavirus, while one in fivesaid they already cannot afford essential items or housing costs, the survey by Kings College London and Ipsos Mori found.April : Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announces it is too soon to lt social distancing restrictions,  with SAGE to review the restrictions after Easter Monday.April : The Prime Minister is admitted to hospital for treatment, ten days after first displaying coronavirus symptoms on  March.March : Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling us to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus. Certain businesses and venues were ordered to close, including pubs, hair and beauty salons, places of worship and campsitesMarch : Police get new powers, allowing them to fine Brits flouting lockdown rules £ - or £ for second-time offendersApril : Cops are told to tone down heavy-handed enforcement, after drones were used to spot people visiting beauty spots, and checkpoints were set up at some locationsPublic gatherings are limited to a maximum of two people and weddings are cancelled.A letter from the Prime Minister has landed on the doorsteps of  million households across the UK.In it, Boris Johnson urges people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Hes also outlined guidance that everyone should follow, and the measures the government has put in place to fight the new killer bug, and to support businesses and workers.His message follows a letter sent out by NHS England to those considered extremely vulnerable to contracting the virus.That letter warns recipients that because they have an underlying disease or health condition, they are more likely to be admitted to hospital.Theyve been told to avoid all face-to-face contact for at least twelve weeks, except from carers and healthcare workers.Italy was the first Western country to introduce widespread restrictions and has tightened them week by week, banning all but core activities, says Reuters.It signed an order on January  shutting down flights to and from China.In early March the country was the epicentre of Europes coronavirus outbreak, and thus quarantined million people in the countrys north to contain the killer bug.The government initially imposed a lockdown on the northern region of Lombardy and parts of neighbouring Veneto - where eery images emerged of a tourist-free Venice.By March , any movement within Italy was banned, including across municipalities, with cops issuing fines in Romes to those outside their homes with no valid excuse.Italy will extend anti-coronavirus lockdown restrictions imposed last month to April , meaning that most shops, bars and restaurants will remain closed for now.But there are hopes that some restrictions will start to be lted.The Italian government is looking at plans for shops to resume trading and people toto work after being in lockdown for a month.France went into lockdown on March  with police patrolling streets to ensure people only leave their homes for essential reasons.On April  it decided to extend measure beyond April , as its death toll has soared to about ,.Spain - whose national health emergency chief has Covid- - is in a state of emergency and has called for non-essential workers to stay at home for  days from Monday, March .There are tough restrictions in place in badly-effected areas such as Madrid with all educational institutions forced to close.Meanwhile, in the US, each state is reacting in dferent ways to the pandemic - some have closed schools and businesses, but others have taken a weaker approach, including in Arkansas, where the governor said restaurants could continue operating,they chose.Calornians have been ordered to stay at home, as have those living in Colorado and Connecticut, among other states, reports Aljazeera.But it wasnt until April  that Floridas Governor, Ron DeSantis, ordered residents to remain at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by science.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must phase it out at the earliest opportunity.It could lead to many more deaths than the virus itself as the economy tanks, people lose jobs and families get poorer and sicker. We need a game plan for ending this.”Caretaker PM Dominic Raab can’t settle the dispute because his role is to chair meetings and carry out his boss’s orders.And with Boris Johnson likely to be away for another three weeks, the government is in danger of becoming rudderless.An insider said: “There’s a bit of a power vacuum. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic and we need him back — but he’s got to be left to rest and get well.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson fears a longer schools closure will dash the le chances of poor and vulnerable kids.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealMinisters had planned for one in five pupils, the children of key workers, to stay in class yet only two per cent did so.And the Chancellor is shocked that his job retention scheme attracted nine million claims — three times more than he expected.The overall cost to the economy will be nudging £billion by the end of the long Easter weekend.It comes as it is revealed that second home-owners could be eligible for a £, hand-out because of a loophole in the Government’s coronavirus aid scheme.The oversight could put cash into the hands of well-off property owners - and cost the taxpayer billions of pounds.Eventhey agree a date, ministers still have to work out how far to go in ing Britain to normal.Medics and scientists warn that a swtcould lead to a second wave of the virus, with an even more devastating effect.One option is to lt restrictions on dferent regions or sectors. Some are pushing for young people — less prone to serious illness from the virus — toto work first.But a sceptic remarked: “It’s the over-s with the money and experience who are the wealth creators. We need them back soon.”Without a game plan, there are fears that tough limits could still be in place this time next year.The First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, has rightly said that there is a huge team spirit behind the Prime Minister, willing him on to get back to full health and back where he rightly belongs – leading the Government and our country from  Downing Street.It is important that the business of Government continues at pace during the Prime Minister’s temporary absence from the Downing Street tiller, eventhat is for some time. Decisions, even signicant and dficult decisions, must still be taken by the Cabinet as and when necessary.In this country, we have a system of Government where key decisions are taken by the Cabinet. It is, of course, true that the Prime Minister has signicant personal authority, especially where there is disagreement.However, while the Prime Minister is out of action, his authority will be exercised by Dominic Raab, the First Secretary of State, because he is the Prime Minister’s chosen deputy.Ministers, I am sure, will be very conscious of the fact that it was the Prime Minister who made that choice and he will expect it to be respected. I am sure the Prime Minister will not be amused to read about what has been going on in Cabinet committees in his Sunday newspapers.When the Prime Minister announced the current restrictions on  March, he said this would be reviewed after three weeks. The time for this review is next week.Given we are yet to reach the peak of the virus, I am quite sure that next week the Government will formally decide that the current restrictions will have to stay in place for another three weeks into May.The data on the number of new cases is starting to suggest that the current social distancing measures are working but continuing with them for another period is necessary to ensure we protect the NHS and save lives.That’s why people need to continue to stay at home over the Easter weekend, apart from the four allowed exceptions. Thinking about the future, we will only be able toto something like normal le once we have created a vaccine.This is likely to take somewhere between - months and so, in the meantime, we will need a recovery plan that continues to protect the health of the nation whilst allowing us to get the economy going again.The Government must work on that recovery plan at pace whilst it continues with the current restrictions and it must also be as open as possible with the public about what that plan will look like as and when the pieces are put into place. There are three reasons for this.First, whilst the vast majority of the population has been doing a fantastic job complying with the rules so far, the longer the restrictions are in place, the more likely we are to continue this level of compliancethe public can see the light at the end of the tunnel.Second, over the coming days and weeks, the many people in our country who are self-employed or who run larger companies are going to need to take decisions about the future of their businesses.So we need to give them as much information as we can, as soon as we can, about the future so they are prepared to take the calculated risks necessary to keep their businesses going. That’s vitally importantwe’re going to minimise the economic cost of defeating this virus.Finally, any recovery plan is likely to involve a signicant volume of testing, with contact tracing and perhaps the use of technology seen in countries like South Korea to ensure any resurgence of virus can be dealt with swtly.As we have seen from the challenges facing the Government on testing for NHS frontline staff, it takes time to get this capacity in place.We need to make sure than when the Government is confident that the evidence is in place to allow a relaxation of the current measures, our testing capability, and all that goes with it, is ready to be rolled out quickly.I am confident that the Cabinet, led by the First Secretary of State Dominic Raab in the Prime Minister’s absence, will continue working hard and making the necessary decisions when they need to be made so that the PM, upon histo health, can hit the ground running and, as the Prime Minister’s great hero Sir Winston Churchill would say, take “action this day”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have a hole in my heart and an enlarged heart. Whenever I get the flu or colds, it goes straight to my chest. Am I more vulnerable to coronavirus A. Yes. You are more vulnerable with any form of heart disease and you need to stay home, socially distance and wash your hands regularly.Q. I have a regular B injection. Am I more vulnerable A. Having regular vitamin B injections will not make you more vulnerable nor will any underlying medical condition, which has caused B deficiency.Q. How can you keep safe when going shopping A. Try to do it infrequently and don’t travel too far. If there is a queue stand two metres away from everyone  and keep your distance from the checkout. You can still be sociable and polite. Try to choose shops where the staff are wearing protective equipment. When you get home, throw away packaging and wash your hands. Q. Should I use antiseptic wipes on my food shop when I unpack A. Antiseptic wipes only have a very weak effect on bugs and germs on packaging. For cleaning the virus from surfaces you really need a chlorine-based cleaning product, such as bleach. For your hands, use a product containing rubbing alcohol of at least  per cent strength.Q. Is it safe to continue to take fluticasone nasal drops and nitro-furantoin capsules I have been prescribed  I am concerned they could weaken my immune system.A. While the nasal drops are steroids which reduce inflammation they only act locally. The nitrofurantoin anti- biotics will make no dference whatsoever. You should continue to use your medication as the benefits are far greater than the risks.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealQ. My partner is terminally ill and I have diabetes. I am a key worker. Should I self-isolate for  weeks A. What awful decisions so many of us have to make. While your husband is in the high risk group, you are categorised in the vulnerable group and you should work from homeyou can and keep a physical distance from others.Key workers may continue to work under the current guidance but you need to take extra-special care of yourself. You could also ask your bossyou can work in a non public-facing role.Q. I work in the NHS in a child development centre. One of the nurses advised to shower and change my clothes at home because my husband has an autoimmune condition. Is this really necessary A. I think going to these s is unnecessary unless you are a healthcare professional exposed to high levels of risk, seeing potentially in-fected patients.If you are washing your hands regularly you will not be transmitting any virus from clothes or hair to your face this should be sufficient.Q. I’m , a diabetic on insulin and a key worker. Should I be working A. Diabetes puts you into the more vulnerable group being advised to work from homepossible. Key workers, however, are an exception and while you can still go to work it is worth askingyour role can be adapted so you are not in a public facing role.Practice very strict personal hygiene too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating.

It comes after the death total hit , over the weekend. Scientists will today begin reviewing what changes millions of Brits staying at home has had on the virus spread. Ministers are due to discuss the measures later this week - with an update expected by Thursday.Insiders are keen to stress that while the measures are being reviewed in line with a promise from Boris Johnson to review them after three weeks, radical changes are not expected.It comes as Mr Johnson continues his recovery from Covid- at Chequers in Buckinghamshire after doctors ordered the Prime Minister to rest. Ministers have said they want to be sure the UK is past the peak of the outbreak before easing the restriction. But  members of the Cabinet are reportedly urging lockdown conditions to be eased amid concerns about the impact on the economy. The Times quoted an unnamed minister as saying it was important not to do more damage, and measures could be eased after another three weeks.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who warned during his Budget last month that the UK risks falling into recession as a result of disruption caused by coronavirus, has injected £ billion from the coronavirus emergency response fund into the NHS and local authorities.But the Government continues to face pressure over shortages of personal protective equipmentfor frontline NHS staff, as a growing number of health workers died. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast the supply of gowns - imported from China - was hand-to-mouth. He said the NHS ordered a whole load of stock weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the product sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He said: If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered andall of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply. But he added the vast majority of NHS preparations had gone extremely well and no trusts had yet run out of gowns.  At the weekend, the Royal College of Nurses issued new guidance that nurses who could not get adequate PPE should, as a last resort, refuse to work. On Sunday the Department of Health said, as of pm on Saturday, a total of , patients had died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, up by  from , the day before. Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a new NHS coronavirus app which the Government hopes will help stem the spread of the virus by helping people to self-isolate before they start showing symptoms. He said developers of the app, which is currently being tested, were working with the worldaposs leading tech companies and experts in clinical safety and digital ethics so that we can get this right.  Making the announcement at the daily Downing Street press conference, he said: If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that youaposve been in signicant contact with over the past few days. This should mean people can act even before they have symptoms.

The lionising of a Prime Minister thankfully released from hospital only adds insult to the terrible injury endured by families mourning lost loved ones. Deputising Dominic Raab boasting his boss is “a fighter” was grotesquely insensitive: thousands of husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters didn’t perish from lack of courage yet some almost certainly died who could’ve been saved. Justice and maintaining le demands we scrutinise Johnson’s errors, Britain’s toll of , deaths in hospitals alone a loss far greater than Germany’s under , in a larger population despite the coronavirus infecting both countries around the same moment. The warning from one of the Government’s most senior scientic advisers, Jeremy Farrar, that the UK’s likely to be among the European nations hit hardest, possibly even the worst, surpassing Italy, France and Spain, is a brutal condemnation of a PM slow to act. Failing to prioritise tests, masks and ventilators cost lives, probably including NHS workers. Johnson’s boast at the beginning on March  he was shaking hands with everyone in a hospital, lying it had coronavirus patients, was the blasé recklessness of a politician more worried a lockdown might damage his popularity than doing what was right.

The tot underwent open heart surgery and endured problems with her windpipe but after months of treatment she stood a good chance of recovery.However, last Friday, she was confirmed as having the killer bug and be treated at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital in Liverpool, Mail Online reports.She is on a Continuous Positive Airway Pressuremachine that supplies her with oxygen with her -year-old mum Emma Bates with her side.  For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Only one parent can stay with her so her dad Wayne, , is self-isolating at the family home in Bury, Greater Manchester, because of the contact he has had with his poorly daughter. The couple are keeping in contact by phone calls and regular Facetime video chats. Mr and Mrs Bates believe that because Erin has already beaten so many battles in her short le that she can win this latest fight. However they are angry that some members of the public are still flouting the lockdown rules which may result in the virus continuing to spread. Mr Bates, a mechanic for Toyota, old Mail Online: People are still not taking this outbreak seriously and that upsets me. I take it personally. There was a picture Iaposve seen of a beach where there was an ice cream hut open with people queuing outside like it was a normal day. It horries me that people still are not sticking to the lockdown measures. It does upset both of us. Mrs Bates wrote on Facebook : All I’m seeing lately is jokes about coronavirus. I understand humour is very important to keep you going through this hard time but please think about those people it does effect.Our little girl has lung and heart disease and floppy airways and is still currently sitting in intensive care,our little girl catches this virus she won’t be as lucky to fight it. The anxiety every time a new nurse or doctor comes into our bay is getting unbearable. And the simplest things like going to get a drink downstairs now scares me so much so that I don’t and I isolate myself so I don’t have to come into contact with anyone just to keep my little girl alive. So please people before posting jokes and silly comments please think about who might see or read it, as some of us are living in this nightmare and are going to find these months extremely dficult. In another Facebook post she wrote: Both myself and Wayne are utterly heartbroken yet again that we are in a position where we may lose our little girlshe doesnapost carry on fighting. Please, please, please keep Erin in your prayers. We canapost lose her over this virus. She has battled through too much – we need her, she completes us.  I hope that those who havenapost taken this virus serious read this and I hope it now sinks in. Mr Bates said that when Erin was born, he and his we had been told they might not be able to have children so were aposover the moonapos after trying to start a family for  years. But their daughteraposs first six months have been an emotional rollercoaster as she was diagnosed with a catalogue of medical conditions including a heart condition that meant she had open heart surgery in December. In January, she also suffered a respiratory virus, which causes a potentially fatal bout of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies. Erin also suffered tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia which affected her her windpipe and its branches into the lungs, and already required use of the CPAP machine. She is currently in a stable condition and her parents have thanked the dedicated NHS workers at the hospital. The family have received messages of support from well-wishers on Facebook.  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live pandemic uk updates","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE updates: UK lockdown facing week  review as China fears second waveThe UKs lockdown is entering its fourth week today and the future of restrictions of people will be reviewed by ministers in the coming days as hundreds continue to die every day with coronavirusShareByAbigail OLearyUpdated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-makes-first-statement-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

His worried we Gerry cared for him at their home after the retired microbiologist refused to take him to hospital. She hasnapost caught the deadly virus but recorded the full experience for them both in a diary which was originally written for a Covid- Cheltenham page on Facebook.Paul, , told Gloucestershire Live : “It was like being hit by a train. You lose all your energy. You’re burning up all the time.“You just have to fight your way through it. Mentally, there were times when I was very low.” Paul has lost a stone and a half in weight since first developing symptoms of the disease on March . He added: “Generally speaking, I’m feeling pretty good. But I go for a walk every afternoon and after about  minutes, I get breathless.“I’m still a long way from being back to the level I was at. I think it will be another two weeks, at least.    Paul’s Covid- story, through Gerry’s diary Just want to say my husband, who is , fit and healthy caught the virus in Derby when he was on contract work. I am , asthmatic, and high risk, so what a dilemma, me looking after him. Day  : Paul came home from work yesterday. At first the symptoms were mild, no cough more like a cold, and we both thought that’s good, but I think I had better sleep in the spare bedroom just in case. At this point I should tell you I am an ex microbiologist, albeit many years ago, I have also worked in a cardiac unit, and then went into digital medical imaging for a couple of companies, training doctors in telemedicine and PACS which was new to the NHS then.Day  : He worked at home, eating normally and drinking wine with a meal, his temperature was slightly rising, but he said he didn’t feel that bad, slept well.Day  : Woke up and said he was feeling much better, so worked from home again, we ate a good lunch and I thought Ok mild symptoms just like they said. That night on the sofa he said I don’t feel good, then WHAM, he said it was like being hit with a hot wrecking ball. He went up to bed about pm, he looked bad, red eyed, ruddy face, shivering but hot and clammy, didn’t want any supper. Unlike Paul as he loved his food. Day  : Now in bed all the time, temperature rising from .- , he says he feels awful, he looks awful, I am not too worried at the moment, as I had had Hong Kong flu in  and know what a virus can do to your body, plus several chest infects and pneumonia twice, and as an asthmatic, I cannot get this new virus. Paul needs me as well.I keep the fluids going for him by filling water jugs and trying to get him to drink, not easy when all he wants to do is sleep. In my head I set about a new cleaning regime, even though I had adhered to government advice and washed hands, and wiped down surfaces with antibac wipes, I was going to go even further. I am symptomless at the moment. Day  : Still no cough, but very high temperatures, complete exhaustion, loss of appetite, tired was not the word, it was assleep had overcome him. But we only have one bathroom, which proved dficult.Food was not too much of a problem as he only ate two Weetabix a day, but getting him to drink and take paracetamol was not easy with a person who only wanted to sleep. I am his carer now and I am determined to get him better and not to go into hospital. Would he ever come out Day  : I am not getting much sleep as now as I am beginning to worry, we are being told by the government symptoms are mild and after  days of isolation you can go out. WHAT we are on day  and he just about can get out of bed to go to the toilet.BANG his temperature went up above . Paracetamol every  hours is not having much effect. I keep telling him to drink, and sit up as I know this virus attacks your lungs so completely lying down is no good, but he yells at me he just wants to sleep, I am in despair. Neighbours are supplying us with food basics, and I have to stay in as I am high risk, that is a joke, he was fit and healthy, he has it I don’t yet, still no symptoms for me. Day  : Cough intermittent. Now, temperature -  not eaten anything today, that’s ok he was overweight, so not worried about that. Loss of taste, and smell, tea he said tasted like sick, he doesn’t want tea now, or coffee. Wow this is a very dferent virus. His eyes sore and red and looks dreadful, ruddy face get ruddier and clearly very very unwell. Still won’t sit up.This is a game changer, I must get him to drink as I notice his urine is quite dark, I am feeling isolated, which is what I am, but isolated with a sick man who is my husband. I need a drink, I open up some prosecco from the fridge, oh Paul normally does the cork bit, never mind I can do that.  Those  glasses were great. My only outing has been walking my dog Dylan, which is like winning the lottery every time I go out, walking, aside whenever I see someone  walk by, chats from a distance, not many people these days, and no cars. So dferent to last week when the Cheltenham festival was on, Southam Lane was packed full of cars, and you can see the racecourse screens from my bedroom window, and hear the loud speakers, everything is quiet there now, only the birds singing. Oh was that a plane I can see in the sky  Day   : Pretty much the same as yesterday. High temperature, very high still, ruddy face, chills but hot, loss of taste and smell more pronounced as the Weetabix needed more sugar on it, although I had put some, no loads, on it.He hadn’t been speaking to me much except to ask for water, or orange juice or his Weetabix, I noticed he hadn’t been using his phone for a few days, so unlike Paul as his phone was an extension of his right arm, he is sinking into depression I thought, he had been depressed before, he said the darkness overtook him, and was on Prozac for  months, is that happening now  He was also angry, angry with me and himself. He told me he didn’t know why he couldn’t control the virus, why was he not getting any better  What can I do to make him better  Yes Paul is a bit of a control freak, but he says so am I. I asked him to sit up. I can’t he says, it’s not comfortable, I want to sleep now. So I go out of the room and watch the news. Yes I had been avidly watching the daily briefings, depressing, hope gone out for many, lockdown a new word, more deaths in Italy, oh those pictures in the Italian hospital made me think this could happen here. Then there was the government still saying most will get it mild, for  days. So in my head I am thinking you either get mild symptoms for  days or die. Death was everywhere, headlines. This deadly virus, how many had died today, how many had caught it, was there nothing in between mild and death  Then when I told my friends Paul was very ill, I suspected it was Covid-, most said ‘So sorry, poor you.’ It was just like being back in the ’s when someone told someone  they had Aids, it was a death sentence. So Covid- was a death sentenceyou didn’t get it mild, and although most deaths were those with underlying conditions, mostly elderly, the media were now highlighting fit and healthy young people had died. Day  : It was about pm and his temperature climbed to over , and said he could not take a deep breath and when I looked at him I could see fear in eyes, that is when I phoned , yes it took ages to get through, but I hung on, describing symptoms,  nswering their questions, they said yes, it probably was Covid, but was then told a doctor would be calling.Doctor called back and was . per cent sure it was Covid, he said he was not worried about the high temperature, as that was his body fighting this awful virus, but he did tell Paul, you will get over this, you are fit. Advice was sit up in bed, move aroundyou can, drink as much as you can, and get better. If you need more help you can phone your surgery. That was enough for him to let go of the fear in his head. Day  : Paul is still very ill, temperature still high, and so so weak, he could hardly stand, but he wanted clean sheets on his bed. My microbiology brain came zooming in, ‘Paul you will have to take them downstairs yourself and put them in the washing machine.’ He didn’t know how to change the temperature so I did that, they got washed at  degrees, then hung out on the line.Goodbye you horrible coronaviruses on my sheets. The new sheets I could do, and he was happy now the feel of , thread count fresh cotton sheets would make anyone feel better. Although sitting up more it was in short periods, and every time I asked him to sit up, he said aposstop nagging meapos, Was he getting better  Not sure as he was still sleeping loads. Day  : Neighbours still bringing supplies to my doorstep, I had three separate neighbours bring me ious basics. How weird! but wonderful, what great neighbours I have. Paul had suddenly asked for orange juice, so that was delivered to our doorstep along with some bread, eggs and milk, and oh yes some choccy biscuits ,and I have managed to get our local dairies to deliver Milk and other dairy products next week, that will be so good. I also ordered some Wine from MS, havenapost had red wine now for a week, only the Proseco left over from the Panto in January, The Wizard of Gloz. Thinking I could do with a wizard now to magic this bloody virus to hell. Anyway my red wine should have been delivered by now, where on earth is it  Still can’t get a food delivery slot, have been trying now for ages. Today I also stopped watching and listening to the news, just going to listen to the daily broadcast on Sky by the PM and the chief medical officer. I am big radio fan , Radio  live and Radio , but so many opposition politicians blaming the government for this, just would like to know what they would have done dferent, damn those politicians. Just Radio  now, Rylan on Saturday was so funny with his best ever worst jokes, I was laughing so much I almost forgot I had a sick husband upstairs. I am also a quilter, so making a spiderman quilt for my  year old grandson was a great distraction as well. Who would have thought Spiderman and Rylan would be so comforting on a sunny Saturday. Isolation, not good. Paul’s temperature now , and I have been running up and downstairs so often now, I am feeling quite fit for a -year-old at high risk. Now pm, Paul sleeping, I can have some me time downstairs with some more Prosecco, Dylan on the sofa as normal fast asleep, I normally don’t go to bed till after , so I watched Ghosts on catchup. Hilarious, made me laugh so much, but weird thinking a programme about dead people would make me feel happy with laughter. Time for bed. I stand beside his bed, bedside cabinets strewn with empty paracetamol packets, thermometer, two empty glasses, a jug half empty, I wonder how many virus bits are on those. I quietly put them in a bag and take the downstairs to the dishwasher, I then scrub my hands for  seconds in hot water. Today I washed his towels at  degrees. Back up stairs to hopefully sleep undisturbed. Tonight was the first night I felt I wouldn’t keep looking in on him to seehe was ok, a bit like a sick child. Day  : He is much better today, temperature virtually down to normal, but very very weak. Eating more but we both can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have so many great comments from the Facebook page it has been so comforting, that so many others are going through the same thing, and that we are all scared, all in the same boat with this virus swimming alongside us.I am pleased I can help some, and advise where possible, over , likes and comments now. Similar symptoms, especially the taste and smell thing, I am so pleased I did this, I just hope it will have a happy ending. I just want to thank those neighbours who have helped with shopping,you are reading this, thanks Ruth, Matt and Steph, and Robbie. I hope this diary will give hope to those in despair that they think they will not get better, as most of us will, and this virus, as I have just heard the PM has it, doesnapost care who it settles on. So everyone stay safe and be positive, as I have seen at first hand the mental side of this is just as damaging as the physical side of this disease.  Day  : Thank you all for your kind words during this dficult time, just for those who don’t know.I started writing this as the government are saying most have mild symptoms, and after  days you can stop self isolating, as Boris and Mat said yesterday, the other extreme seemed to be death. As this is our personal case and yesterday we were in day , there did not seem to be anything in between, so I diarised Paul Covid- illness. Most of you know me as the script writer of our amdram pantos, the last one being the Wizard of Gloz at Prestbury Hall in January in aid of James Hopkins Trust in Gloucester, and also to give the villages of Prestbury, Woodmancote and Southam some fun and laughter, so I have had to resist saying Oh no he isn’t and He’s behind you in this diary. Many of you have asked how I am feeling. So how am I feeling  Lonely at times, exhausted running up and down stairs with drinks and food, but blessed I have some great and wonderful neighbours. It is almost like looking after a very obstreperous sick child. But most of all worried, about Paul, and about whether he is still infectious, the government say  days and  daysboth are infected. As an ex microbiologist, my scientic brain wants to know these answers, and why some of the symptoms we are all experiencing are not included in the info. Paul did eat better, but still wants to sleep flat, against doctor’s advice, so this morning he told me he went down stairs as he felt he could not get enough oxygen in his lungs, so sat on the sofa. He also opened a large brown packet that he thought was a new cereal, only to find that with milk it tasted awful - no wonder, it was dried yeast flakes for bread making. This morning still lying down in bed complaining he couldn’t breathe, which is worrying, but obviously part of the disease, but telling him to sit up was frustrating. So I asked him to explain more. How it felt, he said, was that he felt stuffed in his lungs, which is how I sometimes feel being an asthmatic. So I have a nebuliser at home, with some Ventolin solution and saline solution for use with the nebuliser. Although not an asthmatic, I did give him the Ventolin on the nebuliser. I have to stress this was NOT done on medical advice, but my own personal advice. Afterwards he said he felt his airways had opened, which is exactly what nebulised Ventolin does. I will probably get into medical trouble for telling you this, but I was onl  going on his symptoms, which as an ex microbiologist we used to in the s and s, no modelling graphs then. Oh I must stop saying what I think.  I also have one of those little pressure metal inhalers, and a salt pipe for use when I am bad, with asthma, which I have given him. Stuffed lungs or not stuffed lungs, seems to me I made the correct choice,not medical decision. His temperature remains about ., which is better than . It is now about .pm. I have showered got dressed and put my makeup on, can’t be seen without my brows done, mascara on and lipstick, you never know who is going to see you through the front door window. Many of you have asked how I have kept symptom free. Seeing bacteria under the microscope and in poo, sick urine e.t.c. I have always loved bleach in the bathroom, and have at least two bottles handy near the loo, Paul doesn’t seem to know they exist, and as a man always leaves the loo seat up. So I have torn some paper up and use this to close it, I am spraying it with mould destroyer regularly, contains bleach, as I would like to keep my antibacterial wipes for door handles, and bleach for inside the loo. I may go over the top on some things, butI take his plates and cups downstairs, I put them in a bag, with my latex gloves on, then straight into the dishwasher. Clothes bedsheets, I have asked him to put in the washing machine and put the soap capsule in, he didnapost know how to use the increased temperature button, so I do that and wash sheets and towels at  degrees and his clothes at  degrees, toughthey shrink. I wipe down all door handles and taps at night before bed and I have bought some sterilising tablets from amazon to keep his toothbrush free of germs. Our electric toothbrush is moow just his, as he has to handle it regularly I use my travel toothbrush. I am not a doctor remember, but I do expect some medical professional to have a go at me for giving him the Ventolin, but I don’t care, it worked for him and he is my husband. It is now nearly pm, and Paul says although weak still does feel better. Day  ½ over. I do wish Boris our PM, Matt Hancock and Chris, the chief medical officer a speedy recovery and do hope their mild symptoms don’t get any worse as in what we have experienced here.

The health body says some of the patients aposmay have Covid-, whether symptomatic or asymptomaticapos, when they are transferred from hospitals to care homes.Despite not guaranteeing that all such patients will be tested, all apospatients can be safely care for in a care homeguidance is followapos, the health body claims in a briefing document. Rachel Beckett, of York based care home chain Wellburn, has spoken out against the instructions, which states that negative coronavirus tests are not required prior to patientsapos transfer into care homes. She said PHE was instructing care homes to open up their general admissions to other hospitalised patients, who also may or may not have the disease.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirrorShe said: The instruction from PHE also goes on to say that, aposbecause of the lack of testing available, the readmissions may or may not have Covid-apos. Iaposm absolutely sure youaposd be hard pressed to find one care home provider in the UK, that feels comfortable with this outrageous and reckless request. I have a duty of care to my residents, to their loved ones and my staff. How can I with good conscience admit any patient back into any of our homes, when we have no ideathey have Covid- or not  Our staff levels are woefully depleted, and the staff we do have left, although remaining resilient and in good spirits, are shattered, overworked and pushed to the limit as is.  Rachel outlined the level of risk she considered the PHE instructions to pose. To expect us to comply with these instructions is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with the lives of our most vulnerable, the very people weaposre here to keep safe and protect, she said. Thataposs something Iaposm just not prepared to do. I canapost look my residents, my staff and all of their families and loved ones in the eyes and say weaposre doing everything we can to protect each and every one of them, whilst opening up our doors, hoping and praying that a patient isnapost carrying a virus in with them. Her comments were echoed by the Alzheimeraposs Society, which has called on the Government to provide more testing and Personal Protective Equipment for care homes.  Its intervention comes amid concerns that residents with dementia are being abandoned and that social care has yet again fallen to the bottom of the pile. A spokeswoman for PHE said hospitals around the country needed as many beds as possible to support and treat an increasing number of Covid- cases.

The -year-old realised that he had forgotten his wallet when she saw him patting his pockets, Leicestershire Live reported. Ky, a nursery nurse, walked over after hearing Joe explain how he left his wallet at home to the cashier, and offered to pay for him. Do you know a coronavirus hero  Get in touch with your story at  webnews@mirror Joe, who repaid the cash a short time later, was incredibly touched by her random act of kindness. He wrote: Queuing outside in the sunshine, it was great to see the Sainsbury’s team working away calmly and professionally, but sharing a laugh with the queuing customers, too. I was shopping for my parents and my uncle as well as for my own family, so ended up spending over an hour inside searching the shelves for unfamiliar products, only to find that – once I’d run everything through checkout – I’d left my wallet at home. A young lady who had just finished at the next checkout immediately offered to pay for me – well over £ – despite not knowing me from Adam. Not only that, she then waited around, with her young child, while I ran my parents’ and my uncle’s shopping through, too, and paid for that as well.  Thank you Sainsbury’s staff for keeping calm and carrying on, but more than anything, thank you Ky F for showing how wonderful people can be when the chips are down. Ky was tracked down and approached by Leicestershire Live. Currently furloughed from work, she said she had been shopping with her daughter, five-year-old Bella, when she spotted Joe and realised he was in a pickle. She said: I was at the self-service checkout and he was just a short distance away. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK.

The camper from Hull travelled  miles to North Wales before he was approached by a -year-old local. The man then brandished a stick after he had been told to leave. The video was posted on social media after the camper was confronted by a group of locals who asked him to leave the site at Llyn Cowlyd near Trefriw on Saturday, Hull Live reports. Locals spotted two campers at the site, with one claiming to be from Hull, and asked them to leave after reminding them of the rules of the lockdown.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here He stopped inches away from hitting the man before walking back to his tent and tossing the stick to the ground. The daughter of the -year-old in the footage told  North Wales Live : My dad was with the owner of the land and all they did was ask them to leave and said that the police were on their way. Then the man threatened to hit my dad in the head with the stick. She added: When the police arrived, the campers said they were from Hull. The officers were mortied.  They were fined and they traced the number plate to make sure they ed home. Her dad added: It was unbelievable that they travelled all the way from Hull to the top of a mountain to camp when the whole country is on lockdown and the government clearly has instructed everyone to stay home unless necessary. They were asked to move the night before and were told they weren’t supposed to be there, but they decided to ignore that and the police had been informed. The police arrived the following morning and dealt with the situation.  The manaposs daughter also posted a follow-up tweet showing the mess she claimed the campers made before they were moved on by police. The picture shows rubbish strewn across the site including bottles of Coke and water, tin foil, toilet roll and a burning fire. She tweeted: “Also this is the mess they left on our neighbouraposs land. Absolute disgrace. “The police did eventually arrive and dealt with the matter, him and his mate will hopefully think twice before leaving their house again.”  The video has had more than , views on Twitter and has been shared almost , times.

Since the virus began edging its way towards the UK public health officials have warned that new, persistent coughs and fevers are tell-tale signs of the disease. As more and more people have been struck down by Covid-, a fuller list of symptoms has emerged. One of the more curious ones is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos sensation. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@trinitymirror   Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.”Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system.“Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Dr Vipul Shah, Clinical Director at telehealth service Pack Health, suggested it may simply be people experiencing a fever for the first time.Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus. However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Isla Haslam, , from Balham, South West London, experienced stomach problems while suffering with the coronavirus. She realised that what she first thought was the consequences of a lentil heavy dinner was in fact coronavirus when she began to feel feverish. The third, slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain.Researchers from  Hard Medical School filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his  testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs.Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-.  Unfortunately, because the man had atypical symptoms, several other patients and doctors may have unknowingly been exposed to the virus. While it remains unclear whether or not his testicular pain was linked to the virus, other viruses have been known to affect the testicles. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for seven days. You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild.Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others as it can take  days for them to appear. DO NOT go to your GP or hospital. Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice. Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital. Speaking to  MailOnline, Dr Viney, a surgeon in Birmingham, said: “There are certain viruses that can affect the testicles, such as mumps.“Only time will tellCOVID- also affects the testicles but it isn’t a symptom many of the patients I’ve dealt with have complained about. For most of them, their testicles are the least of their worries.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast temperatures nosedive","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Temperatures to nosee across Britain after C Easter heatwaveParts of the UK will struggle to reach double figures as the C highs over Easter drop away and the cold breeze kicks in, though it will remain sunny and dry for most, say forecastersShareCommentsBySiba JacksonRyan Merrield:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video bank-holiday-monday-weather-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-weather-forecast-temperatures-nosee-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Rachel Brummert has an underlying health condition that makes her extremely vulnerable to the virus, so she listened to the advice of medical experts and shielded at home. She thought she was doing everything right, yet she tested positive for the new strain - which has now infected about two million people - last Thursday.

Out come the burgers, hot dogs, sausages, chicken legs, fish and tasty char-grilled veg, all cooked in the sunshine. Most homes have a designated BBQ chef, who has their own special way of cooking outside - but Gordon Ramsay says theyaposre doing it all wrong. And since he owns a burger restaurant in Las Vegas he obviously knows what heaposs talking about. In a video viewed more than million times, Gordon explains not only how to make the perfect patty but all of the most common mistakes we make and how to avoid them. Gordon said: This is one of my most desired burgers, one of my favourite burgers and then goes on to mention that this burger is on sale at his burger restaurant in Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas, and is known as the F-Word burger. Use dferent meats Gordon explains that the secret behind a perfect burger is a mixture of dferent quality meats. He uses chuck, as well as ground beef and brisket. Preparation is key Gordon generously seasons the meat with salt and pepper and binds it altogether using a touch of egg. He says you canapost season the burgers after theyaposre cooked so he makes sure to roll the seasoning around the edge of the burger too. But says this should be done the day beforepossible, then you need to set them in the fridge so they stay nice and firm and donapost fall apart on the grill. And when it comes to cooking the bruegrs, donapost put them straight onto the heat from the fridge because then theyaposll be dry on the outside and raw in the middle. Drizzle a little olive oil onto them too - he uses grapeseed oil.  Put the BBQ lid down When you place the burgers onto the grill it should be piping hot and you should place them onto the hottest part - which is usually two thirds of the way up. When youaposve placed the burgers on the grill Gordon explains: The secret is to move it as less as possible. The more you move it, the more chance youaposve got of breaking the burger. Make sure to put the BBQ lid down once your burgers are in as this incorporates the heat, and gets a great sear on the bottom, so when we come to turn those burgers they donapost stick. How many times have you stuck burgers on the grill and wondered why itaposs sticking  Nicely oiled, quick sear and put that lid down - itaposs really important.  Toasting the buns Once the burgers are cooking the next step is to toast the buns. Gordon says We toast the buns because thereaposs nothing worse than a soggy bun. Toasting the bun makes them nice and crisp, and it protects the burger. He seasons the buns with salt, pepper and a drizzle of oil, before putting them on the grill and closing the lid again. And even toasts the tops of the bun too.  Get set up Gordon ensures that the rest of his ingredients are prepped, ready for when the burgers are cooked - they only take three to four minutes each side to cook completely.

Adding butter Approximately two minutes before the burgers are ready to come off, Gordon adds butter. Gordon says: “Now at my burger restaurant in Las Vegas, we baste the burgers with Devonshire butter. “Today, we’re going to lightly brush a bit of butter onto the burgers. “With that flame underneath, it caramelises the butter and puts this wonderful flavour on top. “It makes the burgers so tasty.” He also suggests making a red-wine butter or a chipotle butteryou want to be even more chefy. And lightly season them again with salt and pepper.

Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. It is now being used around the globe in a race against time to find a cure and vaccine for the deadly bug, which has already infected more than .million people around the world and caused , deaths. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. But when the virologist received the fateful call on December  last year, just after the first patient samples had arrived at the lab in Wuhan, she admits she knew she would be about the battle her worst nightmare. And Zhengli had one overriding fear - had the new virus been accidentally unleashed by the lab she worked in. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Zhengli was at a conference outside Wuhan when she received the terrying phonecall that would change the course of the world. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan. Zhengli and her team worked round the clock to find the genetic code of this new strain of coronavirus as the Covid- spread around the world like wildfire. But it was a moment she had spent her entire career working towards - starting with her first virus expedition back in . Zhengli travelled to bat colonies located in caves near Nanning, which she described as spellbinding. But the work was hard, with long hikes and risky decents into caves to find the creatures - and could often be frustrating. She was part of the team who were searching for the source of the SARS epidemic after a team from Hong Kong had reported that civets, which are similar to mongoose, had been the source of the virus and they were found in the subtropical parts of Asia and Africa. Before SARS the world had been blissfully unaware of the devastating impact of the coronavirus family but the epidemic led to a global push to both learn more and work to prevent a pandemic - and Zhengli was part of that early team. And the one thing that seemed to be key in the outbreak of a coronavirus was that they had started in bats before spreading to other animals and then humans. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. At the end of their patience, the team were about tohome when another lab gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code. After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. Horryingly, the team discovered hundreds of strains of coronaviruses but thankfully just dozens were similar to SARS, could infect human lungs and were immune to vaccines and cures that had proved successful against other forms of the virus. And finally, in one cave, the scientists found what seemed to be the epicentre for SARS - but this came with an added risk. It meant millions of bats were mixing and creating increasing opportunities for the virus to evolve and for new strains to emerge. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And this was not the only time Zhengli and her team had found evidence bats were spreading a new strain of the deadly virus. Six miners had been struck down with an illness similar to SARS and when Zhengli investigated the mineshaft where they were working, they discovered it was covered in a disgusting-smelling fungus. The mine was closed immediately to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Zhengli fears that the more humans move into areas previously havens for wildle, the greater the risk of unleashing new coronaviruses on the population. This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic - something Zhengli has long feared. A year ago, Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Then, at the turn of the year, everything they had been preparing for for the last  years suddenly needed to kick into action. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. Zhengli admits she didnapost sleep at all during those first few days of frantic testing and a week after the first case had been reported she was certain a new strain of coronavirus has caused the sickness that had killed the patients - and Covid- was born. Chillingly, it also showed there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They also found the virus could have been in existance for months but hadnapost started to spread until it reached Wuhan - and its wildle markets where animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion, however, Zhengli believes the consumption and trade of wildle is not the whole problem. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves.Le is Wuhan is slowly ing to normal, although China has recorded its highest number of daily new  coronavirus  cases in almost six weeks, sparking fears of a second wave of Covid- after restrictions were eased.A total of  new coronavirus cases were reported in mainland China on Sunday, up from  a day earlier and marking the highest number of cases since  infections were reported on March . But for two months Zhengli barely left her lab and survived on nothing but instant noodles as she and her team worked to not only identy the virus but come up with the key to a cure. The found how it gets into human lungs and are now working on drugs that can block it, as well as trying to come up with a vaccine and trial it on people. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

A total of  Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive. Our little town here, we thought it was the safest place, said a resident of the border city of Suenhe, who only gave his surname as Zhu. Some Chinese citizens they want to come back, but itaposs not very sensible, what are you doing coming here for   Though the number of daily infections across China have dropped sharply from the height of the epidemic in February, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening border controls and imposing stricter quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.  Suenhe last week announced restrictions on movements and gatherings similar to those imposed in Wuhan city, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged late last year, and extended the closure of its border with Russia. The land route through the city had become one of few options available for Chinese nationals trying to get into China after Russia stopped all flights to the country.  Suenhe and Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, are now mandating  days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad as well as nucleic acid and antibody tests. Streets in Suenhe were virtually empty on Sunday evening due to restrictions of movement. Residents said a lot of people had left the city as the number of infected people crossing the border from Russia rose. I donapost need to worry, Zhao Wei, another Suenhe resident, told Reuters. If thereaposs a local transmission, I would, but thereaposs not a single one. Theyaposre all from the border, but theyaposve all been sent to quarantine. In Shanghai, authorities found that  people who arrived on Aeroflot flight SU from Moscow on April  have the coronavirus, Zheng Jin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told a press conference on Monday.  China has cut the number of people crossing its borders by  per cent and has tried to stop all non-essential journeys, said Liu Haitao, an immigration official, at a separate briefing on Monday. Our border is long, and apart from the border crossings and passages, there are a large number of mountain passes, paths, ferry crossings and small roads, and the situation is very complicated, he said. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Center for Diseases Prevention and Control in Beijing, said the trend for local transmission of the disease in the capital was low. Imported cases are still the highest risk in Beijing in the second half of April, Pang said, adding that nearly eight per cent of the , nucleic acid tests carried out in the city since April  had been conducted on people who had come from abroad. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at , as of Sunday.  At the peak of the first wave of the epidemic on February  there were over , new cases. Though the number of daily infections across China has dropped sharply from that peak, China has seen the daily toll creep higher after hitting a trough on March  because of the rise in imported cases. China has been accused of underreporting its total number of infections. China hid work of Bat Woman scientist China is accused of hiding the findings of a coronavirus expert - known as Bat Woman - after she quickly identied the genetic make-up of the new strain that has infected millions. Wuhan-based virologist Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS.  It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan. But she was muzzled and her team was ordered not to reveal any information about the new disease, which was already spreading rapidly as China kept the world in the dark. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections. Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported. The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. The day that the genetic information was mapped, Yanyi Wang, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ordered staff not to reveal any information about the disease, it is claimed. After local doctors were detained for warning locals about the virus, the director claimed inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing general panic.  She ordered staff not to post any information on social media or speak to the media. Just over a week later, a team in Shanghai published a sequence on an open access  after studying samples from an infected patient. Their laboratory was shut for rectication two days later. One of the earliest Covid- cases emerged in mid-December when a patient, who worked at a wildle market in Wuhan that became the early epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised with a double lung infection in the city in central China. The usual treatment for flu-like illness failed to work and new cases soon emerged. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need. Our Mirror Coronavirus Heroes series wants to recognise all of those helping the most vulnerable during the crisis.

Three days later, at least two doctors from Wuhan - Li Wenliang and Ai Fen - shared information about the new virus on the social network WeChat. Li, a whistleblower who was warned by police to stop making  comments, died in February after contracting the virus. Ai is missing after giving media interviews criticising Chinaaposs censorship and hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak. She told the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, that she was reprimanded after alerting her bosses and colleagues of the new virus in December.  On  December, she received the laboratory results of one case which stated: SARS coronavirus. The next day, Wuhan officials confirmed almost  cases, shut down the wildle market and notied the World Health Organisationaposs local office about the mysterious illness. New cases continued to emerge and the outbreak was spreading outside of China, but for a week in January health officials in Wuhan insisted they had not received any new patients. During that time, the first known case outside of China was detected in Thailand and a case was reported in the US as infected people left Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to travel across the country and around the world. Chinese authorities insisted they hadnapost seen any clear evidence that the virus could be spread from human to human.  By then they had lost control and hospitals were becoming overwhelmed by the rising number of infected patients. Within days Dr Zhong Nanshan, the countryaposs top respiratory expert and the face of its containment effort, revealed that human transmission was taking place. Wuhan and several other cities struggling to contain the virus went into lockdown on January , days before the Lunar New Year holiday, but by then millions of people had left without being screened. That day, Shi Zhengli and her research team published their data identying the illness on a scientic portal before it was published in February by the medical journal Nature. In the weeks that followed the lockdown in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread to and within other countries due to imported cases and community transmission.  China is still censoring academic research into the origins of the new strain of coronavirus. The authorities have placed new restrictions on the publication of research that could shed new light on how it was passed from an animal to a human. All academic papers are being given extra vetting before being submitted for publication, it emerged on Monday. Studies must be approved by the central government before they are shared with the rest of the world, according to since-deleted online posts by two Chinese universities. A researcher told CNN that the new restrictions were another attempt by China to cover up its failures and would likely disrupt important scientic research. The researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation, added: I think it is a coordinated effort fromChinese government to controlnarrative, and paint it asthe outbreak did not originate in China. And I donapost think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease. PPE bound for UK held up by red tape Meanwhile, personal protective equipmentis being sent from China to the UK amid shortages at healthcare facilities in Britain and the deaths of almost  NHS workers. However, much of the kit from China is unusable because it fails UK safety checks.  Some shipments are being held up by red tape in China, the worldaposs biggest supplier of PPE, and some are wrongly labelled and do not contain the right gear, it has emerged. For example, a crate is labelled gowns but it contains masks instead. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast there were concerns about a shortage of PPE in some hospitals. Stocks of gowns have run critically low, he added. Mr Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was hand-to-mouth.

The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point. We all worked brilliantly together and did each other favours. We still all keep in contact two of them are still at the university.#In  Muriel made the decision to retire, but only managed  weeks before ing to work # this time in a dferent role. She#d passed a remark to a colleague, around six months prior to her retirement, about an ambition to work on the university reception at one stage.#And then, after I was away for  weeks, I got a phone call one morning and he said to me #you once said that you would like to work in the reception. Well, we#re looking for someone now.# ##When can I start # I replied. He said to me, #I think you need to discuss that with your husband# and I said #oh there#ll be no discussion,# she tells me, laughing hysterically.I ask her why she retired in the first place. #I think I just needed a break,# she says.#They were wanting to expand things and change things and they probably felt #well that old soul won#t change.# I felt it was maybe time to hang up the reins and let someone  have an opportunity.# Now, Muriel works part-time from Monday to Friday and loves every second of it. #It#s good to meet people and I think that when you#re older, you need something like this,# she says.#This sitting around the house would drive me mad.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp

finished rehab on my knee and wasn’t even sure I’d be able to play on anyway.Thankfully, Dundee United gave me a chance, though the uncertainty continued even so.I wasn’t sure my knee would hold up and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual

launches initiative to provide recycled bikes to key workers","story":"A Perth charity has launched an initiative to provide recycled bikes to key workers in the area to enable them to travel to and from work safely and with minimum contact with others.The Bike Station launched the scheme on Friday in the hope it will help Perth and Edinburgh key workers get around safely.The charity repairs unwanted bikes and puts them back on the road, as well as providing cycle training and bike maintenance information.Anyone who is a key worker can now apply for a free recycled bike to help them travel safely, avoid public transport and relax at the end of each sht.Sasha Taylor, chief executive of The Bike Station, said: “Now more than ever our key workers need our support.“We know bikes can help, by providing access to safe and affordable independent transport and just as importantly, a means to look after their own health and wellbeing.“We’ve launched Hero Bikes to support our key workers who are giving their all to protect our communities.”Erin Tindal, a care home worker in Perth, was the first key worker to receive one of the Hero Bikes.Erin originally borrowed her bike through a Social Cycle Project loan and she will now own it outright as a Hero Bike.Using the Hero Bike more than halves her journey time to work on foot.Erin said: “It was really mostly out of necessity that I wanted to cycle.“I didn’t think I’d love it as much as I do – it’s amazing.“I’ve been cycling in all weathers as well which has been fab.”To be eligible, workers need to provide proof of their role and be aged  or over.Priority will be given to residents of the two cities served by The Bike Station’s shops in Perth and Edinburgh.Fundraising is ongoing to expand the scheme to support as many key workers as possible.Anyone can donate to fund accessory packs for key workers and spare parts needed to refurbish second-hand bikes on The Bike Station’s website.People can support

the most senior figures in the Labour party have renewed pleas for Aberdeen’s nine suspended councillors to be re-admitted to the party.Jackie Baillie MSP and Ian Murray MP called for the councillors to be reinstated as part of their respective campaigns for deputy leader of Scottish Labour.Ms Baillie was elected to the role, while Mr Murray has since been appointed shadow Scottish secretary.The entire Labour group on Aberdeen City Council were suspended from the party after entering the administration with the Conservative and Independent Alliance groups following the  local elections.However, with the third anniversary of their suspension approaching next month, the party has come under increasing pressure to resolve the issue and bring the councillors back into the fold.Mr Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, said: “It is farcical that this has dragged on for nearly three years.“I was clear during my deputy leadership campaign that I believe the councillors should all be re-admitted to the party, and I stand by that.“Despite being decimated by cuts, the administration has an anti-poverty strategy, has invested heavily in capital infrastructure projects and housing, spends more than the national average on education, and there have been no compulsory redundancies.“I will be raising this with the party and requesting a speedy resolution.”Ms Baillie, Dumbarton MSP, added: “I have always been very clear that I believe the ‘Aberdeen Nine’ should be reinstated as Scottish Labour councillors.“The work that the group carries out has improved the lives of people in Aberdeen, demonstrates their Labour values and has benefited the city as a whole.“This suspension has gone on for too long and I will use my position as Scottish Labour deputy leader to bring this to a conclusion.”Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing – one of those suspended – welcomed the pair’s comments.She said: “I am delighted that Ian Murray and Jackie Baillie are back at the forefront of Scottish Labour politics because they, more than anyone, know how to win elections.“It is important that after almost three years of suspension, Richard Leonard listens to Ian Murray and Jackie Baillie who have both campaigned to get the Aberdeen Labour Nine reinstated.”Fellow councillor Sandra Macdonald added: “We warmly welcome the backing of senior party colleagues like Jackie Baillie and Ian Murray.“They will help lead a revived and reinvigorated Labour Party in the period that lies ahead, and Aberdeen Labour councillors very much look forward to being part of that.”Scottish Labour was contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.47569501-240x180.jpg

He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She looked up and saw smoke, then noticed all the animals running from a fire that had broken out amidst the heather.The squirrel rushed down the tree and also began to run.But she did not run out the forest like the other animals, instead she stopped at a river. She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water. As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option. But the wild cat lived in the forest too, and without it her habitat would be gone.ldquoI wouldI could, said the wild cat, ldquobut the thing is, I am afraid of water.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the hare, ldquobut we are also afraid of you, but we will be brave and work with you to save the forest.The wild cat thought for a moment. ldquoVery well I will be brave too she said, ldquoI will do what I can do.So the squirrel, the hare and the wild cat all ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her busy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, while the wild cat took a deep breath and bravely jumped in and quickly out of the water soaking her coat.They ed to the fire, and all three stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made little dference.Just then, a golden eagle was flying above and saw the squirrel, hare and wild cat.ldquoWell thatrsquos something Irsquove never seen before, said the golden eagle to herself, ldquoa squirrel, a hare and a wild cat working together. I have to find out whatrsquos going on.So the golden eagle flew down and watched what they were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the golden eagle, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the three of you.The wild cat looked at the golden eagle and nodded.ldquoWe know she said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the golden eagle and asked him, ldquoWill you help us The eagle had wide wings, and although he lived in the forest he could easily fly away and find another forest.But this was his home too no other forest had the memories this one had.ldquoI would like to help, said the golden eagle, ldquobut the thing is I have no bushy tail, no long ears nor a coat of fur.ldquoHmm, thatrsquos true, said the wild cat, but you do have many feathers.The eagle thought for a moment.ldquoSo I do, he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so this time the squirrel, the hare and the wild cat ran to the river, while the golden eagle flew above.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, while the wild cat took a deep breath and bravely jumped in and quickly out of the water soaking her coat.Then the golden eagle swooped down and collected water in his feathers.They ed to the fire, and all four stood a safe distance away.The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body, while the golden eagle ruffled his feathers above the flames.They all sprayed the fire with droplets of water at the same time, and the flames fizzed for a moment.This time it made a little dference.The other animals of the forest, who were running away from the fire, suddenly stopped and stared at the squirrel, at the hare, at the wild cat and at the golden eagle.ldquoYou foolish animals, they all said, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the four of you.The golden eagle looked at the other animals and nodded.ldquoWe know, he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us and has our memories, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at all the other animals, and asked them, ldquoWill you help us The fox looked at the deer, the deer looked at the pine marten, the pine marten looked at the capercaillie, the capercaillie looked at the buzzard all the animals and birds of the forest looked at each other and had a think.The forest was important to them all in dferent ways.ldquoVery well, they all said ldquowe will do what we can do.And so they did.

In another case, a dferent business was told the virus was SARS, but their policy excluded SARS and so they would not receive a payout either.These discrepancies have prompted outrage from politicians, with several SNP members now writing to the head of the ABI, Huw Evans, demanding urgent action.Case study:Business owner devastated by art school fire faces second insurance fight over Covid-Alyn Smith, SNP MP for Stirling, and John Nicolson, MP for Ochil and South Perthshire, are among those who wrote to Edwards this week explaining that they are ldquobeing contacted daily about the issue.Their letter states: ldquoThese businesses cannot operate, as per UK and Scottish Government instruction, and as a result have no income stream ... They remain extremely troubled by the potential closure of their business as a result of the stance taken by insurers.Smith said: ldquoI raised the conduct of insurance companies in parliament weeks ago, and since, sadly, like all my colleagues have had dozens of constituents getting in touch about insurance companies either trying to get out of their obligations or being posted missing when theyrsquore most needed.ldquoThe insurance industry is in trouble, I get it, the scale of the losses over this pandemic are dwarfing anything the insurance or global reinsurance market have ever seen.ldquoI do think there is a need for the state to stand behind some or all of the policies to ensure people have certainty and am glad our Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewlis has been so active in pressing this case.ldquoBut it is simply not good enough.

We need to see the UK lose the laissez faire attitude and get in about these companies.Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said that the SCC was aware of businesses facing problems with their insurers, adding: ldquoEarlier this year, the Scottish Government and UK Government formally declared that coronavirus was a lsquonotiable diseasersquo. This would normally help companies seek compensation through their insurance policies in the event of any cancellations they may have to make as a result of the spread of the virus.: Fears grow over Covid- debt crisisldquoWe urge businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker to discuss and confirm the type of cover that they have purchased and whether or not it covers coronavirus. This pandemic is an unparalleled crisis in modern times and we urge insurers to be as collaborative and supportive as possible.rsquorsquoHowever, the ABI says that, while insurers are preparing to pay out up to poundbn in total to cover travel, retail and entertainment industries, they simply cannot be responsible for funding everyone who has lost out during the pandemicthey do not have policies which cover them.The body is also calling for talks with the Government on how to make pandemic cover more affordable for all firms, in case such an unprecedented situation arises in the future.An ABI spokesman said: ldquoInsurers understand that this is a very worrying and uncertain time for all businesses. Some businesses may have bought pandemic insurance that will pay out for Covid- but most will have not.ldquoIt is expected that coronavirus-related claims will be well in excess of pound billion in the UK spread over at least a dozen dferent types of insurance, including cover for business.ldquoNo country in the world is able to offer widespread pandemic insurance. If insurers paid out for cover that wasnrsquot included in contracts it would be a shortcut to their insolvency. For pandemic insurance to be more widespread, there needs to be some form of government support. Once we are through this we need a debate about how this can best be achieved.:Coronavirus: A timeline showing the UK regions with the highest number of casesWatchdogs the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service said they were aware of the problems affecting firms, with the FCA confirming they had already started receiving complaints about insurers failing to pay out."},{"url":null,"title":"Silence and the lambs  country life and memories of hard times gone by","story":"Had anyone been so sneaky, it would have been a bad move. The place was an Aladdinrsquos cave of implements for cutting, sawing, pounding, impaling. If you owned a Texas ranch and had a yearning to renew the fences, everything yoursquod need is here. So tooyou had to exterminate rats or mice, wasps, beetles, or any other pest that was getting in your way. There was a corner devoted to horses, with enough combs, brushes and hoof-picks to tart them up for Ascot. And there were elixirs and ointments and dips not only for horses but for sheep, pigs and cattle.The store is well placed, beside an auction market. Hundreds of metal corrals encircle the trading hub of this historic mart, the first of its kind in Scotland. It was opened in  by a butcher whose we realised he could do better for himself, and persuaded him to go into the auctioning business.Early in the morning, several times a week, farmers pass our cottage, heading for the mart with lorries and trailers packed with cattle and sheep. A short while later they rattle back home empty. In the present lock-down they are almost the only traffic going by, and I picture all us villagers lting our heads from whatever wersquore doing to watch. Tractors are even more exciting. One went past four times in each direction the other Sunday ndash just turning my head made me feel wiped out.At this time of year, tractors are busy harrowing and fertilising, but the most important activity is lambing. Irsquove never understood why, at Easter, we celebrate with chocolate rabbits when it is newly arrived lambs we should be thinking of. Everywhere you look there are picture-book hillsides of grazing ewes, eating asat an all-day buffet, while their infants dance like popcorn all over the place.By March, lambing season is in full swing, and gravelly bleating is, for me, the sound of spring. As daffodils splash verges and woods with colour, lambs cavort with no thought for tomorrow . The other day, on my way home from a hardware store ndash we needed to repair our wood-burning stove ndash we passed a field whose corner had been fenced off to create a maternity ward. The midwersquos caravan was parked among them, presumably making the midnight sht a little less arduous. Two lambs, sitting as close as eggs in a box, stared at me with beady black eyes, so motionless they appeared not even to blink. At a few days old, they were brilliant white, asstraight out of the washing machine. Their mother, in contrast, was a mess. Her filthy fleece hung off her in shreds, like a catwalk model swaggering down the podium, her woolly cape worn so low off the shoulder it almost trips her up.For any ewe about to go into labour, seeing a new mother in such a ragged state can do nothing for their nerves. Nature is meant to take its course easily in the sheep pen, with none of the coaxing, hand-holding or pain relief humans generally need. And when it comes to the farmyard, most of the time thatrsquos how it works. But as anyone who read James Herriot as a youngster knows, things can quickly go wrong. When they do, it iniably requires middle-of-the-night trips to snow-bound barns, and armpit- gloves.Sheep, a vet once told me, are always finding new ways of dying. Whether during pregnancy and birth, or out on the summer hills, their capacity to self-destruct is impressive. I spare you the details over your quailsrsquo eggs and kedgeree. I spent a lot of time, once, talking to hill sheep farmers, shepherds and vets for a book I was writing. Studying a veterinary textbook on ruminants and their ailments, and the photos in particular, was the most effective diet I ever went on.It made me realise how stoical these creatures are, and how much we take them for granted. With our streets empty and silent, and the knowledge of a highly contagious disease on the loose, these eery times are reminiscent of the dreadful Foot and Mouth outbreak in . Back then, throughout East Lothian where I lived, and in Dumfries and Galloway, where friends were farmers, there was a deathly hush in the countryside. The sight of empty green slopes, where there should be flocks and herds, was a definition of abnormal. As was driving through disinfectant at the gates of every farm. Worst of all were Hieronymus Bosch landscapes of smoking pyres. To blot out the sight and smell, farmers closed windows and curtains.Until that calamity I had never fully appreciated how big a part farm animals play in my understanding and enjoyment of the country. Now that it is us who are under threat, the tables are turned. But for all the bucolic charm of seeing lambsrsquo tails whirling like windmills as they suckle, this season is becoming a headache for farmers. Until Covid-, their main worry was the impact Brexit would have on trade deals and the price of home-reared meat. All that seems far off right now. With some abattoirs and most international borders closing, the farm calendar of breeding, rearing and slaughtering is at grave risk of disruption in the coming months. Among the lessons this crisis might teach us is the value of locally grown produce, and the necessity of being as self-sufficient a country as possible.While we get through this unnerving situation, those of us who live within sight and sound of frolicking lambs, or who follow media-savvy shepherds online, are grateful.

But as whisky expert Angus MacRaild was about to find, behind the doors of the impressive property lurked an intoxicating and quite unexpected treasure trove unlike anything he had ever seen before.ldquoI was in the middle of Colorado, several thousand feet above sea level and feeling rather spaced out from jet lag, he recalls.ldquoI was quite discombobulated anyway. But inside this grand house and down the stairs in the basement was a wooden led room ndash a whisky cellar.As he crossed the tartan carpet, his jaw dropped. ldquoThe wooden shelves stretched from the carpet to rafters, specially designed for this whisky collection, he recalls.ldquoNo-one knew about this. It was like a preserved Aladdinrsquos Cave of treasures. It was remarkable.Whisky expert MacRaild had been dispatched to the high plains of Colorado to check out a collection of malt whiskies gathered by a very private enthusiast.What he found was a real-le whisky galore.On each shelf was crammed bottle after bottle of single malt whisky rarities. A  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old worth an eye-watering pound million, bottle after bottle of  Black Bowmore ndash each one estimated at pound, ndash a Glenfiddich  Rare Collection , one of just  bottles ever produced, and dozens of highly sought-after bottles from lost distilleries: Dallas Dhu, Glenugie, Killyloch, some almost a century old.Still reeling from encountering one of the worldrsquos most stunning and secret collections of single malt whisky, MacRaild spotted something  that would make his heart sing.ldquoAt the back was a typical pub wood bar with a gantry and a wee sink. It was jammed full of bottles.ldquoIt was ridiculous, he laughs. ldquoThere would be a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.ldquoThat was his drinking stock, stuffed behind the bar, ready to be drunk.ldquoThat told me this collector was first and foremost a drinker who loved the social aspect of Scotch whisky.It seemed Gooding ndash who had been raised surrounded by soft drinks bottles so could be forgiven for enjoying the clink of a glass bottle against a tumbler ndash wasnrsquot collecting because he wanted to make a buck. Rather, this was a man who quite simply adored a decent dram.In the coming week, Perthshire-based Whisky Auctioneer will carry out the second part of its sale of Richard Goodingrsquos single malt whiskies ndash named ldquoThe Perfect Collection.The first, in February, saw more than , malts from the collection attract , bidders from  countries. Highlights included a rare Macallan  Valerio Adami -year-old which alone sold for a record-breaking pound,.It raised more than pound million.The second instalment of the collection consisting of almost , bottles went on sale on Friday and will continue for a further eight days. It is expected to achieve a similar sum.Part of the collectionrsquos charm, says MacRaild, is it eccentricity, quality and the fact that no-one knew it was there.ldquoIt was collected before whisky collecting took off as a global phenomenon,\" he says. \"It was an age of innocence when collecting whisky was a niche thing.ldquoThe internet came and changed the face of what was just a hobby.Born in Denverrsquos wealthy Belcaro neighbourhood in , Richard Goodings financial clout to lavish cash on fine whisky was never a problem.His grandfather, James A Gooding, launched the Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Denver in , supplying bottles of soft drink across Colorado and parts of surrounding states.After his father retired, Gooding took over as owner and chief executive officer. However, his tenure only lasted from  to  when, aged , he decided to sell the company back to the parent corporation.The move brought him a fortune ndash his wealth was rumoured to be in the region of  million.And what better way to celebrate than with a dram or two However, nipping to his local Walmart was not going to bring Richard Gooding the liquid treasures he sought.His personal pilot, a silver-haired chap called Kirk with a bushy white moustache, recalls frequent jaunts across the Atlantic with Gooding in search of single malt whiskies.Speaking in a video produced for the Perthshire company organising the sale of Goodingrsquos collection, Whisky Auctioneers, he offers a fascinating insight into the lestyle that money can bring.ldquoWe went to Ireland, Scotland,  or  trips specically for auctions for purchasing whisky, he says.ldquoWe pulled up to Talisker and just knocked on the door. People answered and they gave us tours. It was before all the tasting rooms were open and all the displays and stuff like that.ldquoHe would go to Macallan and start taking to the people, saying lsquoOkay, I would like to have this one and this and that one and that onersquo.ldquoAnd they are looking at him and saying, lsquoDo you want this, or this rsquo And he would say lsquoI want them all!rsquo.ldquoHe was into the whisky business long before it became as popular as it is today, he adds.ldquoHe tasted a lot of them when we were on these trips, but the majority of his purpose was to have a collection of one of everything that was ever made.ldquoThe lsquoperfect collectionrsquo.Gooding, with a self-taught knowledge of whisky and very deep pockets, enjoyed a warm welcome at distilleries which were still to witness the global explosion in whisky collecting that exists today.ldquoIt was a golden age when you could find an incredible array of bottles, adds MacRaild.ldquoApparently he just turned up and bought stuff. He would go around Speyside with his driver and stop off at distilleries to see what was interesting.ldquoHe would go to Gordon  MacPhail, the whisky specialist shop in Elgin which had incredible stocks, and fill his boots.Gooding bought at the perfect time ndash many of the bottles he acquired  years ago for a few hundred pounds are now worth several thousands.ldquoRichardrsquos mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery, said his we Nancy, who he had met at high school in Denver.Perhaps she was too busy enjoying her collection of horses to pay much attention to her husbandrsquos wood-led cellar, groaning with bottles and where he would happily consume parts of his collection at the bar.ldquoHe opened a lot of bottles with his friends, says MacRaild, who has helped to catalogue the collection for the auction sale.ldquoYou would find a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would have cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.Yet, perhaps strangely for a man who built one of the worldrsquos most impressive whisky collections, his lersquos passion is absent from the obituary in the Denver Post following his death at the age of  after an -year struggle with melanoma.Described as a ldquoquiet and generous philanthropist who did not enjoy the limelight, among his interests ndash aviation, boat design, architecture, music, language, food and travel ndash whisky does not get a mention.ldquoHe was a person who enjoyed the concept of design, his obituary adds, perhaps an explanation for those remarkable wooden shelves, heaving with bottles of ious shapes, some with artistically designed labels, others strikingly plain, such as the most expensive of the current lot, that  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old And like that perfectly arranged collection, he took pride in presentation: he didnrsquot do ldquodressing down, preferring a well-cut suit worn with a carefully-chosen shirt ndash he would always wear pink on a Wednesday as a tribute to all fighting breast cancer.His colourful collections of shirts were matched by one of his ldquosignature Leonard Paris silk ties.ldquoHis collection of ties has to be record-setting for quantity and iety, his obituary adds.Of course, ties are not what Richard Gooding is now known for.Experts who have sted through his whisky collection have described it as one of the most exciting discoveries of the whisky world. Itrsquos ldquojaw-dropping, ldquonothing short of overwhelming, ldquoeclectic and ldquopeerless, they say.Yet MacRaild says Richard Gooding was probably no dferent to the rest of us.He simply loved a dram.ldquoOnce you are bitten by the Scotch bug, thatrsquos it for le.

The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year before , and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today.This is an incredibly rare example, bottled under the Largiemeanoch label, a brand devised for a series of private bottlings for The Howgate Wine Co in Edinburgh in the late s.A legendary bottle of whisky, distilled at Bowmore in  and bottled from a vatting of three sherry casks. A -year-old was also bottled.Glenlivet Liqueur Scotch Mayor, Sworder and Co circa sThis was bottled by Mayor, Sworder  Co, a fine wine merchant from London. Up until the mid-s, the company also had many dealings in spirits, bottling whisky and gin. The firm contracted blends from Bulloch Lade, but also produced its own label called Red Monogram.It regularly received fillings of Glenlivet and Ardbeg for its production, and in earlier years, sought-after Longmorn malt as well. These casks would occasionally be bottled as single malts for the companys more discerning customers, as was the case here. Its Glenlivet was often pre-vatted for blending purposes, so bottled as a single malt here with an undiscernible vintage or age statement. This was bottled at some point in the early s.The early reverence for this now iconic Speyside distillery is clear in the wax dipping of these bottle tops, a practice the firm usually reserved for its high-end vintage port.Glenfiddich  Peter J RussellGlenfiddich was an early advocate of the single malt Scotch category, and its faith is rewarded today by being one of the best-selling Scotch brands in the world. It became the first distillery to market its single malt brand in , and was the first to open its facility to visitors. Glenfiddich was an important trailblazer in the whisky industry, whose contribution cannot be forgotten. The scale of its operation today is a testament to this.This is a spectacular example of one of the distillerys early single malts, bottled here especially for Peter J Russell  Co in Edinburgh.Pre-war vintages in single malt are exceptionally rare, particularly from distilleries like Glenfiddich. This is a real opportunity to own a true piece of whisky history.Longrow  First Distillation - Last CaskFirst distilled in , Longrow is the peated single malt produced at Springbank distillery. Although very popular, Longrow remains an elusive whisky, with only - casks of it filled at the distillery each year. Early champions of this spirit included the legendary Italian bottler, Silvano Samaroli, who bought and bottled a number of famous casks from the inaugural vintage, and is credited by many with a good deal of the brands success.

So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away.

Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace.

Unlike in England which limits the number of dogs which can be used to just two, there is no limit to numbers in Scotland.According to anti-bloodsport campaigners, a lack of clarity in the law has opened the door to the risk of hunts continuing to use packs of dogs, raising concerns that foxhunting with hounds is continuing in all but name.Police Scotland has also previously suggested that the law banning fox hunting in Scotland is unworkable and creates a level of confusion which can deflect from the spirit of the law.Moves to strengthen the law which were to be included in forthcoming Scottish Parliament business have now been put on hold as a result of the current health crisis.Campaigners are now calling for political parties to enshrine a change in foxhunting legislation in their manestos for next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament elections.The League Against Cruel Sports say they filmed incidents at the JedForest hunt at Jedburgh and the Duke of Buccleuch hunt near Eccles in the Scottish Borders.Footage captured on  December during the JedForest hunt appears to show a pack of hounds on the scent of a fox. The charity says it believes the JedForest Hunt was encouraging its hounds to search for and chase foxes.Steven Irvine, Police Scotland Wildle and Enviromental Crime Officer said: ldquoOn Tuesday,  December, , a complaint was made to police about a fox hunt in the Jedburgh area. Our enquiries are continuing into this matter.In the second film also involving the JedForest hunt on March  this year, a fox is seen bolting after it was dug out from underground. The hunt then attempts a gunshot before the pack of hounds chases down the fox.In the final clip, a huntsman from the Buccleuch hunt is seen throwing a dead fox into a pack of hounds near Eccles in the Scottish Borders. The incident took place during the hunt on March .In both cases, the films were shared with police however, no crime was established in either case.Robbie Marsland, Director of the League Against Cruel Sports, Scotland said: ldquoWe believe the law does not work. For the last five years we have been filming Scottish hunts and looking for patterns of behaviour.ldquoThey say they are shooting foxes, but in the first year we didnrsquot see a single gun. When they knew we were filming them, guns started to appear.They would be held up in an ostentatious manner.ldquoEvery hunt we saw looked to us like a tradition hunt looked before the ban except occasionally a man would be standing there with a gun.ldquoHunts often come up with a way of protecting themselves and for the police to say they donrsquot think itrsquos possible for a prosecution.Campaigners want new legislation which would reduce the number of dogs used during a hunt to just two, and a clause that would outlaw the practice of laying a fox scent for hounds to follow ndash known as trail hunting. Popular in England, there are concerns that it can lead to hounds confusing scent baits with live animals.Countryside Alliance Director Jamie Stewart criticised the campaignersrsquo methods and insisted hunts in Scotland were abiding by the law.ldquoOnce again the LACs have reverted to the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and using heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices in an attempt to deceive the general public and to try and influence politicians.He added: ldquoScottish Mounted Fox hound packs operate a legal pest control service to comply with the Protection of Wild MammalsAct .ldquoThe impact of fox predation on livestock, red-listed, and other vulnerable, ground-nesting birds is well-documented.ldquoIn addition to this, scientic research tells us that foxes could be responsible for the savage death of up to , lambs in Scotland every year.

Indeed, some estimates suggest the extra shared cost for the UK could be around pound trillion, which would increase the national debt by  per cent.Basically, this means that there has been a signicant \"material change\" in Scotlands financial position since the last SNP conference when all sorts of fancul promises were made about establishing our own currency and so on. Compounding the problem for an independent Scotland has been the crash in oil prices, which at the current level would produce little or no tax revenues. Furthermore, there are serious isions opening up in the EU with key politicians in Italy and Spain calling for \"common debt\" , otherwise the \"very existence\" of the EU would be at stake.Taking the above into consideration there are now no credible commentators left who believe there is the slightest chance that Scotland could leave the UK or that it would be in our interests to join a ided EU. Perhaps it is now time for Ms Sturgeon to be honest with her followers and explain that there has indeed been a \"material change\", but this time it means they need to accept the cost of leaving the UK is too great for at least a \"generation\" or more to come.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.I FOUND much to agree with in Doug Maughan and Iain Millars lettersabout Labour and its new leadership.

In fact, Im one of a growing number who think devolution has failed and should be morphed into something more agile and effective.Reduce the bloated  MP and MSP count to  talented MPs, boost the Scottish Offices power in Westminster and power in Scotland by having ministers in political charge of the main devolved departments and a civil service immune to the bullying and patronage that seems to have infected Holyrood.And get behind Andy Burnhams City Region vision that is working so well in Manchester.I have heard it explained at These Islands and a conference run by Aberdeen City and Shire, whose administrations, frustrated by SNP centralised, back the idea.Scottish Labour leaders could do worse than pay a visit to Aberdeen, see how effectively the joint Labour and Conservative administrations are working, copy their ideas and reverse the bulky, vindictive suspension of its Labour group.There is a long way to go.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.IF the Scottish Labour Party is serious about trying to regain lost ground, and to provide a credible opposition to the SNP, it must get rid of its current ineffectual leader, who has been a complete disaster.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years. Dferent formations may be used, depending on how many defenders, midfielders, or forwards are worthy of inclusion.Email me at j.tait@shetlandtimesyou have any suggestions..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MFS21-1.jpg","title":"theres gold on those","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSeaweed in abundance was a ‘golden fringe’ to island le and for centuries provided food, fodder and fertilizer.. forexample # whether cast ashore by tideand storm or cut manually, and dferences in dialect which may reflect local dferencesin species types and uses to which they have been put over the generations.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run.

But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management. We had great lads and not once did they let their heads go down in those early challenging years.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3069609.jpg--.jpg?1586507454000\n","title":"ve mural planned after covid casts doubt over street party","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a special community celebration in Ballykeel to mark the th anniversary of VE day have had to drastically re-scaled.Ballykeel  Moving Forward community group had hoped to combine the best elements of a party with some great historical insights into the local connection of what became known as the peoples war.But that was before the restriction rules imposed due to the COVID outbreak.However, group members Pat and Jean Rainey remained determined to mark VE day which stands for Victory in Europe when the Allies completed the task of defeating Nazi Germany.VICTORYTo that end, the pair have been busily making materials for a special VE day wall mural to be placed on a wall overlooking Crebilly Road just opposite the entrance to Tesco.Jean said: “The victory came after six long years of war and at a terrible human cost.We wanted to blend in some enjoyable activities for our young people with some historical education - the sacrices made in the Second World War cannot be forgotten - but COVID scuppered those plans.We had organised WW era costumes and a special exhibition featuring photographs of many of the men and women from the local area who played their part in the conflict.”Now, members of the group will hold a ‘socially distanced’ commemoration when the new VE mural is completed on Friday, May  at .pm.

He described the row as typical Northern Ireland, adding: It is Northern Ireland politicians playing politics with people#s lives.

He earlier stated his intention to go to the Executive prior to making a decision.I believe the Army#s skills and logistical expertise could assist with the redistribution of essential le-saving equipment across Northern Ireland to ensure that all hospitals have the materials and resources required to fully enact their surge plans, Mr Swann said.Read More Sinn Fein criticises Swann’s request for Army help as death toll reaches A spokesperson for the minister said: The Health Minister publicly stated his intention to make a request for military assistance on Friday, April . That request was submitted and both the First and deputy First Ministers were informed of the decision.But Mrs O#Neill said the minister acted unilaterally and without consultation with Executive colleagues when he requested assistance from the Army. Mrs O#Neill - who wants to meet the Health Minister, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the PSNI to discuss the issue - added: Sinn Fein has made it clear we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives, protect the public and tackle the spread of coronavirus.However, no proposal to use British military personnel in the north for roles normally performed by civilians has come before the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O’NeillPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMichelle O’NeillMrs O#Neill said the Department of Health had hired a local civilian contractor to scope out building a HSC-led civilian field hospital.She added: The Health Minister has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure ventilators and le-saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most.On April , Mr Swann said: I#ll probably put forward a MACA request to the Executive office at the start of next week to make sure that process is in place, because I can#t afford to do anything that puts anybody#s le at risk.Mr Collins said: Any army, not just the British Army... is likely to be trained in nuclear, biological and chemical , and the army of the land is. They have the logistics, the trucks, other equipment, and young fit men and women who can do the job.Only in Northern Ireland, out of anywhere in the world, would you have anyone thinking twice. It is politics, people#s lives, people#s jobs, healthcare, everything takes second place to politics.Asked specically about Sinn Fein#s position, Mr Collins said: We have a saying in the Army -you are not helping, get out of the way.He added: In any country in the world getting capable, effective and ready assistance by an organisation equipped and trained to deal with this crisis in order to save lives would be an absolute no brainer... except in Northern Ireland. Saving lives is of course second to sectarian point scoring.When this is over people need to look back at their politicians and remember what their priorities were when lives were at risk ­- and it was not the lives and livelihood of the unfortunate folk of Northern Ireland.Finance Minister Conor Murphy on April  said Sinn Fein would consider a request for military assistanceit was put before the Executive.We are about saving lives and that#s the number one priority, we#re not about politics in this game at this time - all rules are out the window, he said.We are about saving lives and protecting the community so any assistance we can get from anywherethat#s what it lends itself towards then we will absolutely consider that, that#s our priority.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood tweeted that  people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I#ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let#s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.Justice Minister Naomi Long said Mr Swann has her full support, and the Alliance Party#s, for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people#s lives.Former DUP Health Minister Edwin Poots said it is Mr Swann#s job to keep the number of deaths as low as possible, and it is the role of the Executive ministers to assist him.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin PootsPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEdwin PootsHe added: I don#t carethe British Army bring their skills to creating an emergency hospital, every person whose le is saved in it ought to be glad of the help.For example, whenever the order for PPE was made with the Irish Government, which didn#t come to fruition, I had no issue with that because we needed it. I have no issue with bringing in the British Army and I don#t believe that anyone  should either.First Minister Arlene Foster said she fully supports the Army being used.Read More Arlene Foster hits out at Michelle O’Neill over Army’s coronavirus helpPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll does not support any proposals that give the Army a coordinating or security role to deal with the Covid- crisis.He said: Both the Tory Government and the Executive#s approach to the Covid- pandemic has been shambolic from the beginning and this latest proposal to bring in the British Army is further evidence of this. We are concerned about how this latest announcement may open the door to a security or military-led approach to deal with a health pandemic.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes Press EyeBy Jenna GardinerApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA financial support package for tourism firms due to go live next Monday may be too late, industry representatives have warned.Announced by Economy Minister Diane Dodds last Friday, the -day wait for the £, grant scheme may prove critical to the loss of many good tourism businesses and thousands of jobs, according to the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance .Firms in hospitality, retail and tourism can apply for the funding on April  with payments due around  days later. The money is intended to help ease cash flow pressures as the sector suffers the catastrophic economic impact of coronavirus.But on what would have been the start of the summer season, businesses have seen their tourism income drop to zero and are desperately trying to keep afloat until the scheme goes live.NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart called for interim payments to tide firms over.We are now pleading with banks and other financial institutions to work with the industry as they wait to submit business critical applications, she said. Jobs are being shed now, cancellations have already happened, businesses are ready to close now. The Assembly needs to make interim payments nowthese businesses and jobs are to survive.Firms are struggling to meet upfront staffing costs as they await the implementation of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and were relying on the grant scheme to fill the gap in funding.This meant we would have had an interim cash flow that would have plugged the gap until the furlough scheme went live, added Ms Stuart.However, as the grants have not been distributed, businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April much less start making grant applications.In the absence of immediate cash flow relief, the NITA said companies and jobs will be lost ahead of the scheme#s implementation.The tourism industry will be an important part of our economic recovery once we start to see restrictions lted and the impact of the virus receding, it said. We need to ensure tourism businesses survive through these unprecedented circumstances and be in a position to provide a future for staff and deliver for the economy.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The initiative is the brainchild of Kelly’s Eurospar, which has stores in Raacuteth Moacuter and Hatfield, and is supported by the Lynch’s Spar in Skeogh. Henderson’s Eurospar in Rossdowney, Glassagh Taxis and Creggan Enterprises. Adrian Kelly said it he felt it was the ‘very least’ the community could do given the sacrices the nurses were making. “The nurses are serving on the frontline, spending Easter in isolation away from their families,” he said. “A friend of mine askedwe might possibly help make things a little more bearable for them with a hamper of treats to acknowledge our appreciation. And the other Spar stores all thought it was an excellent idea – and signed up immediately. We are delighted to be doing it.” googletag.cmd.push The stores have assembled  hampers – each containing Easter eggs, chocolates treats, snacks and a bottle of Cava - for the nurses who are staying in the Holiday Inn. The first of the deliveries, organised by local volunteers, will be leaving Raacuteth Moacuter at .pm tomorrow . Last month, Eurospar teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Glassagh Taxis to launch a free delivery service for older and vulnerable customers who are unable to do their own shopping because of the virus. Raacuteth Moacuter’s Conal McFeely said the community response to the Covid crisis in Derry had been very strong. googletag.cmd.push “Our nurses’ courage and dedication at this worrying time has been steadfast and vital,” he said. “It is inspiring to see initiatives like this which recognise and salute the contribution being made by those on the frontline our behalf. “Let us hope that it is not long before our nurses are able tosafely to their loved ones to enjoy some much needed family time for themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

He said that when Secretary of State Humphrey Atkins meets Eire Foreign Affairs spokesman Brian Lenihan in Dublin later this month, he should remember his Governmentrsquos pledge that the future of Northern Ireland was a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, her Majestyrsquos Government and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.Mr Beattie said Mr Lenihan should be warned that Loyalists would not tolerate interference by Eire in the internal affairs of Ulster in order to prop up the SDLP or in any SDLP proposals for power-sharing or a Council of Ireland.ldquoMr Atkins should take note we will never surrender to any pressure from Dublin or London that would hasten the arrival of a united Ireland.

More than pound was taken and police also found that the front door, which had been forced open, was badly damaged.They also said excrement was littered around the balcony and that someone had urinated in the building.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford car ferry service experienced its busiest ever Easter period in its -year history. There was a marginal increase of  on last yearrsquos record total of , cars carried across, although the number of passengers using both ferries ped from , last year to ,.Inevitable delays developed in both Strangford and Portaferry as the two ferries tried to cope with the rush of motorists to the Ards Peninsula and Lecale coast.Easter Sunday was a particularly busy day for the ferry crew with , cars and , passengers being carried across mdash a considerable increase on last yearrsquos figures. Monday was again the busiest day of the year with a staggering , cars using the crossing and , passengers.The ferry superintendent, Mr Louis Fitzsimons, paid tribute to the work of police in Strangford in keeping traffic moving.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11182012.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, the statement implied that Sinn Fein’s objection was on procedural grounds rather than because in principle it opposed any Army role. Ms O’Neill said that “we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives” but added that Mr Swann “has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most”.In an interview with RTE on Saturday, Ms O’Neill said “we have to do everything necessary to save lives”, but then went on to say: “I don’t believe that British Army assistance is necessary at this point. I believe that all of our modelling indicates that we are coping, albeit in the most challenging of circumstances.”Three weeks ago in the Assembly Mr Swann said that his focus was on saving as many lives as possible and he would accept help from wherever it could be found.He told MLAs: “I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus. If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them.”DUP Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said that Sinn Fein was not actually trying to stop the Army being involved, but accused it of a “silly PR stunt”.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Poots said: “Michelle O’Neill would be better seeking a meeting with the republicans in her own constituency who entirely ignore social distancing than engaging in silly PR stunts about something she in reality has no intention of trying to stop.“Robin has my support in doing whatever needs done, however it is done, by whomever it is done.”With the exception of Sinn Fein, every other Executive party publicly endorsed Mr Swann’s attempt to secure support from the military in the battle against the pandemic.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said on Saturday: “Fteen people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I’ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let’s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.”Responding to Mr Eastwood’s comments on Twitter, Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Could not agree more. Robin Swann has my and the Alliance Party’s full support for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people’s lives. All and any help is welcome at this critical time.”First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Northern Ireland has been working together on tackling this awful disease. We need to keep at it.“When your loved one is lying in hospital, who built the ward will be the last thought on their mind. Let’s build the capacity we need. We fully support the Army being used to build necessary beds.”Ulster Unionist MLA and Royal Irish Regiment reservist Doug Beattie said that Sinn Fein’s rejection of help from the Army was “becoming absolutely tiresome”. He highlighted that the military had in recent weeks already been used by Stormont to create a temporary morgue, without objection from republicans.He added: “I guess few will complainpersonal protection equipment or ventilators are supplied via a military driver or a civilian driver orthe doctor and nurse treating them is military or not.”As in most countries battling the pandemic, the Army has been increasingly involved in the effort to assist health staff as they have become stretched.At the weekend the Ministry of Defence said that nearly  members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work.Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts.Although their responsibilities will y depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public.Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London.In London,  medical personnel from the armed forces will form  critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units.Engineers from the Army are also supporting the London Ambulance Service to maintain suction units used in ambulances.In Wales,  soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on April , ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks.Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England Ambulance Service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics.The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service.Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish Ambulance Service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people.“Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus.”Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a iety of other ways.Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country.Armed forces personnel made up of  drivers and  driver’s mates have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities.The Ministry of Defence said there are hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS based at distribution centres across the country, amid reported shortages of the vital equipment.Speaking on Friday night, Mr Swann told this newspaper that he hoped the military request would not be isive, repeating his view that the only thing that will ide people in this pandemic is whether they live or die.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

But we have to get that which is reliable. You just don’t buy, buy, buy for the sake of having got somethingit’s not suitable.“I think there are genuine, real concerns as to why we put so much effort and money into those sources, when it seems we have a reliable four-nations source.”The Department of Health said: “The Department has ensured that the Department of Health and Social Care in London is apprised of the proposed supply route. These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised. It would be a matter of great regretany potential arrangements were jeopardised by partial and malicious leaking.”The department was asked how the Nolan Show’s story could “jeopardise” any such purchase, but it did not respond by time of writing.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
